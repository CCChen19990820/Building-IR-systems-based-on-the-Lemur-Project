<CENTER><H3>Really Helping Dole Make It A Close Race?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Reporters want nothing more than, this year and four years ago,
to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the
fight, the close call....So it's in our best interest to make it
look close, to make Bob Dole look good." 
<DD>-- <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reporter Ellen Warren on CNN's<I> Crossfire</I>, September 20.
<P>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<P>
"The former Senator argued that voters have a choice between two
different visions of government... The ex-deficit hawk returned
to the centerpiece of his campaign, a 15 percent tax cut.
Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing President
Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason for this
attack. But between now and election day the Republican nominee
has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole plan."
<DD>-- Reporter Phil Jones, September 24 CBS <I>Evening News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
NBC reporter David Bloom: "So now Dole, who's complained about
Clinton's campaign of fear, is taking a similar tack."
Bob Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to
the White House."<BR>
Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame."<DD> -- September 24 NBC
<I>Nightly News</I>.
<P>
<BR>
"The same cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton seems to
work directly against Bob Dole, with many voters here calling his
15 percent tax cut idea a political gimmick....Many of the voters
we spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government
shutdown, for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for
attempts to trim Medicare specifically." <DD>-- ABC's Dean Reynolds
in Michigan, Sept. 23 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<P>
<BR><P>
<Center><H3>Just Three Months Until Bryant's Contract Expires</H3></Center>
<P>
"Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
<P>
"Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal, most
white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's out
walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?" 
<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran in part one of
three day interview series, September 30 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
Gumbel: "Do you think if those two victims had been, say,
Marguerite, his first wife, and Al Cowlings, his best friend,
that there would have been the same amount [of media attention]?"
Johnnie Cochran: "Absolutely not. And I think any person who
wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."
Gumbel: "Why? Because America doesn't care about black victims?"
<P>
"Most white Americans still charge that O.J.'s jurors didn't do
their job. You talk about a rush to judgment. They would claim
the same. They would claim the verdict was race-based. Do you
think their judgment of those jurors is race-based?"
<P>
"Do you think O.J. will ever get a fair shake in this country?
Will people ever let him live out his life and accept the fact
that he was acquitted?" <DD>-- Some of Gumbel's questions to Cochran,
October 2.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Clueless in Chicago</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were `guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven
to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." <DD>--
<I>Chicago Tribune</I>, September 5.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Tax Cuts: Crazy Candy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Pollsters, pundits, look at these numbers and they'll say this
thing is locked....There is no way Dole can overcome this. Why
doesn't he just accept it and be himself? Try to hold the
Republican Congress and get rid of this book, and get rid of
these crazy 15 percent tax cuts and speak from the heart?" <DD> -- NBC
Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert to Dole campaign manager
Scott Reed on CNBC's <I>Tim Russert</I>, September 22.
<P>
"Americans are forever grumbling about high taxes and big
government. You'd think promising a tax cut would be like giving
away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a
terrific theory! And so what if Democratic doctors say they are a
couple of quacks. Gene [Randall], have some candy!"
<DD> -- CNN analyst Bill Schneider on <I>Inside Politics</I>, September 14. 
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Welfare Reform: Hate That, Too</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the
bill is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under
the new bill a 60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy
families will end. It's been estimated as many as a million
children will go hungry. What are you going to do about that?" <DD>--
Barbara Walters to Bill Clinton, September 20 <I>20/20</I>.
<P>
"In light of the new welfare reform bill, do you think the
children need more prayers than ever before?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to
Children's Defense Fund leader Marian Wright Edelman, September
23 <I>Today</I>.
<P>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Rapping the Republicans on Rape</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"I think, generally speaking, most people would agree that the
partisan, that the smear tactics -- I mean, the going after the
family, and since when has President Clinton said anything about
Elizabeth Dole? It hasn't happened, and yet you see the
Republicans attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, who I agree has
made mistakes, but they [Republicans] have no boundaries, and I
think that yes, both parties are guilty of using smear tactics --
it goes back to as I said the origin of American politics -- but
I think the Republicans are quite frankly, better at it than the
Democrats, and I think most people see that and believe
that....Why don't you recognize some of the hypocrisy on the part
of the Republicans?....Well, for starters, a rape victim up on
the podium in San Diego when the Republicans oppose abortion." <DD>--PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe responding to conservative
criticism on Westwood One's <I>Jim Bohannon Show</I>, August 30.
<P>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>I Thought White People Were the Paranoid Anti-Government Wackos</CENTER></H3>
<P>
"As Dick [Gregory] was saying, a conspiratorial thing, something
that is genocidal that many African-Americans whisper and talk
about that, or was it simply an economic situation that they
thought this was a quick way to make money to send to the
Contras?" <DD>-- MSNBC <I>InterNight</I> host Ed Gordon to activist Joe
Madison on the San Jose Mercury News report that the CIA sold
crack to fund the Contras, September 19.
<P>
"[CIA Director John] Deutch reiterated last week that he has
asked the agency's inspector general to review the Mercury's
charges. The Justice Department has also launched a probe. But if
Deutch thinks anyone in black America is going to take the wordof those two organizations, he's mistaken. Black Americans have
been the targets of so much hostility that many of them would not
put it past their own government to finance the war against
communism by addicting thousands of people." 
<DD>-- <I>Time</I> national correspondent Jack E. White, September 30 issue.

"Some of the first hard medical evidence is in tonight for
teenage smokers who think it takes years for cigarettes to damage
their health. Bottom line -- don't hold your breath. You'll be a
wheezer long before you're a geezer." <DD>-- Dan Rather on the CBS

"Have you any doubt that Kenneth Starr and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that is purely
political?" "Bobby McDaniel, you said that your client is being used as a political pawn. Have
you any legal recourse but to sit there and watch this unfold?" "Given that you think this is
all just a Republican witch hunt, do you expect the pressure to ease somewhat after the
election?"<DD>-- Some of Bryant Gumbel's questions to former Clinton business partner and convicted

"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his
campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement: `Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with
Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in reinvigorating his Republican base. But
a top Clinton campaign official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him thanks for
me.'"<DD>-- NBC's David Bloom, September 14 <I>Nightly News</I>.
<P><CENTER><B> vs.</B></CENTER><P>
"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd
[at the NAACP convention]. That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak
at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning
and the All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an
insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial
divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential
campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<DD>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 <I>Nightly

<Center><H3>Fallows' Hillary Fan Club Application</H3></Center>
<P>
"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman? Probably so. From Primary Colors
to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in the World. Bill Clinton has
suffered when judged on the age-old standard of masculinity: military service. But female
observers, from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a catty ferocity they
would not apply to men. A man with a prim exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter
could testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a woman is an emasculating
schemer."<DD> -- New U.S. News & World Report Editor James Fallows in an essay titled "She's Lois

be for family values and yet be willing to deny a father the opportunity to spend time with a
critically ill child or a mother time with a newborn without fear of losing their job."<DD>-- Wall

<Center><H3>Intensely Competitive Puff Pieces About Gore</H3></Center>

"George Bush fumed about jokes that he had put his manhood in a blind trust to serve as Ronald
Reagan's Vice President. The young Dan Quayle never convinced the country he had the gravitas to
be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private, intensely competitive Al Gore has managed
the contortionist's feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's re-election
without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both brainy, moderate Southerners with an
abiding interest in the plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each other like
competitive brothers."<DD>-- <I>Time</I> Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss does, tonight he is next door in
the Old Executive Office Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity theory,
open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific metaphors in modern society. He's writing a
speech, and the elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet Coke
cans...Clinton may lead the country into the millennium, but it is Gore who truly embodies the
new century's possibilities and anxieties."<DD>-- <I>Newsweek</I> reporter Bill Turque, September 2.

"But most important is the Republican Party's recent record as the vehicle of white supremacy in
the South, beginning with the Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's
`Southern Strategy' in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to Nixon Democrats (later Reagan
Democrats) in the northern suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to escape
from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare cheats and to impose law and order, and they
fought against affirmative action."<DD>-- <I>New York Times</I> Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple on why

<Center><H3>Clinton Makes Life Great, Dole Makes It Worse</H3></Center>

"For most people in this country, life is awfully good. So Clinton doesn't need to raise any
issues. He just needs to point to his record and promise more of the same. The people who don't
have a great life right now -- the 39 million people below the poverty level, the 40 million
people with no health insurance, the 6.2 million people earning at or below the minimum wage --
are the people who really do have the issues. But Dole isn't about to reach out to them, and
they aren't about to vote for Dole or the Republicans. That would make their plight worse, if
that's possible."<DD>-- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his <I>USA Today</I> column,

"On paper it shouldn't hurt him [Clinton]. This is about one goofy guy. We don't even know if
the story is true. The picture that I saw in the New York Post looks very much like it was
doctored."<DD> -- NPR's Nina Totenberg, who first publicized Anita Hill's unsupported charges
against Clarence Thomas, August 31 <i>Inside Washington.</i>
<P>
"Here in Chicago, the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the speech he will be giving
to this convention and to the country tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very
upbeat convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll numbers to accompany it.
And a very important set of statistics about the economy today, which he will certainly point to
as evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along comes a nasty little scandal to
take the edge off the good news, at least for one day." <dd>--Peter Jennings opening the August 29
<i>World News Tonight.</i>

<Center><H3>We're All Afraid of Hillary</H3></Center>

"Nancy pushed Ronnie into an arms treaty with the Russians because she wanted him to win a Nobel
Prize. So maybe astrology was healthier than whatever the rest of the nuke-Managua globo-cops
were smoking in the Reagan White House. That Hillary should talk to Eleanor Roosevelt bothers
some of us less than the fact that her husband obviously doesn't....Isn't it amazing that women
have invented or designed or discovered the prototype computer, nitrate fertilizer, penicillin,
integral calculus, food refrigeration, space helmets, atomic parity, automatic flight control,
pulsars and even DNA, not to mention square-bottomed bags, ice cream cones, vacuum canning and
the gardenia. And yet we're still afraid of what they'll whisper into the ears of their powerful
husbands. Might we at least concede that the people we'll marry say more about us than the
people we select for the second place on the ticket of our glory-hounding selves; nobody elects
vice presidents, either. Our pathological fear of Hillary and any other uppity woman, whatever
her politics, is a form of foot-binding as well as a species of hate radio." <dd>-- John Leonard on
CBS's<i> Sunday Morning</i>, September 1.

"I think much of the opposition to Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a

"Did anyone else find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette, Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms...As Jesse Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a conservative Republican." <dd>-- <I>Time</I> National Correspondent Jack E.

Does that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked for over the years?....Eleaonr Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements with the President to herself in private, but there were times that she felt it was important to disagree publicly.

"Any time the Doles play the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was 17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and staying married gets you an inquisition." <dd>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson, September 2 issue.

"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying `Yes, the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's beencaptured by extremists in the Republican Party, the radical part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich.' Is that what you think?"

<P>
"He [Kemp] is a rare combination -- a nice conservative. These days conservatives are supposed
to be mean. They're supposed to be haters." <DD>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August 9 <i> Inside
Politics</i>.
<P>
<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3> No Class </H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will judge his time in office -- the

figure." <DD>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's emotional thank-you after a video tribute to Ronald Reagan, August 12 convention coverage.

<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3>The Republicans' Diversity Scam</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Women have not responded well to a message that at times has been considered too harsh, too
mean." <DD>-- ABC's Michel McQueen on the Republican convention, August 13 <i>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
"The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this
fight within the Republican Party has many women questioning how far this party will go to limit
their rights." <DD>-- ABC's Peter Jennings on the Republican convention, August 13 <i> World News
Tonight</i>.
<P>
"There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say.
Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it, or quite
the contrary?" <DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to NBC News Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, August 14
<i>Today</i>.
<P>
"You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive party, one that can
embrace the views of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out vis-a-vis
abortion, and the fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking because they
felt as if they were being censored, do you still believe you can call the Republican Party an
inclusive party?" <dd>-- One of seven abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 <i>Today</I>.
<P>
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote, `harsh, extreme,' even `radical.'
Do you see it that way?" <DD>-- Dan Rather to Jack Kemp on the August 12 <i>CBS Evening News</i>.
<P>
<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3> Republicans' Phony Powell Play</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Although his speech was generally well-received, the reception was restrained, and there were
boos whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed and also heckled dissent,
Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We
can expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."--<dd> <i>Today</i> co-host Bryant Gumbel.
<P>
"It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily designed for a broadcast image of
tolerance and diversity that's starkly at odds with reality." <dd>--ABC's Jim Wooten on Powell,
August 13 <i>World News Tonight</i>.
<P>
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that they don't think
this ticket, or perhaps this party, is supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
<dd>-- NBC's Maria Shriver to rape victim Jan Licence's victims-rights speech during August 13
<i>PBS/NBC Convention</i> coverage.
<P>
"Do you think this is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated by men
as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very much what happens in America with rape?"
<dd>-- Tom Brokaw to Jan Licence after her speech, August 13.

<CENTER><H3> How Dare They Attack King Bill </H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but
they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's
credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." <dd>-- <i>ABC Good Morning America</i> co-host Charles
Gibson, August 14.
<P>
"I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that
could be interpreted by some people as mean." <dd>--<i>NBC's</i> Tim Russert before Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison's August 13 speech (which NBC showed for barely two minutes).

<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3> Bill Clinton, Fiscal Conservative </H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not
seem to add up....A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally
conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton." <dd>-- <i>Time</i>
contributor George J. Church, August 19.
<P>
"If he signs the measure as it is, President Clinton will appear to have fulfilled his famous
pledge about ending welfare. In truth, he will have abandoned the vision that animated the
slogan. Having sought office with the aim of a redefined social contract -- health care for
every American -- he will be seeking re-election with a bill that begrudges poor infants their
Pampers." <dd>-- <i>New York Times</i> reporter Jason DeParle, July 28.

<CENTER><H3> Grandpa Bob's Acceptance Speech </H3></CENTER>
<P>
"I think there were some transcendent moments but some risky rhetorical gambles here, where Bob
Dole may have taken the risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than the grown-up
he most wants to be, and that could turn off some voters." <dd>--<i> ABC</i> reporter Michel McQueen,
August 15.

<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3> Carpet-Bomb the Radical Right</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Bob Dole is pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform language and planks

August 19.

<BR><P>
<CENTER><H3> Why Even Hold the Freakin' Thing?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"You said a second ago that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your side on
this issue, but the majority of people who'll attend this convention are not. Why then even hold
the convention if it doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people in the
party?" <dd>-- <i>Today</i> substitute co-host Matt Lauer to California Gov. Pete Wilson, August 8.

<H3>Chaplain-in-Chief?</H3>

"Mr. Clinton is clearly more and more comfortable now in the role these  
times have forced on our Presidents -- first mourner and  
chaplain-in-chief. But his moments with the families must have struck  
him as especially
poignant today, for when he left them in the hotel and entered his car,  
he buried his head on Mrs. Clinton's shoulder."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim  
Wooten on the TWA crash aftermath, July 25 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>Republicans Have Zero Tolerance?</H3>

"We begin tonight with what you could call zero tolerance....Today by  
the time Mr. Dole spoke by satellite to his party delegates, who were 20
already gathered in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject  
of abortion had disappeared from the party's platform." <BR>
<DD>-- Peter  Jennings, August 6 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
"The Republican Party platform committee has forced abortion rights  
advocates to walk the plank, the abortion plank. The committee handed  
Robert Dole a defeat, by turning down language endorsing tolerance 20
of abortion rights supporters."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas, August 6  
<I>Good Morning America</I>.
<P>
<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and  
sometimes differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source  
of strength."<BR>
<DD> -- Republican platform language.
<P>
<H3>On Top of the Big Stories</H3>

"Quite honestly, I haven't looked at whatever tolerance language they  
allegedly have in their platform." <BR>
<DD> -- Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman  
when asked by a caller about the Democrats' platform abortion language
on CNBC's <I>Politics</I>, August 6.
<P>
<H3>Wrestling Reaganomics to the Ground 20</H3>

"The old joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a  
ditch gets out of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there  
are a fair amount of assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan  
that are really, I think, under intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." <BR>
<DD>--U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer immediately after  
Dole's tax cut address on <I>CNN</I>, August 5.
<P>
"Americans might remember that the last time we tried to grow our way  
out of the deficit that the tax cut happened, the growth didn't happen,  
and the deficit was huge at the end of it. How are they going to explain  
this new version of supply-side?"<BR>
<DD> -- PBS<I> Washington Week in Review</I> host Ken Bode, July 26.
<P>
"Now [Dole]'s embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career -- so late in the campaign  
-- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that
the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a  
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."  
<BR>
<DD>-- <I>Newsweek </I>reporter Howard Fineman, August 12. 
<P>

<H3>Tom Brokaw: Hillary Still the Victim of Sexism</H3>
<P>
"Some of it, obviously, has to do with legal questions, as well,  
obviously. She's had to testify before a grand jury, but all that aside,  
and those are serious issues, do you think that this country is not as  
far along as we'd like to believe when it comes to dealing with gender  
equality?"<BR>
<DD> -- Tom Brokaw to Rosalynn Carter at the Olympics in Atlanta  
on MSNBC's<I> InterNight</I>, July 25.
<P>

<H3>Linda Douglass Shakes Her Pom-Poms</H3>

"The President again has had sort of an amazing week. The Democratic  
Party, which used to function like a herd of cats, has now very tamely  
crafted a very centrist Democratic platform that emphasizes crime 20
fighting. It talks about stemming the tide of violence on TV that is  
influencing our children, talks about school uniforms, talks about the  
death penalty, talks about tolerance for people who oppose abortion, for  
example. So, the President who was being abandoned by 20
his party just two years ago now has managed to oversee a party that has  
crafted this platform very much in his centrist image. Even though the  
background noise of what is loosely being called Whitewater continues, 20
none of it seems to stick to the President."<BR>
<DD> -- CBS reporter Linda Douglass, July 14 <I>Sunday Morning</I>.

<P>
<H3>We Lied: We Really Hate New Democrats</H3>

Sam Donaldson: "Congress had suddenly realized there's an election  
coming up, so all right, they're going to pass a bunch of legislation--"
Cokie Roberts: "Concentrates the mind."
Donaldson: "Like hanging, and in Congress's case, in my view of what  
they did, perhaps hanging would have been better. Because the welfare  
bill, we're going to regret as a country. It's not just anyone in  
poverty, it's the children. Throwing women and the children off the  
rolls. Everyone's for workfare, everyone's for changing the welfare system. Bill Clinton promised it. He said, however,  it would take $10 billion more to ease people down the ramp off this train. Instead, we just throw 'em off now and said [sic] `Good luck'!"  
<BR>
<DD>-- Exchange on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I>,  
August 4.
<P>
"[Clinton] knows that he is consigning helpless people to terrible  
hardship, and some to premature burials. He called the press conference  
to announce that he will sign the bill anyway....
Mr. Shumyatsky is in the U.S. legally, but is not a citizen. Thus his  
SSI checks will cease when the welfare bill becomes law. He will have no  
money at all. Perhaps he will set up light housekeeping in a park. Maybe  
he'll curl up on a grate. Maybe he'll do the
politicians a favor and just die."<BR>
<DD> -- Former NBC News reporter Bob  
Herbert in his <I>New York Times</I> column, August 2.
<P>
"Secretary, you find yourself now in the position of being praised by  
Newt Gingrich, at the same time that Senator Pat Moynihan calls this the  
most brutal piece of social policy since the Reconstruction. Doesn't  
that make you the slightest bit nervous?
"...You know far better than I do that you are rewriting the social  
policy of this country that has stood for the last 61 years, albeit with  
a lot of problems. Do you worry at all about the consequences? Do you  
worry at all that with a change this enormous,
people are going to get hurt?"<BR>
<DD> -- Two of substitute host Chris Wallace's  
six liberal questions to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, July 31 <I>Nightline</I>.
<P>
"The new landmark welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign  
won't be law for a while yet, but there is already a great deal of fear  
and anxiety all over the country about the impact it will have."<BR>
 <DD>-- <I>CBS Evening News</I> substitute anchor Paula Zahn, August 1.
<P>

<H3>Speaking of Formulaic Hagiography of S&L Cheats...
</H3>
"And don't labor to make heroes of the nonheroic. Air-brushing swimmer  
Gary Hall Jr., the spoiled grandson of savings and loan cheat Charles  
Keating Jr., by not mentioning that he was a major goof-off, 
blowing up mailboxes and tearing up golf courses, is formulaic  
hagiography." <BR>
<DD>-- <I>Time</I> columnist Margaret Carlson complaining NBC's  
Olympic coverage was featuring too many personal stories, August 5. 
<P>
"Friends of Hillary Clinton would have you believe she's an amalgam of  
Betty Crocker, Mother Teresa, and Oliver Wendell Holmes...The former  
Hillary Rodham grew up in Park Ridge, a Chicago suburb, where her father  
owned a textile company. She earned every Girl 
Scout badge, pulled a wagonful of sports equipment to her job at the  
park every summer, was elected president of her high school class and  
earned so many honors that her parents recall `being slightly  
uncomfortable at her graduation.' She organized circuses and amateur  
sports tournaments to raise money for migrant workers."<BR>

the January 27, 1992<I> Time</I>.

<H3>Donaldson's Dole Strategy: Go Left</H3>

"I want the Bob Dole who saved affirmative action in the Nixon  
administration. I want the Bob Dole whose civil rights record is  
excellent when it comes to his voting record in the Senate. I want the  
Bob Dole who is moderate, who wants the big tent idea, who doesn't want  
to punish all those people who don't believe abortion is like a certain  
wing of his party does [sic]. And I want the Bob Dole who wants to  
balance the federal budget rather than give huge tax cuts in a  
pie-in-the-sky, let's follow this supply side mumbo-jumbo. But that Bob  
Dole can't seem to get out. And if it doesn't get out, I would agree,  
that's it."<BR>
<DD> -- Sam Donaldson on ABC's <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I>,  
July 14.

<BR>
<H3>MSNBC: Not Much of an Alternative</H3>

"I was just looking at draft platforms, Republican platforms, from South  
Carolina, Kansas, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Michigan, Kentucky, Texas, and  
Mississippi, and all of them are uncompromising, all of them written by  
the religious right, all of them uncompromising on this [abortion] and  
other issues. Are you really comfortable in a party where there are a  
lot of theological imperatives being imposed upon a political platform?"  
<P>

"If Republicans are the party of opportunity for most Americans, the  
fact of the matter is that you Republicans have occupied the White House  
for 20 out of the last 24 years and the economic inequalities in this  
country have grown. There seems to be a failure of correspondence  
there."<BR>
<DD> -- Questions from Bill Moyers to Steve Forbes on MSNBC's  
<I>InterNight</I>, July 19.
<P>
"But if that platform in San Diego contains the very strong  
anti-abortion plank that it presently contains, aren't women still going  
to feel, despite all you've just said, that there's a not for welcome  
sign out?"<BR>
<DD> -- Moyers to Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, same  
show. 
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Keep Moms on Welfare: That'll Help the Kids a Lot</H3>

"Mr. President, before we get back to the Internet questions, I wanted  
to follow up just for a moment on welfare if I can. If in fact you sign  
the Republican bill that's likely to come down from the Hill, all the  
projections show that that will push, at least short term, more than a  
million youngsters in this country below the poverty line. That's a high  
risk for youngsters in this country who are already in peril." <BR>
<DD>-- Tom Brokaw to President Bill Clinton, July 15 <I>InterNight </I>on MSNBC.
<P>
"There is something very creepy about the welfare debate....The  
politicians have gotten together and decided it's a good idea to throw a  
million or so children into poverty. But they can't say that. The  
proponents of this so-called `reform' effort have gone out of their way  
to avoid being seen for what they are -- men and women of extreme  
privilege who are taking food out of the mouths of infants and children,  
the poverty-stricken elderly, the disabled....Old women, small children,  
the disabled. A country that would single out such individuals for  
deliberate harm falls somewhere well short of greatness."<BR>
 -- <DD>Former <I>NBC News </I>reporter Bob Herbert in his <I>New York Times </I>column, July 22.
<P>
<H3>The More You Know, the More You Believe in Nothing</H3>

"One reason the disaffection of moderate women has looked like such a  
sore thumb this summer, experts say, is that the moderates make up a  
disproportionate share of the party's highly visible elite. Many were  
activists who built the party before forces on the right took it over in  
the 1980s. Most are better educated than average Republicans, and higher  
levels of education tend to go hand in hand with more flexible stances  
on issues like abortion."<BR>
<DD> -- New York Times reporter Michael Wines, July 21<I> Week in Review</I> section.
<P>
<H3>The Religious Right Ruins Another Country</H3>

"Bar-Ilan Street has become a symbol of the religious right's power in  
the new government of Prime Minister Netanyahu....Added to the fears  
that the ultra-religious minority will be freer under the Netanyahu  
government to try to impose its views on the majority of Israelis are  
the fears of the Palestinians. They see the struggle for Bar-Ilan Street  
in a wider context. They fear the religious right will doom any  
meaningful negotiations over the future of Jerusalem."<BR>
<DD> -- ABC reporter Bob Jamieson on protests by Orthodox Jews over a major Jerusalem road not being closed for the Sabbath, July 13 <I>World News Tonight</I>.
<P>
<H3>We Should All Be Paid the Same</H3>

"Governor, a recent study of household income by the Census Bureau  
confirms that there has been, the gap between rich and poor in America  
is wider than it has ever been and it is continuing to grow. You are a  
great believer in the benefit of the free market economy, but doesn't  
something have to be done to change this picture? And what specific  
steps would you take as Senator to make sure the nation's poor and  
wealthy are more equitable?" <BR>
<DD>-- Question from <I>Boston Globe</I> reporter  
Adrian Walker to Republican Senate candidate Bill Weld during the July 2  
Senate debate in Massachusetts with Senator John Kerry (D).
<P>
<H3>Gun Control Would Really Stop Violence: Look at D.C.</H3>

"The first requirement for being nice is to refrain from killing  
someone, and there we have a problem. But isn't it possible that  
Americans murder each other at much higher rates than most other  
nationalities not because we are meaner but because we make it easier,  
through lax gun control?" <BR>
<DD>--<I> Newsweek</I> Senior Editor Jonathan Alter in a  
July 15 issue story on how the U.S. "is not as mean as people think."

<P>
<H3>Far-Right Supreme Court</H3>

Alan Murray, The Wall Street Journal: "Linda, you say this has been the  
Rehnquist Court, but what effect have the Clinton appointees had on the  
Court's decisions? How have they pushed the Court?"
New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "Well, I'm not  
sure they've pushed the Court, in so far as there's any, quote,  
`liberal' outcomes at the Court these days, it's kind of a holding  
action. These two, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, are liberals

how far to the right the spectrum has shifted in the last couple of

<H3>No Truth in Talk Radio</H3>

"Let me talk about something that has always troubled me everytime I  
listen to talk radio as I travel. Democratic or Republican talker, it  
doesn't seem to matter, there just doesn't seem to be a standard of  
truth. I mean, it's like you're not really news media. You're media, but  
not news."<BR>

reporter Martin Schram, June 23 CNN Reliable Sources.
<P>
<H3>Oh Sure, Reporters Wanted to Vote for a Republican...</H3>

Margaret Carlson, Time: "This study is bandied about so much it should  
just be kind of stamped on your forehead, John. It is stamped on your  
forehead, I can read it there. The two candidates, remember, Bill  
Clinton was a New Democrat. George Bush now looks like the most moderate  
of Republicans. It wasn't even a liberal-conservative thing."
John Sununu: "And he still couldn't get more than seven percent of your  
vote!"<BR>
Carlson: "Well, I mean look at the two candidates. It could have been  
your candidate, John, and not a liberal bias. Bill Clinton was a better  
candidate. Someone suggested to me `What if the candidate had been Jesse  
Jackson and George Bush?' George Bush would've probably won. What if it  
were Jesse Jackson and Christie Whitman? William Weld? A Republican  
would win. A Republican would win!"<BR>
<DD> -- July 3 exchange on CNN's  
Crossfire about Freedom Forum poll showing 89 percent of Washington  
reporters voted for Clinton.

"Dole had been invited speak to the [NAACP] convention yesterday, but  
declined. He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the  
All-Star baseball game. To those at this convention, this was quite a  
stretch and an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up  
here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and  
fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential  
campaign, Bob Dole might not be up to the challenge." <BR>

<H3>Margaret's Gossip Hypocrisy</H3>

"The press has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for  
the truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it. No one was  
surprised when The New York Post and The Washington Times reported wild  
allegations from a slapped-together and unsubstantiated book about the  
Clintons. But when a formerly immune host such as ABC's David Brinkley  
succumbed to the infection and gave airtime to the screed's author,  
retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich, the sickness had reached epidemic  
proportions."<BR>

<H3>Today's Double Standard on Sleaze</H3>

"Some of the allegations, however, are anonymous. Others are conclusions  
that are not supported by, certainly, enough evidence to convict  
somebody in a court of law. I am certain there are people that'll look  
at this and they're going to say `This is an illustration of some of the  
worst types of irresponsible journalism, character assassination.' How  
do you answer that?"<BR>

"Best-selling author Kitty Kelley has proven both her courage and her  
credibility with her no-holds-barred biographies of Frank Sinatra,  
Elizabeth Taylor, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Now she's out with her  
most difficult and explosive book yet. Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized  
Biography goes on sale this morning, and already people are running for  
cover, issuing denials from around the nation. Kitty, good morning...How  
you been?...This book paints a picture of a totally unethical, scheming  
social climber who lied and faked her way through life. Is that the  
picture you set out to create?...You won't deny that's what emerges?" <BR>

<CENTER><H3>Vote for Clinton: He's Not Venal, Just Incompetent</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Leon Panetta's explanation is plausible to me only because back
then, in 1993, there was mistake after mistake like this. And the
reasons usually were incompetence rather than venality."
<DD> -- NPR White House reporter Mara Liasson discussing Filegate on
CNN's Late Edition, June 9.
<P>
"They are the White House and there was a legitimate reason for them
to try to get their files in order. They made a mistake, or this guy
who was a military attache whose job it was to try to put this in
order made a mistake. When it was found out that he made a mistake,
apologies were made."
<DD> -- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang,
June 9.
<P>
"I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt right now...I
really believe this was a case of general incompetence....Does this
matter? I guess the real question is, beyond an opportunity for the
Republicans to have hearings and to sort of drag out a Whitewater-
type escapade once again, does this really matter?"
<DD> -- Los Angeles Times Washington reporter Sam Fulwood, June 15 Inside
Washington.
<P>
"I think this is one especially that's going to backfire. There were
not files turned over; there were summary reports of background
checks. These were not files of top Republican operatives, the way
the stories first suggested, but alphabetical lists of people who had
access to the White House. If they look at what actually happened,
they'll find out there's nothing there."
<DD> -- New York Daily News columnist (and former Washington Bureau
Chief) Lars-Erik Nelson in The Hill newspaper, June 19.
<P>
"Hate radio and innuendo is going to put Mrs. Clinton at the center
of this, and for a party like the Republican Party that has this huge
gender gap, targeting the First Lady on every one of these issues is
not going to be effective politics."
<DD> -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift on the June 22 McLaughlin Group,
reacting to the charge that Hillary Clinton protected Craig
Livingstone.
<p>
"The administration has adopted an it-was-an-innocent-
blunder defense on Filegate, and it makes sense: This White House
inspires a presumption of incompetence."
<DD> -- U.S. News & World Report Assistant Managing Editor Gloria Borger,
July 1 issue.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Filegate? How Dare Republicans Mention It</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"The politics of Campaign '96 are getting very ugly, very early.
Today Bob Dole accused the White House of using the FBI to wage war
against its political enemies, and if that sounds like another
political scandal, that's the point."
<DD> -- NBC anchor Brian Williams on the FBI files, June 8 Nightly News.
<P>
"For a year and a half, the Republican-controlled Congress has been
bent on holding one hearing after another, investigating the Clinton
White House. This provides them fodder for yet another."
<DD> -- CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson on the FBI files, June 9 CBS
Evening News.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Wiping Away the Whitewater Report</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"These two dueling reports, the Democrats are real hear no evil, see
no evil, speak no evil. And the Republicans come, I think, very close
to McCarthyism. They raise the idea of suspicious circumstances, to
almost just an assumption of guilt."
<DD> -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, June 22.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Hillary's Psychic Friends Network, Media Division</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Inevitably, Hillary's solarium seances will be mockingly compared to
Nancy Reagan's astrology...Still, the joking is bound to exaggerate
the depths of the First Lady's psychic revelation. As [book author
Bob] Woodward's account makes clear, Mrs. Clinton was only imagining
what it would be like to talk with Eleanor Roosevelt and Gandhi, not
literally trying to `channel' the spirits of the dead. A long-time
searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. Clinton had conjured
conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt before she met Dr. Houston. Mrs.
Clinton is not even the first First Lady to dabble with psychics or
mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant,
John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding all tried, in one
way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike Nancy Reagan,
Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her
husband.... "And to many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed
conspirator but a martyr. Last week, 1,200 professional women
clambered into a $250,000 fundraiser for the Democratic Party in
Boston to see Hillary speak. Women teetered on high heels standing on
precarious plastic folding chairs to catch a glimpse of the First
Lady as she worked the crowd. Is there anything to Whitewater?
`Noooo, she's just being bashed by the press,' said Joan McGrath, a
retired telephone worker. Why? `A lot of people don't like a strong
woman.' To voters like McGrath, Hillary looks just the way she does
to her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure,
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<DD> -- Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, July 1 issue.
<P>
"Such role-playing conversations are traditional counseling
techniques, and Ms. Houston describes Mrs. Clinton as beleaguered, in
pain, and seeking help...The unwritten subtext here, of course, is
that even here at the end of the 20th century there is a political
price to be paid for those in public life who seek help for their
private problems."
<DD> -- ABC reporter Jim Wooten, June 24 World News Tonight.
<P>
"Though somewhat of an embarrassment, some believe this psychic cloud
may have a silver lining. It could soften Hillary Rodham Clinton's
image as a behind-the-scenes power player by revealing a
vulnerability few ever see."
<DD> -- CNN reporter Kathleen Koch concluding a June 23 The World Today
story.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Two Roberts Family Tributes to Clinton</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"That's what the Republicans did when they had the White House. They
misused the FBI. The same way the Democrats to some extent misused
the power on the Hill when they had it when they investigated all of
those Reagan appointees and it was the Republicans who were screaming
`No guilt by association! No guilt by association!' Now the
Republicans are misusing their power. That report this week,
Whitewater report, was so filled with `might have beens' and `could
have beens' and `should have beens.' They weren't able to connect the
dots except with these long loops. But that's what you do when you
have the control of these institutions. Both sides do it and both
sides do it. Both sides do it!"
<DD> -- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on the Fox
Morning News, June 20.
<P>
"This has been a very clever thing that the Clinton campaign has done
on everything from '92, which is to say A, it's old news, and B, it's
politically motivated. And to be very aggressive -- and you've got to
give them credit -- to be very aggressive in going after the people
who are reporting it or the people who are leaking it, so there's a
backing off."
<DD> -- ABC's Cokie Roberts on Whitewater, June 18 Charlie Rose on PBS.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Scorching Talk Radio</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Why are there so many church burnings in South Carolina? Some people
say it's racism. Some that it's evil, or the violence from talk
radio, or the insecurity over jobs. But many people say it's the
flag."
<DD> -- ABC reporter Deborah Amos on Nightline, June 12.
<P>
<br><P>
<CENTER><H3>Living in Hillary's Parallel Universe</H3></CENTER>
<P>
"Most reporters who covered Bill Clinton were of his generation,
identified with him, had a lot of the same experiences, were about
his age, and they were harder on him. It's the coach's son. You're
just so worried that you're going to give him favorable treatment
that it goes the other way."

Television News Directors Association, on C-SPAN June 14.

Joan Lunden: "But it seems like there's more money being spent for the  
environment, or for the gun lobby, there are a lot of different groups  
together, not always in agreement. The federal government's talking  
about turning over a lot of the social programs to the states. What kind  
of programs, what do you think is the best way to approach this?"
Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund and  
organizer of the Stand for Children march: "Well the first thing is  
we've got to make a commitment and that's why...<BR>
Lunden, simultaneously: "Yeah, yeah."<BR>
Edelman: "...I've never seen 3500 groups come together across race and  
class to say we will no longer tolerate the neglect and abandonment of  
our children or the massive budget cuts or the dismantlement of safety  
net. We will not permit it...."<BR>
Lunden: "Gotta get the message out there and get people to rally around  
one of our most important problems."<BR>

"You've got a spectacular weather day down there. It sounds like the

"...All right, Jonah Edelman, thanks for spending some time with us this  
morning, and good luck to you today on the session. Sounds like it'll be  
a lot of fun and very helpful."<BR>
<DD> -- <I>NBC Today</I> co-host Jack Ford to Stand  
for Children organizer Jonah Edelman, June 1.
<P>
"There was a `Stand for Children' march in Washington today, joining  
people from all over the country who care about kids. But politically  
inspired right-wingers have assailed this gathering as a radical group,  
intent on expanding the role of government. In fact, the group includes  
the Girl Scouts, the American Academy of Pediatricians, and the Junior  
League. Only the self-centered, loony right wing would consider groups  
like this, in support for disadvantaged kids, as radical." <BR>
<DD>-- Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt's "Outrage of the  
Week," June 1 <I>Capital Gang</I>.
<P>

<H3>Bibi's Got a Gun</H3>

"At his final campaign appearance tonight, Prime Minister Shimon Peres  
was every inch the elder statesman, 72 years of experience. `Trust me.'  
That's his message to Israelis. While across town today, his 46-year-old  
opponent, young and handsome, has American politician written all over  
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has  
advised conservatives like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The  
consultant told [Benjamin "Bibi"] Netanyahu to stick to one simple,  
negative theme: Fear."<BR>
<DD> -- NBC reporter Martin Fletcher, May 27 <I>Nightly

<P>
"Right-wing hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu is declared Israel's new Prime  
Minister."<BR>
<DD> -- Dan Rather, May 31<I> CBS Evening News</I>.
<P>
"What we were all talking about yesterday was whether terrorism wins. We  
had a situation where the peace process seemed to be going along well in  
Israel. Then an assassin kills Prime Minister Rabin. Then there are bus  
bombings, well publicized, many, many people dead in Israel. And there  
is so much talk of fear in the election, and the candidate talking the  
most about it, Benjamin Netanyahu, gets elected. The question is, does  
terrorism work?"<BR>
<P> -- <I>Good Morning America</I> co-host Charlie Gibson to "The  
God Squad" (Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman), May 31.
<P>
"Let's talk about his words for a second. Because it's not that many  
months ago that a lot of people were accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning  
the flames of the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical tone for  
Rabin's assassination."<BR>

News consultant Fouad Ajami, May 31. 20
<P>
<H3>That Old Cliche: Bias Is in the Copy of the Anchor</H3>

"You know the old cliche that we've all used over the years is that  
bias, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and we're out there on  
the cutting edge of change on a daily basis. That's what news is all  
about. That's the essence of news....The people, by and large, who are  
the recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most  
part. They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they  
don't want to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame  
someone in some regard and they think therefore since we brought them  
the news of the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change  
or biased in favor of what it is that we're reporting....I think the  
fact that we're still standing, this day, 35 years after we...entered  
this business, is some, immodestly, some small tribute the fact that  
we've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."<BR>
<DD> -- Tom Brokaw at the National Press Club, June 11.
<P>
<H3>Reality Check:</H3>
"Today, GOP congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and  
given a battle plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it  
is long on promises and short on sound premises."<BR>
<DD> -- Brokaw the night the Contract with America was unveiled, September 27, 1994 <I>NBC Nightly News.</I>

expediency about two years ago?" <BR>
<DD>-- Bryant Gumbel to Tim Russert on a  
report showing Medicare will go broke a year earlier than expected, June  
5 Today.

<H3>Tacking Against Tax Cuts</H3>

"Often, his [Dole's] condemnation of supply-side tax cuts has reflected  
the austerity of his Dust Bowl origins. Dole dutifully helped steer  
President Reagan's tax cuts through Congress in 1981, but he spent the  
next several years trying to dam up the river of federal red ink that  
was largely created by that deal."<BR>
<DD> -- May 28<I> Washington Post</I> news story  
by Clay Chandler.
<P>
"Ross Perot has said that, repeatedly, that giving a tax cut now is like  
giving candy to the electorate right before the election. Senator, you  
were in the Senate, and Mr. Forbes, you were watching it very closely  
when Ronald Reagan was President for eight years. Cut taxes, 25 percent.  
The deficit, with a Democratic Congress I should add, went from 60  
billion dollars when he took office to 200 billion dollars when he left  
office. So we can cut taxes, but it seems to drive up the deficit as

<DD> -- Tim Russert to Steve Forbes and Senator Bill Bradley, May 26  
<I>Meet the Press.</I> Fiscal year 1989 deficit: $152.5 billion.
<P>
<H3>Cue The Battle Hymn of the Republic...</H3>

"How can anyone argue that Bill Clinton has not been a good President?  
Business should love him. The country has been in a controlled boom  
since he bludgeoned through by one vote his first economic  
package....Workers should love him. There are more jobs than  
ever....Minorities should love him. He has a terrific record of  
appointing women and minorities to judgeships and high federal posts. He  
has put civil rights back on the table after 12 years of Republican  
neglect....
"No, it makes you wonder what the President and his wife could have  
accomplished these four years if they had not been consumed by these  
scandals, these lawsuits and these clippings. By almost any measure, the  
past four years have been spectacular for many Americans. Still, if Bill  
Clinton had been a full-time President, if Hillary Clinton had been a  
full-time First Lady...
"Would the poor be a little richer? Would the old be a little healthier?  
Would the young be a little smarter? Would the nation be a little more  
prosperous? Would the world be a little less troubled? You wonder. And  
you wonder if he wonders."<BR>
<DD> -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner,  
June 11 USA Today.

<FONT SIZE=2>Wishing Away Whitewater<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of
fading away, it's kind of a shadowy thing now, it's going away.&quot;
-- PBS Washington Week in Review&lt;M&gt; moderator Ken Bode on
May 24, four days before the convictions of Clinton's business
partners.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;After all the right wing's huffing and puffing,
the Whitewater `scandal' is dying out in wisps of smoke. President
Clinton's main accuser, David Hale, is currently tangled up in
his own lies at a Whitewater trial in Little Rock. Hale has had
two years in the witness protection program to practice his story,
and it didn't survive two days of cross-examination.&quot; --
Former New York Daily News Washington Bureau Chief Lars-Erik Nelson
in an April 11 Los Angeles Times op-ed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Anybody, it seems to me, who gives a fair reading,
Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three
years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton.
The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over
again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one
example, and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate
and should be there.&quot; -- U.S. News Senior Writer Steven Roberts
on C-SPAN's Washington Journal, May 17. (13 stories on ABC, CBS,
&amp; NBC, Feb. 29-May 20.)<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Welfare -- $53 billion instead of the $100
billion in last year's Republican budget. Medicaid -- $72 billion
instead of last year's Republican figure of $182 billion. And
Medicare -- $158 billion instead of the $270 billion Republicans
wanted to save last year. A major goal of Republicans in this
election year will be to repeat over and over that they are not
cutting funds from Medicare. Republicans would increase Medicare
spending but at a slower rate then President Clinton wants, so
it infuriates Republicans when the President says they're cutting
Medicare.&quot; -- ABC reporter John Cochran on the GOP budget
proposal, May 8 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>vs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The GOP proposal would balance the budget in
six years by cutting Medicare by $158 billion, Medicaid by $72
billion, and welfare by $53 billion. Republicans also are proposing
$122 billion in tax cuts, targeted to a $500 per child tax credit.
These cuts are less severe than those proposed by Republicans
in their budget last year....And moderate Republicans believe
they have abandoned the drastic budget and tax cuts of last year's
budget that contributed to two government shutdowns.&quot; --

<FONT SIZE=2>Reagan's Dirty Jokes<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Reagan was an exceedingly likeable guy, just
a heck of a nice fellow, despite his politics. He was funny and
loved a good joke, the dirtier, I'm afraid the more ethnic, the
better. I don't think he brought very much to the presidency,
except charisma and success.&quot; -- Walter Cronkite on Cronkite

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Moderates&quot; for Carter, Mondale, Dukakis
and Clinton<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think what you have now in the mainstream
media is a bias against power almost. It's a sense of anti-incumbency
that we in the media always zero in on people who have power and
try to hold them up to scrutiny and I think many times we focus
on only the negative and I think that's what the politicians object
to. In a book I've just written about the presidency and the press
I talk about this. And I do criticize the media for being too
cynical in dealing with politics and public life but I don't think
it's so much a liberal bias I think it's more just an engine of
anti-incumbency....I did a survey of the White House press corps.
And I found that the overwhelming number of reporters in that
press corps identify themselves as moderates.&quot; -- Kenneth
Walsh, U.S. News &amp; World Report White House reporter, on the
May 10 Fox Morning News.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton,
two for George Bush, and one for independent Ross Perot....In
1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael Dukakis, only one for
Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In
1984, ten voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting
for Ronald Reagan, and four said they had not voted for a presidential
candidate. In 1980, eight voted for Democratic incumbent Jimmy
Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven
voted for Carter and two for Republican incumbent Gerald Ford.&quot;

House Versus the Press. Based upon Walsh's 1995 personal survey

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Dole has certainly shown understanding for
the handicapped, sponsoring legislation like 1990's Americans
with Disabilities Act....But how far does Dole's empathy extend?
He's helped the disabled but fought family and medical leave that
would guarantee employees the right to care for a disabled loved
one. He's been soft on the workplace and highway safety regulations
and gun-control measures that would prevent many disabling accidents.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>More Election-Year Lies About &quot;Cuts&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like many people here in Stark County [Ohio],
a strong political bellwether for national politics, Mrs. [Judith]
Snow has been shaken enough by the Republican-led Congress to
move to President Clinton for now. In her case, it was Congress's
effort to scale back Medicare benefits. Three-quarters of all
voters questioned here in a new poll think that cutting Medicare
was wrong, including nearly two-thirds of all Republicans.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Republicans' new plan also seeks spending

respectively.&quot; -- U.S. News &amp; World Report, May 20 Outlook
section.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;...at least the Republicans have made an effort
to position front and center this per child tax credit...as the
centerpiece of their tax proposals to kind of moderate the rhetoric
of last year which suggested that they wanted a huge tax cut for
the rich which was going to be used, paid for by big cuts on Medicare
and Medicaid in particular.&quot; -- U.S. News &amp; World Report

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The savagery is actually a throwback to an
earlier era. The [Wall Street] Journal editorial page resembles
nothing so much as rabidly partisan 19th Century newspapers that
routinely -- often brilliantly -- slandered anyone on the other
side of the barricades....If Robert Bartley, the Journal's editor,
hasn't been sleeping fitfully, he's even less of a human being
than his worst enemies imagine.&quot; -- Alter in the August 23,
1993 Newsweek on the suicide of White House lawyer Vincent Foster

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Just as the U.S. economy looked like it might
be headed into winter hibernation, it suddenly sprang to life.
The government reports today that the Gross Domestic Product grew
in the first quarter of this year at a brisk annual rate of 2.8
percent.&quot; -- Dan Rather on the May 2 CBS Evening News.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>vs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The country, it now appears, may be pulling
out of the recession. If so, it is doing so very slowly. The Commerce
Department says the economy grew in the first quarter of this
year at an annual rate of two percent. That's the strongest growth
in three years, but private economists say it is hardly enough
to create many jobs.&quot; -- Rather on the April 28, 1992 CBS
Evening News.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You Mean the Camera Was On When I Admitted
That!&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There is a liberal bias. It's demonstrable.
You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long
time. There is a, particularly at the networks, at the lower levels,
among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine
I work for -- most of the people who work at Newsweek live on
the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias....[ABC
White House reporter] Brit Hume's bosses are liberal and they're
always quietly denouncing him as being a right-wing nut.&quot;
-- Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas in an amazing
admission on Inside Washington, May 12.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Brokaw's Great Men: Gorbachev Yes, Reagan No<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw: &quot;I think Gorbachev
is a great man in the 20th century because he forced his country
to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of communism and
to begin slowly to make a turn away from it....He can still light
up any room that he walks into. The eyes are flashy, you know,
and the great command of the language and the feel that he has,
the very physical presence of him. It's still fun to be around
him.&quot; -- From the PBS talk show Charlie Rose, May 2.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tom Brokaw: &quot;People will still be looking at
Ronald Reagan I think, too, fifty years from now.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Charlie Rose: &quot;A great man?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Brokaw: &quot;I think that history will have to be
the judge of that. I think that he was the right man at the time.
I think the country was adrift and he came along with his simple,
in the best sense of the word, philosophy about what was required
to get the country back on track, to kind of give the country
a sense of itself again. You can look at the economics of Reaganism,
for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy and
look at Iran-Contra and find all manner of flaws in there. But
what he did was give this sense that this is a great nation and
we're a great people and that we've got to get on with being that
once again. So I don't think he'll be a complicated Roosevelt-like
figure.&quot; -- Exchange later on the same show.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>I'm Not Saying That About You, Bill (...To Your Face)

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Dole's] got the nomination now. It would seem
to me the obvious thing to do is pull together and get behind
the nominee. And instead you have someone like Bill Bennett sniping
from one direction, somebody like Bill Kristol sniping from another
direction, and everybody seems to be already writing the stories
of `It's not my fault that he lost.'&quot; -- ABC reporter Cokie
Roberts on This Week with David Brinkley, April 28.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>vs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think that there is cause for paying attention,
and if that's what Bill [Kristol] has in mind that's one thing.
It's another thing though, and I'm not saying that Bill did this,
but some of his party colleagues certainly seem to be doing this.
There's a difference between getting Dole energized and writing
him off.&quot; -- Roberts, sitting next to Kristol two days later
on Good Morning America.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I Got These Cliches From Bob Schieffer<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The legacy of the Reagan administration will
be with us for years. The deficit under Reagan totaled more than
a trillion dollars. Someday we're going to have to pay those bills.
As officials look to cut spending and taxes at the same time,
we can't afford another round of voodoo economics....I remember
that campaign slogan one year `It's morning again in America.'
Well, it may have been morning for some, but for a lot of people
in this country it's become a nightmare.&quot; -- CBS 60 Minutes
correspondent Ed Bradley in an April 28 speech to Benedictine
University in Illinois, aired May 11 on C-SPAN.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>And They Say Gingrich is Too Mean-Spirited and Shrill
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;What the public now thinks is that the White
House, the President, brought the Republicans back from this extremist
program. They really didn't want that. It was a mistake to think
there was a huge mandate for, you know, poisoning the water, tainting
the meat, removing all these regulations.&quot; -- Margaret Carlson

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton is much craftier than George Bush in
avoiding the kind of `Read My Lips' vow that allows no maneuvering
room. He can rewrite his promises to adjust to reality. That opens
him up to `Slick Willie' catcalls. It also leaves him the option
to do the right thing.&quot; -- Clift in February 8, 1993 Newsweek
story.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Clinton's giving the best evidence yet of his
approach to leadership. It's about understanding, not threats;
accommodation, not confrontation; about getting people (or at
least Democrats) to sing the same song. The style is reminiscent
of another patient, nonjudgmental figure given to hugging in public:
Barney the Dinosaur.&quot; -- Clift in August 9, 1993 Newsweek
story.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The public might even be tickled to learn that
the prim and preachy First Lady has a gambler's streak. Hillary's
brief fling in commodities was possibly reckless, but it shows
a glimmering of a more credible, if more flawed, human being.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Al Franken was very funny. He's very politically

There were jabs at Newt Gingrich, who was there at the dinner

<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;But the Speaker is nothing if not a man of
ideas, some of which have been very controversial, for example
his gender theories. You'll remember that Newt said, and I quote,
`If combat means living in a ditch, females have biological problems
staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get infections.' Now
I read this and the image that immediately came to mind was that
of Newt, about 15 years ago, explaining to his 13-year- old daughter
that she had just gotten her first infection.&quot; -- Al Franken

<FONT SIZE=2>The Sinister Gas Price Conspiracy...<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Good evening. It's the question every American
driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price
of gasoline going up and up and up. Is it the free market at work,
the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even
something more sinister?&quot; -- Dan Rather, April 30.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;An estimated 9.7 million Americans make the

<FONT SIZE=2>Jim Wright: One Warm, Wry, Wise Crook<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like the man, Mr. Wright's book is courtly,
gentle, warm, wry, wise -- and florid. But this is not a volume
without virtue, just as Mr. Wright was not, as Mr. Gingrich portrayed
him, a man without virtue....his role in winning peace in Central
America is beyond debate....There are also some striking asides
about politics, and about the personal price of politics. More
than anything, Mr. Wright is an expert in that. He, after all,
was the man who gave back to the House, as `a propitiation for
this season of ill will,' the job he sought so lustily, enjoyed
so thoroughly, departed so tragically -- and, this book shows
us, misses so desperately.&quot; -- Boston Globe Wash. Bureau
Chief David Shribman on Wright's Balance of Power, April 21 New

<FONT SIZE=2>Welcome to Willie Horton Week in Review<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Judge Baer is a judge who recently ruled that
a lot of evidence in a big drug trial was inadmissible and immediately
the Republicans seized on Judge Baer, perhaps thinking he might
be another Willie Horton.&quot; -- NPR reporter Mara Liasson on
the PBS show Washington Week in Review, March 22.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He invalidated the search of a car in a drug-ridden

<FONT SIZE=2>The Unabomber: One Courageous Anonymous Killer<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;It could be argued that the Unabomber at least
had the courage of his convictions. He -- again, assuming the
feds have the right man -- lived in `wild nature.' He battled
the machine.&quot; -- Los Angeles Times columnist Peter H. King,

<FONT SIZE=2>Educate Illegal Aliens or Else<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Supreme Court has held that such children

<FONT SIZE=2>Saving the World<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I wanted to be a journalist because I wanted
to change the world. Yes, I came of age in the '60s. All of the
people I knew had a social conscience, and wanted to make a difference,
no matter what profession they aspired to. It was hell in the
'60s; between the civil rights demonstrations, the anti-war protests,
the assassinations, the divisions between black and white, rich
and poor, young and old, it seemed sometimes the country would
be torn asunder. And it was my belief that as a journalist, and
especially as a minority journalist, I could communicate what
the problems were to the American people in a compelling fashion
and I felt that once they were aware of why people were protesting,
why they were angry, they could understand the problems and we
could begin to solve them. All I dreamed of, as corny as it sounds,
was Superman's logo: `truth, justice, and the American way,' for
all people in this country.&quot; -- ABC's Carole Simpson accepting
an award at the April 2 Radio &amp; TV News Directors Foundation
dinner, on C-SPAN.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>True Confessions About the Republican Primaries<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;For a really good time, take the Candidate
Rate-O-Matic quiz, which asks a series of multiple choice questions
about where you stand on the issues...When you're done AllPolitics
sorts the candidates according to how well they match your views,
giving each a score. The closer to zero, the closer the match.
I took the test and couldn't get a candidate within 3,000, which
isn't surprising, I guess, since (full disclosure) I'm a Democrat
just like everyone else I know in the mainstream media.&quot;
-- Syndicated cyberspace columnist Daniel Akst on Republican presidential
candidates on the Time-CNN web site, March 18 Los Angeles Times.

<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote.
His manifesto, and there are a lot of things in it that I would
agree with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization
and pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an
extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond
any political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any
plumbing, he didn't have any electricity.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt;
Washington reporter Elaine Shannon on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal&lt;M&gt;,
April 7.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber.
Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting. The
original Unabomber -- the anonymous, hooded fellow, hiding behind
aviator glasses -- was uninteresting, a freak, a nobody. But Theodore
Kaczynski is someone very interesting indeed...I envy his disobedience....the
[manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can
be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force....If
Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly
not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have
many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our
front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic and manacled
before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber
set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society
that drove him to madness.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Boston Globe &lt;M&gt;columnist
Alex Beam, April 10.&lt;D&gt;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unabomber: He's No Leftist...<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;One source told the San Francisco Examiner
that Kaczynski was `disgusted with the widespread drug use and
liberal politics' at Berkeley. Maybe so: the Unabomer [sic] manifesto
is harshly critical of leftism.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Newsweek&lt;M&gt;
Senior Writer Tom Morganthau, April 15 issue.&lt;D&gt;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Yet no one, either at Michigan or Berkeley,
remembers Ted having any contact with the leftists he would later
excoriate in his manifesto.&quot; &lt;M&gt;-- Time&lt;M&gt; Senior
Editor Nancy Gibbs, April 15. The Unabomber manifesto begins:
&quot;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been
a disaster for the human race.&quot;&lt;D&gt;<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>....But the Right Wing's Still to Blame for Oklahoma
City<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bill Moyers, promoting April 12 Dateline NBC on Oklahoma
City victims: &quot;They're angry now that, most of the people
who were killed were connected, in one way or the other, to the
federal government. They thought of themselves as public servants.
Then politicians and talk radio turned them into faceless bureaucrats,
and finally the terrorists turned them into victims, and they're
angry.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bryant Gumbel: &quot;You mention talk radio. They
have some very hard feelings about talk radio and the hate being
spewed by some of those on the far end of the spectrum.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moyers: &quot;If anything, talk radio in that part
of the world is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves
are saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification
of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the government
makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances against government.
But this is, this goes beyond that, it's excessive. And these
people take it like salt in the wound. They drive around, they
turn on their radio, they hear some vicious attack on government,
and they think, `You know, if you strike the government, you kill
my daughter.'&quot; -- Exchange on Today, April 12.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Brown's Death: Great PR! <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There has been a huge push to get rid of the
Commerce Department and this has been, I don't want to sound too
cynical, but this has been a great PR experience, in a way, for
the Clinton administration's view of how to use the Commerce Department
to promote American business. I think it will be very difficult
now to kill the Commerce Department.&quot; -- National Public
Radio reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, April 6.

<FONT SIZE=2>Gumbel: Decency Over Politics<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Although many have praised Ron [Brown] lavishly,
I understand that no Republicans have yet expressed condolences
to the Brown family. Is that politics as usual, or is that just
plain bad manners?&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Rep. Charles Rangel,
April 10 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Out of respect for the memory of Ron Brown
and his grieving family, I am not anxious to prolong this story.
Like most people, I hoped that decency would prevail over politics.
Those involved will have to live with the truth.&quot; -- Gumbel's
press statement, next day.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Reality Check:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[GOP Chairman Haley] Barbour told Gumbel after
the plane crash that killed Brown last week, he issued a statement
praising Brown and expressing his `deepest sympathy' to Brown's
family. Barbour made similar comments on his GOP-TV cable show.&quot;
-- April 11 Washington Post story by Howard Kurtz.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Though Republican leaders did not attend the
memorial service or funeral, several sent condolence notes to
the Brown family. In addition, Mr. Gingrich, the House Speaker,
made special arrangements for Mr. Brown to lie in repose on the
catafalque used for President Kennedy's coffin.&quot; -- April
12 Washington Times story by Laurie Kellman.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Only Conservatives Would Let Liberals Solve Problems
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Let me go to the minimum wage though for a
minute...Ten million people would be affected by it. Most of them
live at or below the poverty level. And this Congress which is
trying to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit, which conservatives
used to tell us was the alternative, and refuses to do anything
about the minimum wage makes Marie Antoinette look like Mother
Teresa. It is just an outrage!&quot; Wall Street Journal Executive
Washington Editor Al Hunt, March 30 edition of CNN's Capital Gang.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If high crimes and misdemeanors have occurred,
by all means, the Clintons must be held accountable. But my head
spins to think of the time and energy the White House, Congress,
special prosecutors and legions of lawyers have spent digging
up and rehashing eye-glazing Whitewater details when they could
have been solving the country's problems.&quot; -- USA Today reporter
Leslie Phillips reviewing James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood
Sport, March 25.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Policing Police Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I hope I'm not the only one to notice that
Nash Bridges, Max Swift, and The Sentinel are all indifferent
to the rules against breaking and entering, search and seizure,
and even kidnapping. Warrants are an inconvenient waste of time
and the Miranda warning is never uttered except contemptuously.
This same contempt for pious legalities, this coarsening of our
thin blue line has also shown up recently on Law &amp; Order,
NYPD Blue, and even Homicide. It used to be that we could count
on TV to oppose the death penalty as we could rely on it to favor
integration. But you can't watch any cop show these days without
hearing an angry centurion gloat about the options of lethal injections
and electric chairs. Imagine that: Society has reduced television
to the lowest common denominator, which is a lynch mob.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>Bloody Cleanup in Aisle 13<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The safety of car seats, cribs, and toys are
the concerns of all you conscientious parents. Well, now you can
add shopping carts to your list. According to a recent study,
shopping cart related injuries account for 25,000 trips to the
emergency room every year. At least two deaths have occurred in
related incidents. In the last three years, 2,000 children were
hospitalized from shopping cart injuries such as skull fractures,
concussions, cuts, and bruises.&quot; -- Today co-host Katie Couric,
March 20. <BR>

Jack Kemp, March 6 World News Tonight.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Forbes's persistence matches that of the movement

<FONT SIZE=2>The McVeigh Update: Conservatives Still Incite Violence
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The torching of black churches throughout the
South punctuates the ugly rhetoric of the Buchanan campaign....In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to
Pete Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting
white resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of
the New Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder
if their coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past
18 months, while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative
action, more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern
and Border states have been torched....there is already enough
evidence to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames.&quot; -- Time
national correspondent Jack E. White, March 18 issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Republicans captured Congress by insisting
that the government itself was the problem....But the Republicans
played Robin Hood in reverse: taking from Medicare to finance
reductions in capital gains. But no one keeps up with Buchanan,
who, drunk on his early success, turns to medieval war cries.
`The peasants are coming with pitchforks!' he bellows at every
stop. It's comic, captivating, viscerally appealing -- and scary.
Those black-leather bikers and gun nuts turning up at his rallies
may not have mastered the concept of metaphor. Urging them to
`lock and load' -- and take aim at `Jose' -- is virtually a request
for violence.&quot; -- Reporter Jason DeParle in a March 17 New
York Times Magazine story subheaded: &quot;The presidential contenders
are falling all over themselves to identify with the lunch pail
vote. But it's all talk: The remedy is more government, and no
one will say that.&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Pat Buchanan: Son of Willie Horton?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think in some ways this is the natural payback
from a Republican Party that has flirted too much with code words
and Willie Horton-type ads, and when you incite that kind of feeling,
don't be surprised when it comes up and hits you in the face.&quot;
-- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg, February 24 Inside Washington.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Like a stain suddenly ruining the new carpet,
the success of Pat Buchanan and his alarming snarl -- xenophobic,
anti-Semitic, misogynistic, homophobic and racist -- has sent
the smug Republican family into a dither of accountability. `Who
let that pit bull into the house and why wasn't he housebroken?'
they must be asking, as if Buchanan is someone else's dog....This
is not some mongrel outsider but rather a purebred from the kennels
of Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan....Buchanan
speaks for a good chunk of the party faithful who have been lured
into the fold with a message of fear and hate and now demand to
be heard. These are the folks who take seriously the charge that
immigrants and uppity minorities are the source of all our problems.&quot;-- Former L.A. Times reporter Robert Scheer, Feb. 27 column.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;In the end, Pat Buchanan is a hater not a healer,
a guerrilla not a statesman. For all his flaws, Republicans would
be better off with Bob Dole, a man who thinks of his opponents
as `distinguished gentlemen,' not instruments of the devil.&quot;

her husband Steven of U.S. News &amp; World Report, February 28.

they say it. I'm just quoting 'em.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Rather: &quot;Oh, no. I understand. Well, my answer
to that is basically a good Texas phrase, which is bullfeathers....I
think the fact that if someone survives for four or five years
at or near the top in network television, you can just about bet
they are pretty good at keeping independence in their reporting.
What happens is a lot of people don't want independence. They
want the news reported the way they want it for their own special
political agendas or ideological reasons.&quot; -- CNN's Larry

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist,
embarrassed Pat Buchanan today by embracing him as an ideological
soulmate. `Today,' said Zhirinovsky, `there is a presidential
candidate in America who is not afraid to speak the truth, that
truly the Congress of the United States is an occupied territory
of Israel. Your press,' Zhirinovsky went on, `is occupied, and
all of your finances. Americans don't manage those. Israel does,
through American Jews or Negroes.' The Buchanan campaign immediately
issued a message of rejection to Zhirinovsky. It's not that Buchanan
hasn't expressed some of the views that Zhirinovsky echoed, but
perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they sounded until he heard
them in the mouth of a genuine bigot.&quot; -- Ted Koppel concluding
a February 23 Nightline profile of Buchanan.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;But he is worse than oblivious to the political
sewage. It is the medium he has chosen to swim in. Sometimes this
evil nonsense takes the form of language....In waging the culture
wars, he introduces a hateful ethnic dimension. Almost all the
20th century's horrors (the slaughter of the Armenians, Stalin's
starvation of the Ukrainian kulaks, the Hitler Holocaust) have
begun with a demonization of others. Buchanan has a genius for
techniques that bundle his enemies together and subtly satanize
them.&quot; -- Time essayist Lance Morrow on Buchanan, March 4.

The problem is with their employers who have chosen to abandon
their public responsibility in favor of stockholders' demands
for maximization of profit. Adequate profits clearly are necessary
for survival -- but stockholder greed demands superprofits. The
investment in a public service essential to the successful working
of our democracy is required to pay off like an investment in
the rest of the stock market. To play the downsizing game, the
boards and their executives deny to their news managers enough
funding to pay for the minimum coverage necessary to serve their
consumers well....A more responsible press depends not upon individual
journalists but upon more responsible owners. That is the bottom
line.&quot; -- Letter to Newsweek from Walter Cronkite which appeared

<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Eric Engberg's Story<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CBS reporter Eric Engberg: &quot;Steve Forbes pitches
his flat tax scheme as an economic elixir good for everything
that ails us....It's the kind of optimistic message people want
to believe. But experts have trouble with many of Forbes' specific
promises, like how the flat tax would boost economic growth.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Steve Forbes: &quot;By removing obstacles, starting
with the tax code, we are capable of growing at twice that rate.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;Time out! Economists say nothing like
that has ever actually happened...Forbes claims taxes can be lowered
without adding to the deficit....That was called supply-side economics
under President Reagan, less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't
work out that way. Is it fair to say the last time we tried something
like this we ended up with these hideous deficits?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>William Gale, Brookings Institution: &quot;It's perfectly
fair to say that, yes.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;And that if we try it again, your
fear is?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gale: &quot;That we end up with the same problem
again.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;....Okay, how about Forbes' number
one wackiest flat tax promise?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes: &quot;Parents would have more time to spend
with their children, and with each other.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Former IRS commissioner Donald Alexander: &quot;That's
right. The sky would be blue all the time.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Engberg: &quot;The fact is, the flat tax is one giant
untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting
it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania. Eric
Engberg, CBS News, Washington.&quot; -- February 8 CBS Evening
News.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Goldberg Reacts<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;There are lots of reasons fewer people are
watching network news, and one of them, I'm more convinced than
ever, is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good
reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth
discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and
plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't
have to. It comes naturally to most reporters.....Mr. Engberg's
report set new standards for bias....Can you imagine, in your
wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's
health care plan `wacky?'..</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`Reality Check' suggests the viewers are going
to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr.
Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of
getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania.&quot; -- CBS
reporter Bernard Goldberg in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, February
13.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! Circle the Wagons! We're Blind to Bias!
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I've never regarded myself as an ideological
warrior of any kind. It's too hard to get the facts straight and
also have an agenda on my plate.&quot; -- Engberg quoted in USA
Today, February 14.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>His [Engberg's] hallmarks have always been fairness
and accuracy.&quot; -- Dan Rather, quoted in the February 14 New
York Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;People are just stunned. It's such a wacky
charge, and a weird way to go about it....I don't know what Bernie
was driving at. It just sounds bizarre.&quot; -- CBS News Chief
Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer quoted by Howard Kurtz
in the February 15 Washington Post.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd.&quot;
-- CBS News President Andrew Heyward, quoted by Gail Shister in
the February 15 Philadelphia Inquirer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;What is liberal bias? See again, when you use
this blunderbuss criticism, I back off. If you want to be specific
and say Brokaw did a piece that was obviously biased and not balanced,
fine. Or I did a piece, or you did a piece, or you wrote a piece.
But just to spray everybody, I disagree with that. Be specific.&quot;

we've got to do something about this'....There's no suggestion
that he has done that. He has simply stabbed this guy in the back.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>Time Out! CBS Expert Corrects Engberg<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well, and the fact of the matter is yes, we
did balloon the deficit with the Reagan tax cuts, not because
of the tax cuts -- we doubled revenue....Congress went along and
said, `Yeah, let's spend it all, and let's spend more than what
we're taking in.'  If we do the same thing under a flat tax scenario,
yes, we're gonna have a huge deficit. But if we rein in the spending,
we won't.&quot; -- CBS This Morning financial expert Daria Dolan,
February 13.<BR>

never run before. But a McDonald's visit trying to show he is
a regular Joe can't conceal the fact that this regular Joe has
spent more on dirty-tricks negative ads than any other politician
in history.&quot; -- Eric Engberg in the CBS News New Hampshire

<FONT SIZE=2>It Runs in the Family<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Bill Clinton has not done everything right,
but at least he cares for the common man. And tries to help everyone,
not just the chosen rich and big business who support the conservative
point of view. Anyone who would use a sticker `Hail to Rush Limbaugh'
shows me an incredible lack of intelligence and understanding
of what needs to be done.&quot; -- NBC Sports anchor Greg Gumbel

Andrew Carnegie and 19th century industrialism, I explored a period
of greed, of rapidly growing wealth inequality, of painful structural
changes in the economy, or a frustrated labor movement, and of
unethical business dealings born from an absence of regulation.
I found it surprisingly good preparation for my next project,
a documentary about the Reagan years.&quot; -- Josh Clark, associate
producer for documentaries, WGBH-TV in Boston, in the January/February
1996 Mother Jones.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Newsweek's Idea of an Investigative Reporter<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;`She's [Sarah McClendon] a real treasure for
journalism in this city,' says investigative reporter Robert Parry,
a former staffer with the Associated Press and Newsweek, now freelance.
`There was a time in journalism when journalists took pride in
being individuals instead of being members of the pack.' A disgruntled
loner, Parry is a perfect speaker for tonight's meeting. His topic
is the `October Surprise,' a much probed but never proved tangle
of allegations involving top CIA officials and monied Republicans
who supposedly schemed to sabotage an October 1980 release of
the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran, thereby putting the kibosh on President
Carter's re-election. Parry talks spellbindingly for two hours
about a House committee's classified `X-files,' which he stumbled
upon in `a converted ladies' room, with the tampon dispenser still
on the wall': the Hashemi brothers...BCCI links...a $20 million
deposit...David Rockefeller...the Shah's twin sister...a Marcos
bagman. McClendon appears to doze off during parts of the presentation,
then pipes up with such on-point questions as: `Was there any
sort of French intelligence input in those [classified] papers?'&quot;

McClendon, Jan. 24.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Hillary's Tough Media Scrutiny<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You also quote a letter in [It Takes a Village]
that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was
in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there
is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal
triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You
clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you
going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You think government should do a lot more than
it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things
for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government.
How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's
kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government
needs to be more involved?&quot; -- Questions to Hillary Rodham
Clinton from Today substitute co-host Maria Shriver (who called
the book &quot;really terrific&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;),
January 16.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I think it's been a pretty good week for Mrs.
Clinton. I think that a lot of people even listening to the program
so much today keep saying `What's the crime? What did she do so
wrong?' It's a little bit like the budget. Mr. Clinton's protecting
us and everybody is against him. I think there is beginning to
be the feeling of she's being harassed too much.&quot; -- Barbara
Walters on This Week with David Brinkley, January 14.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Forbes Annoys the Media<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Well it helps to know this about a flat tax.
It's a very radical notion and it's not nearly so simple as it
sounds and politicians are very careful not to put all the ramifications
on the table. But here are some of the basics....It is supposed
to encourage savings and investment because profits would be tax
free. But will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats?....Certainly
the rich would do better than the middle class....Here is something
else that worries almost everyone. You see no Western country
has ever tried to make such a seismic shift. How big will a flat
tax need to be to raise the money which the government needs to
run the country?&quot; -- ABC News anchor Peter Jennings on the
January 15 World News Tonight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Steve, isn't this a souped-up version of the
same kind of trickle-down Reaganomics that we saw through already?
Lower taxes were supposed to spur growth. Instead we got record
deficits.&quot; -- Bryant Gumbel to Republican presidential candidate
Steve Forbes, January 18 Today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;[Forbes] paints a vision of wealthy investors
shifting their money out of T-bills and into new factories and
investments. It may not have worked that way in the 1980s, when
top tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's
the reason supply-siders are often described as optimists.&quot;
-- Time Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame, January 29 issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;You may recall that Ronald Reagan, on whom
Forbes models himself, said his tax cuts would balance the budget.
Instead, they helped add trillions to the national debt.&quot;

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;More than half the GOP freshmen have never
held elective office before, and critics say their newness to

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Boston Globe reporter John Koch: &quot;What's your
view of the lack of universal health care in this country?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ABC reporter Dr. Timothy Johnson: &quot;Morally,
it is outrageous that the wealthiest country in the world cannot
provide at least basic care for all of its citizens, when so many
other industrialized countries have accomplished just that. Economically,
it's outrageous, because in fact we still do take care of people
outside the insurance or managed-care systems; but because we
take care of them at a later state, when they're sicker, we pay
more, and it's more difficult to effectively treat them. There
is no argument for anything but universal health care.&quot; --
January 14 Boston Globe Magazine interview.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Time Should Control America's Thinking<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Time magazine, to use that lingo, can be your
intelligent agent. It can also help set the agenda, so that we,
in a time when everything is fractured, 500 channels, you know,
hundreds of thousands of places to go on the World Wide Web, what
we do need in this country, and maybe in this world, is common
ground.... What I think Time magazine should be looking for is
the right tone, a set of core beliefs, and set of core values,
and I think that those are based on sort of a sensible American
common ground; an approach where we ask certain basic values we
all share like what's good for the kids? You know, clean up after
ourselves, certain faith in free minds and free markets and a
certain sense that, whatever the proposal is, the most basic question
we should ask is: yes, but does it work?&quot; -- New Time Managing
Editor Walter Isaacson on the PBS talk show Charlie Rose, January
9.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Joe Klein, Voice of Civil Discourse<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He talks `devolution' to the point of distraction,
trying a bit too hard to stuff some interesting ideas into a dim
populist straitjacket, lobotomizing himself. A more profitable
route might have been to emphasize his low-key style: a calm,
smart, reasonable person in a party that seems mesmerized by its
lunatic fringe.&quot; -- Newsweek Senior Writer Joe Klein on GOP
presidential candidate Lamar Alexander, January 8.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I believe Paula Jones' sister or sister-in-law,
whoever it was, the relative in her family who spoke about Paula

<FONT SIZE=2>Thin-Skinned Phil Lashes Out at Rush<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Limbaugh's draft-avoiding, non-churchgoing,
non-voting, non-fact-checking, painfully insecure triple-wife
lifestyle all are topics delicately touched upon by Franken. Where
I think he really hits the jackpot, though, is when he actually
quotes Limbaugh directly as in: ...`I'm sick and tired of playing
the one phony game I've had to play and that is this so-called
compassion for the poor. I don't have compassion for the poor.'
He may not have cancer, either, and I would pray that he never
have to walk that particular path of pain: Yet who am I to say,
or how can any of us know, the ways of God in unlocking a heart
grown hard? It could happen more gently; I notice a couple of
weeks ago, for instance, they shut down that `Rush Room' at Blackie's
House of Beef. Limbaugh `is fading right now' in popularity among
the restaurant's patrons, according to catering manager Paul DeKoning.
Is this a great country, or what?&quot; -- Washington Post reporter
Phil McCombs (whom Limbaugh ridiculed in 1994) on Saturday Night
Live writer Al Franken's new book Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot

December 29.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Then we're going to look to the continuing
government shutdown. Although some legislators have foolishly
suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite
the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway.
We will show you how some average Americans are suffering every

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Remember, even with a budget deal, the government
would still be nearly $6 trillion in hock in 2002. How will our
children's children ever pay that back? The same way our leaders
tried to enact fiscal discipline back in 1996 -- by short-changing
the poor....Fortunately, both sides remain fierce in their determination
to enact a middle class tax cut. That way, all of us will have
a little more pocket change to dole out to the shivering knots
of beggars on the street.&quot; -- USA Today reporter Walter Shapiro

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;With 4 million to 10 million children scheduled

the economy in the 1996 election.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Under pressure he reverted to the pompous thug
of late-night cable, the backbencher lobbing grenades on C-SPAN
about sick Democrats who were enemies of normal Americans....[Voters
have] learned how far he is willing to go to achieve his larger
goals: shut the government down to make a point with the President;
invite lobbyists not just to lobby, but to draft the laws themselves;
and give a huge tax break to his party's allies at the expense
of services for the poor, with the explanation that this is what
it takes to keep his Republican coalition together.&quot; -- Time

December 25/January 1 Man of the Year cover story on House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;If you look at the polls and look at where
most people in the street are or in any barroom in this country
are saying Bill Clinton seems like a grownup for once and Newt
Gingrich looks like some crazy guy. A car bomber who wants to
blow the country up! With that sort of idiot grin on his face!
And the people look at Newt Gingrich's face on Time magazine this

<FONT SIZE=2>Courage vs. Clueless<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Fortunately the exceptions give us hope --
in this case the Republicans who stood up to the gun lobby and
party pressure to vote their consciences and for their constituents
last week. You can agree or disagree with their position on the
issue, but these 11 Republicans are by definition independent
people with true grit and guts under intense pressure. Exhibit
A is Peter Blute from Worcester....Blute's courage stands in dramatic
contrast to the smarmy move of his GOP colleague, Peter Torkildsen
of the North Shore.&quot; -- Boston Globe Washington columnist
Tom Oliphant in an August 14, 1994 column on Clinton's crime bill
which U.S. Rep. Peter Blute supported and U.S. Rep. Peter Torkildsen
opposed (both Massachusetts Republicans).<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Congressional candidate Jim McGovern, almost
sheepishly, calls it `my applause line.' As one of the Democratic
Party's comeback kids for 1996, McGovern can get a serious rise
out of any collection of the fellow-minded by intoning a truism:
`to dump Newt you have to dump Blute.' That reference is to the
inconsequential incumbent, Peter Blute....The failings of go-alongs
like Blute is not that they are Gingrich clones; it's that there's
no detectable core.&quot; -- Oliphant, December 17, 1995 column.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Read Those Memos<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Globe's Nov. 30 chart explaining where
Weld and Kerry stand on `Medicare cuts' prompted complaints that
the word `cuts' buys into Democratic budget propaganda. They've
got a point, which is why [national editor Jim] Concannon recently
sent out a memo endorsing the phrase `slow the rate of growth'
instead of `cuts.' Yeah, it's a little awkward. But it's one way
-- among many -- that the Globe can do its part to prevent the
rumbling guns of political warfare from demolishing the barrier
between rhetoric and reality.&quot; -- Boston Globe Ombudsman

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The loss of influence couldn't come at a worse
time, since many [Congressional Black] Caucus members represent

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;He invokes the logic of supply side economics:
cuts in the tax rate would lead to stunning growth in the economy
that would, in turn, lead to increased tax collections....But
many economists, including many conservative economists, are skeptical

supply side thinking was put to the test during the Reagan presidency,
revenues declined and staggering deficits were produced.&quot;

Now respectfully, when you start talking about a liberal agenda
and all the, quote, liberal bias in the media, I quite frankly,

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We're all deficit hawks here. Let's scrap the

we have to take so much more spinach in as a result of these tax

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Is it too much to ask this: That both sides
spare us those declarations about how the government must start
operating like a family with a financial problem. Because what
family, with more bills to pay than money to pay them...would
say, `Even though we have to cut back, let's take what money we
can scrape together now and give ourselves a big gift.' But that's
exactly what both sides are saying when they propose a major tax

-- a very vicious campaign. All of those chickens are coming home
to roost, and I don't know whether she was blinded by love or
by ambition, she saw that money coming and she said `Come right
in here'....She's either a greedy fool or a stupid fool, but people
don't want their Congressperson to be either one.&quot; -- Time

<center><h2> December 4, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 25)</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Gergen: Working Both Sides</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Congress now seems intent on imposing new burdens upon the poor, the elderly, and vulnerable children while, incredibly, delivering a windfall for the wealthy....This assault doesn't even count the $270 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare that is frightening senior citizens and could further squeeze public hospitals." -- U.S. News Editor-at-Large David Gergen, November 13 back page column.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"The Democrats were soon up to old tricks, splattering the GOP plan with charges of gutting Medicare, student loans and environmental protections -- charges wildly overstating the facts -- and public opposition rapidly mounted." -- Gergen's next U.S. News & World Report column, two weeks later.
<p>
No, There Are Simply Too Many TV Reporters with Bizarre Theories
<p>
<dd>"This year there's a Grinch: more layoffs in recent weeks by large corporations...And that fear could keep many from spending this year. Worse, there simply are too many stores and, says one expert, this season's holiday spending may not bail out the losers." -- Reporter Ray Brady, November 24 CBS Evening News.
<p>
<dd>"Though some VA and Social Security workers will return next week, the backlog of cases will be tremendous, and in the rest of government, problems are worsening. Imported Christmas toys, which could be unsafe, are not being examined by safety inspectors." -- Reporter Linda Douglass on the federal shutdown, November 16 CBS Evening News. 
<p>
Heard of Bob Dole? Lamar Alexander?
<p>
<dd>"Republican moderates may have reason to feel more threatened than turkeys on this Thanksgiving. With Arlen Specter's out-of-money exit from the '96 White House race, they have no presidential candidate to call their own." -- Judy Woodruff on CNN's Inside Politics, November 23. 
<p>
Bias, on CBS? You Can't Be Serious
<p>
<dd>David Gold, Dallas radio talk show host: "It's you folks in the media. Your bias toward the President and towards the liberals has been palpable, and it's understandable."<br>
CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn: "I don't know where you see that manifested. Certainly not on the CBS network news. I don't think you can indict us all on several bad reports..."<br>
Gold: "I'll give you an example. If you tell people, as Paula did, that Republicans are in quotes, `slashing' $270 billion dollars from Medicare."<br>
Zahn: "Did I just say that?" -- Exchange on CBS This Morning<M>, November 17.<br>
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- Zahn, September 28 CBS This Morning.
<p>
Eleanor "Squeaky Fromme" Clift
<p>
Michael Duffy, Time: "I think Dole will probably be more moderate."<br>
Mara Liasson, NPR: "Especially now that Newt Gingrich has become the poster child for Republican extremism." -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, November 12.
<p>
<dd>"Newt Gingrich teaching manners is like Charles Manson teaching nonviolence." -- Newsweek contributor Eleanor Clift, November 18 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
President Energizer Bunny
<p>
<dd>"As far as I'll go describing Bill Clinton is he's perhaps the most intellectually and physically active person to have held the job in decades. I've also said that if Americans were paying Presidents by the thought, we're getting a bargain in this guy because, my God, he's just always moving, his brain's moving, he hardly sleeps." -- NBC White House reporter Brian Williams, November 17 CBS Late Late Show with Tom Snyder.
<p>
Please Name One Actual Cut
<p>
"With the Republican Congress moving to slash many federal social programs, an odd hush has fallen over Washington: the sound of liberal advocacy groups that have been unable to create much of a clamor against the most drastic cuts in decades." -- Lead of November 24 page 1 New York Times story by Tamar Lewin.
<p>
"The real problem: Many GOP conservatives are determined to slash federal spending to the bone, even if those cuts aren't needed to balance he budget." -- USA Today reporter Bill Montague, November 17 news story.
<p>
<dd>"Republican policies in the age of Gingrich are not just mean, they are vicious. With its unconscionable welfare, Medicare and Medicaid policies, the Grand Old Party is gleefully shredding the income and health safety nets for the young, the poor, the elderly and the disabled." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, in his November 10 New York Times column.
<p>
Unbalanced Views of a Balanced Budget
<p>
<dd>"Let me make just one point. I'm for a balanced budget, too, but in American history, every time we've had a major, real drive to balance the budget it has been followed by a huge depression, economic depression." -- NPR reporter Nina Totenberg on Inside Washington, November 18.
<p>
<dd>"The evidence is quite clear that the 1994 vote was more a negative verdict on the Democrats' failures than the result of some sharp ideological turn in the public. It's true, of course, that the Bolsheviks were willing to launch a revolution without even having a majority. But whatever one thought was wrong with the Republicans, nobody lost sleep at night worrying that they were Leninists. Maybe that was a mistake. As soon as he won his historic but far from overwhelming majority, Newt Gingrich began talking `revolution' and never stopped. His biggest revolutionary move was the balanced budget, which was built on ideas that were not discussed at all in 1994." -- Former New York Times and Washington Post reporter E.J. Dionne, November 14 Washington Post column.
<p>
Will Colin Save That Harsh Fringe Party?
<p>
<dd>"How hard a blow is this to the Republican Party? Has it, as Stephen Ambrose has suggested, left the party to those on the fringe right who all the hopefuls seem anxious to dance to?" -- Bryant Gumbel to reporter Gwen Ifill on Powell's decision not to run for President, November 9 Today.
<p>
<dd>"I think whoever the Republican nominee is will have to work very hard to have Colin Powell actively campaigning for him. And I think also Colin Powell will exact a price for that -- in terms of language, efforts to reach out to minorities, and an effort to make the Republican agenda appear a little less harsh to those who are poor and the working poor." -- NBC News reporter Lisa Myers, same segment.
<p>
Sam's Late Night Dreams of Powell 
<p>
<dd>Sam Donaldson: "I think he's still in it. Let me tell you the plan. It's next summer. Bob Dole looks like the nominee, but people are still grumbling and he's ten points behind in the polls. One morning at dawn we rush in the house, we kidnap Alma, we tie her up, we put tape over her mouth so she can't shout no, and we call him up. We say, `General, your wife is being held in a cavernous auditorium in San Diego.' He rushes there like a good husband. He runs through the curtains -- it's the Republican convention. They see him. They unanimously nominate him. Now he can't refuse, and so he's the nominee. You like that story?"
David Letterman: "Apparently, the sodium pentothal has not worn off, Sam." -- Late Show with David Letterman, November. 28.

<center><h2> November 20, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 24)</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Pouting Over Powell</h3>
<p>
<dd>"But what might have been is what is so intriguing: shrink the safety net, he was saying, but look out for the children. Cut the programs, but don't shut out the people at the bottom.... Abortion, no. But protect the bearer of the child and allow that person to decide. It was the glimpse of these views from someone speaking from inside the Republican Party that might have made for change in American politics. For the last generation, the Republicans have moved even further to the right. Here with candor and some skill, it was a political figure willing to move it back toward the center. That is what made today's announcement so bittersweet." -- ABC reporter John Martin on Colin Powell's decision, Nov. 8 Peter Jennings' Journal on radio.
<p>
<dd>"Most of them [Washington reporters] are centrists. They're not liberals, they're sane centrists, and Powell appealed to the image of why they think they got into politics -- journalism, to begin with....a lot of my colleagues are trying to accept the fact that the Republican Party has the upper hand, and they want a Republican Party they can live with, and Powell is a guy they could live with." <M>-- Newsweek<M> Washington reporter Howard Fineman on CNBC's Equal Time<M>, November 8.<D>
<p>
<dd>"Republicans...are, with calculation, risking blame for shutting down the government next week, or for the United States' defaulting on its debt soon after. In the process they may project an extreme, uncompromising image, the sort that contributed heavily to this week's election setbacks. Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a presidential campaign by Gen. Colin L. Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won." <br>
-- New York Times Washington reporter Adam Clymer, November 11 "news analysis." 
<p>
<dd>"I feel as if this is The Bridges of Fairfax County, and I'm Francesca. The graceful, hard male animal who did nothing overtly to dominate us yet dominated us completely, in the exact way we wanted that to happen at this moment, like a fine leopard on the veld, was gone....`Don't leave, Colin Powell,' I could hear myself crying from somewhere inside....Bummer. We were this close to something interesting and real, and it slipped away." <br>
-- Former New York Times White House reporter Maureen Dowd, November 9 column.
<p>
<h3>Klein, Heal Thyself</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Colin's crusade should be to rescue America from its poisoned political atmosphere....You have a great opportunity to recivilize the public square. Your mission should be to alleviate this awful screeching." <br>-- Newsweek Senior Writer Joe Klein on what he'd tell Colin Powell, November 13 issue. 
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"If he decided to run as a Republican, we'd all have to prepare for the unavoidable, stomach-turning moment when the general made himself available for a photo op with the oleaginous tele-quack Pat Robertson....[Gingrich] misread the public disgust with the tired, corrupt Democratic Congress as support for a `revolution' that abandons the poor while protecting gun nuts and polluters." <br>
-- Klein, same article.
<p>
<h3>Setting Up the Answer</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Do you agree or disagree that the Republicans in Congress are going too far in cutting back government programs?" <br>
-- Question in a Time/CNN poll, November 20 Time.
<p>
<dd>"First, the budget, passed by the Republican Congress, the biggest cuts in the shortest time in memory. According to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out today, almost three-quarters of those asked prefer a budget balancing plan that takes longer, but cuts less from Medicare and education. That's what the President wants. Sixty-one percent think that the President should veto this Republican budget as it now stands." <br>
-- Tom Brokaw, Nov. 1 Nightly News. Spending overall and on Medicare will rise faster than inflation.
<p>
<h3>Brutal and Deep Six Percent Annual Hikes</h3>
<p>
<dd>"White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said Clinton would veto the GOP Medicare proposals. That tough talk suggests the battle for Medicare may be the one that casts Clinton in the role his pollsters ache to see -- as the hero in the way of a brutal Republican juggernaut." <br>
-- Time Senior Writer John Greenwald, Oct. 16.
<p>
<dd>"The most important issue in the fight, which is sometimes lost amid all the talk of train wrecks and debt ceilings, is whether the Republican budget cuts will needlessly hurt the poor and the working class and thereby deepen divisions in an already polarized economy." <br>
-- Greenwald, October 30.
<p>
<h3>Conservatives to Blacks: Drop Dead</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think they're hearing the worst possible message out of Washington right now. I think they're hearing a message of harshness far beyond any rationality that they can see in the figures and the numbers that are coming out of there and the intentions that are coming out of there." 
<br>-- Former CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite on the message blacks are getting from the GOP Congress. CNBC's Tim Russert, Nov. 13.
<p>
<h3>Today's Top News: A Democratic Press Release</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Half of the program reductions included in the budget packages would fall on the poorest fifth of American families, according to projections by the Democratic staff of Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Another 25 percent of the changes would be felt by the next poorest fifth of the population. At the same time, the richest 5 percent of the population would benefit from tax breaks that, on average, are almost as large as the reductions in income and health benefits facing families with children, according to a separate analysis by the Office of Management and Budget....The immediate result, however, is likely to be an increase in the average rate of poverty nationwide and harder times for many families and individuals. Clinton Administration officials and independent budget analysts contend." <br>
-- Front page story by Los Angeles Times reporter Elizabeth Shogren, October 29.
<p>
<h3>Communists and Liberal Republicans: The Same </h3>
<p>
<dd>"The book is, however, a testament to the deep affinity between the two dominant conservative leaders of their time: Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev. At the height of Watergate, Dobrynin delivered a secret message from Brezhnev, urging Nixon to tough it out. When Nixon resigned one step ahead of the law, Brezhnev sent a generous, secret tribute. Brezhnev later demonstrated his conservative consistency by urging Gerald Ford to run for a full term as President." <br>
-- Boston Globe reporter and former Moscow Bureau Chief Paul Quinn-Judge reviewing Anatoly Dobrynin's memoir In Confidence, October 19 Globe.
<p>
<h3>So Much for Unique Political Analysis on PBS</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Well, will they get the blame for killing programs that help people? I mean, we've been talking about politics a lot, we're talking about size and shape and politics, but how about the issues that are involved? Won't Democrats get any credit for trying to save Medicare and other policies that help people?" <br>
-- Associated Press reporter Barry Schweid on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 27.
<p>
"The flat tax is a great one-liner but when you get behind the one line and look at it, it has some problems, the biggest of which is that it amounts to a huge tax cut for people with high incomes...and amounts to a tax increase for a lot of people who are in the middle, middle-income types." <br>
-- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray on the new PBS series Challengers '96, same night.
<p>
<h3>Abortion: Just as Bad as Eating Meat</h3>
<p>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?" <br>-- PBS To the Contrary host Bonnie Erbe discussing partial-birth abortions, November 3. 
<p>
-- L. Brent Bozell III, Publisher; Brent H. Baker, Tim Graham; Editors<br>
-- Geoffrey Dickens, James Forbes, Steve Kaminski, Gesele Rey, Clay Waters; Media Analysts<br>
-- Kathleen Ruff, Circulation Manager; Gene Eliasen, Intern<br>
<p>
<p>
<dd>"The assault on Medicare and Medicaid is, purely and simply, a naked grab for hundreds of billions of dollars earmarked for the care of people unfortunate enough to have fallen ill....As the dollars begin to disappear, various money-losing services will go with them. Clinics will close. Research and teaching will be cut back. Access to physician care in general will be reduced. Growth is anticipated only in the areas of suffering and mortality." <br>
-- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, October 27 New York Times column.
<p>
<dd>"Republicans have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution, killing regulations simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson in an essay titled "Back to the Dark Ages," October 30.
<p>
<dd>"With Rockefeller Republicans like Powell on one side and the far right on the other, the GOP is wondering: whose party is it, anyway?" <br>
--  Newsweek headline, November 13.
<p>
<dd>"In the 1980s President Reagan made the same mistake. He promised that huge tax cuts would accelerate business activity and eliminate the budget deficit. Instead the economy stumbled, and the deficit rose to its highest level in history. Lucas' recommendation to policymakers: stop trying to fine-tune the economy." -- Unbylined story in Time, October 23. 
<p>

<dd>"Carver, who carries his Constitution in his shirt pocket even while baling hay, is a product of the same antifederalist ferment that produced such widely divergent events as the Oklahoma City bombing and Ross Perot's recent proposal to launch a new political party." <br>
-- Time  Erik Larson, October 23 issue.
<p>


<dd>"Republicans may have entered the slaphappy phase of their revolution simply because they can. Indeed, the nursing-home industry has not even asked for regulatory relief, in part because it would allow unscrupulous operators to flourish and bring shame on all of them. But Speaker Gingrich is hurtling along, fearless about sending Mom and Dad back to the future, to the day of nursing homes that lack nurses and feel nothing like home." <br>
-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, October 30 issue.
<p>
<dd>"For instance, projected Medicare costs will rise over the next seven years by ten point five percent a year if left alone...the Republicans would reduce that increase to six point four percent a year. But that's still an increase, says Gingrich, not a cut.
<p>
<dd>Well, I got to thinking about that and I must tell you I think Gingrich is wrong. Take a family of four. Suppose that family earns enough to buy a loaf of bread each day and everyone gets a fourth of the loaf. That loaf costs a dollar. Now, I know it really costs more, but let's just keep this simple.
<p>
<dd>Suddenly, mama gives birth to another child. It is now a family of five and the head of the house comes to Mr. Gingrich and says, "I'll need another quarter please to buy another quarter loaf of bread."
<p>
<dd>And Mr. Gingrich says, "No, sorry. I'll give you another twelve and a half cents. But not a penny more. I suspect that family will think it's just suffered a cut. No longer can everyone have a quarter loaf of bread a day...now everyone has to have less. Even though Mr. Gingrich will say, "Why, that family got an increase in its budget."
<p>
<dd>Now, any way you slice it, the Republicans are cutting the budget. Perhaps a good thing. Who needs a quarter loaf of bread a day anyway?" -- ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, October 31 Peter Jennings' Journal.
<p>

<dd> Ironically, that is the image that might have been mitigated in a Presidential campaign by Gen. Colin Powell, for he would have forced their campaign dialogue away from pleasing the right and toward the political middle, where elections are won. But the retired Army general announced on Wednesday that he would not run next year." <br>
-- New York Times columnist Adam Clymer, November 10 edition.
<p>

<dd>"Ms. Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund and she is outraged by the Republican-led assault on the poor and the young and the sick and the disabled." <br>
-- New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, November 6 "In America" column.
<p>
<dd>"What is more important is that the Federal Government is abandoning its responsibility to provide eveen the most minimal level of assistance to Americans left without any other resources.
That is a radical and deeply regrettable change at the core of the American value system." <br>
-- Herbert, same column.
<p>

<dd>"Let me hog the lectern for the moment and say that you expect the three far-right justices, Scalia, Rehnquist, and Thomas, to vote to uphold this constitutional amendment. You expect the moderate left, because there is no hard left anymore on this court, but the moderate left -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Souter, and it's slipping my mind, Stevens, to vote to throw it out." <br>
-- Mutual/NBC radio reporter Bonnie Erbe hosting the PBS show To the Contray, October 13.
<p>
<h3>Words Never Used for the Million Man March</h3>
<p>
"From fewer than 100 followers four years ago, the ranks of this macho religious revival group have exploded, today numbering 700,000 zealots." <br>
-- CBS reporter Frank Currier on the Christian men's group Promise Keepers, October 18.
<p>

<h3>Republicans Hate Old People</h3>
<p>
"O'Rourke allies himself with the privileged. His heartless mockery of the less fortunate makes him the perfect jester for the court of Newt Gingrich." <br>
-- Los Angeles Times book critic Charles Solomon reviewing P.J. O'Rourke's All the Trouble in the World, October 8.
<p>
<h3>Clarence Thomas </h3>
<p>
"But don't expect an end to juries here [in the U.S.]. That would require an outright repeal of the Sixth Amendment -- not likely even in the archconservative era symbolized by Justice Clarence Thomas." <br>
-- Newsweek David A. Kaplan, October 16.

"Can prime time support two successful hospital shows? Absolutely. As Newt Gingrich and company stir up national anxieties about the future of medical care, viewers are very much in the mood for watching tales of crisis and stabilization." <br>
-- New York Times TV critic John J. O'Connor, November 6.

<p>
<h3>Will the Lies Ever Stop?</h3>
<p>
"And on a busy Saturday this morning, Jack, we're going to get to the very latest on Republicans' plan to slash the Medicare budget." -- Today co-host Giselle Fernandez to co-host Jack Ford, October 14.
<p>
"Republicans are predicting victory today when their plan to overhaul Medicare is put to a vote in the House. Last night, Democrats were still attacking the bill, which slashes $270 billion in Medicare spending." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 19.
<p>
"Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?" -- Tom Brokaw to Tim Russert, October 19 NBC Nightly News.
<p>
"The House and Senate begin debate today on the Republican plan to balance the budget. It would slash spending by a quarter-trillion dollars, which Democrats claim would fund a tax cut for the rich." -- CBS This Morning news anchor Jane Robelot, October 25.
<p>
"If enacted it would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor....It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government." -- Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray, October 26 NBC News at Sunrise.
<p>
"Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and too extreme." -- Dan Rather, October 25 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor...For
weeks, Democrats have hammered Republicans for seeking large cuts in Medicare and other social programs to help offset the cost of their tax cut for middle- and upper-income Americans." -- Washington Post reporters John E. Yang and Eric Pianin, October 27 front page story.
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"An illuminating way to look at this budget is to take what the government actually spent and raised over the past seven years and compare it to what Republicans propose to spend and raise over the next seven years. The results: Spending will increase by $2.6 trillion. Revenues will increase by $3.3 trillion....Spending will rise by 27 percent and tax revenues by 41 percent....Consider Medicare. Politicians talk about $271 billion in cuts, but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than in 1995, an increase of more than 6 percent annually." -- Washington Post <M>columnist James K. Glassman, October 17.
<p>
<h3>Weren't Southern Segregationists All Democrats?</h3>
<p>
"Mr. Clinton has sought to keep blacks involved by standing up for at least some affirmative action programs, which is highly unpopular with many white voters. But he must also respond, to some degree, to the national passion for shrinking government, which will inevitably involve reductions in federal programs that poor blacks regard as lifelines, like Medicaid and urban subsidies. Mr. Clinton can only hope that his party is not punished further for its longstanding commitment to (and identification with) the blacks of America." -- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief R.W. Apple, October 17 "news analysis."
<p>
"They were there to remind Americans that even in a time of conservatism and backlash, the business of racism and inequality will not be ignored." -- Time's Richard Lacayo on the Million Man March, Oct. 30.
<p>
<h3>I Won't Condemn Louis Farrakhan, But Bob Dole Is Sickening</h3>
<p>
"I think he [Farrakhan] has begun to rehabilitate himself. I don't know that it will ever be complete. I think he said so many vile things. I don't think we can ever erase that. But if somebody is going to do something decent and encourage the kind of expression of solidarity we saw today, I'm not going to condemn it. I think it was a positive march." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, CBS's Late Late Show with Tom Snyder, Oct. 17.
<p>
"He's [Dole's] a raging moderate in his heart. But the things he's doing now to pander to the right wing of the party are sickening." -- Clift, minutes later.
<p>
<h3>Is There Any Doubt?</h3>
<p>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is still being treated as if he were guilty." -- Bryant Gumbel, October 16 Today.
<p>
<h3>Reporters Aren't Liberal, They're Just Compassionate</h3>
<p>
Cokie Roberts: "I don't think the coverage of Gingrich and the GOP Congress has been liberally biased..."
Lisa Myers: "I also think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal vs. conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending money to try to solve problems. And it's compassionate to spend money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation." -- The ABC and NBC reporter on CNBC's Meet the Media, Oct. 23.
<p>
<h3>From the Conservatives You've Ignored</h3>
<p>
"This is a pretty big complicated idea and you're looking at a real bedrock program [Medicare] here. How come we haven't heard about this before? Where did this Medical Savings Account come from?" -- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus, October 20 Washington Week in Review.
<p>
<h3>Helping Clinton's Triangulation</h3>
<p>
"How do you view the GOP's courtship of the extreme and religious right?" -- Bryant Gumbel to former Democratic Senator Gary Hart, October 17 Today.
<p>
"There's a hollowness to the U.S. economy and -- as the President explained aboard Air Force One -- to the American spirit in this post-Cold War era. Doubt and fear leave people vulnerable to the seductive voice of extremists, he said, drawing votes from centrists like himself." -- Boston Globe reporter John Aloysius Farrell, September 22.
<p>
<h3>Bill the Terrific and the Fabulous Democrats</h3>
<p>
"It's nice, of course, if we have a President we like. But there's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific." -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, October 17.
<p>
"With eight retiring Senators, Sam Nunn being the latest, I think there's a lot of concern that this party is looking very hard to find its voice and find a clear vision for the fabulous record of things that it's done for this country, and hopefully that will come up in your next segment with Gary Hart." -- U.S. News Director of Editorial Administration (and 1984 Hart press secretary) Kathryn Bushkin, C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, Oct. 15.
<p>
<h3>Saw Off That Tongue</h3>
<p>
Tim Russert: "You're encouraging the President today in saying `Let the Democrats in Congress negotiate.' Are you not concerned that if you cut a deal with Republicans, President Clinton will saw your limb off?"
Sen. Bob Kerrey: "That's a terrible metaphor, since someone's already sawed one of them off." -- Exchange from the October 29 Meet the Press. (Kerrey lost a leg in the Vietnam War).

<h3>Let's Leave Out the Inconvenient Speeches</h3>
<p>
"Though not without controversy, it's expected to be the biggest rally ever in the nation's capital. Organizers are viewing the march as a peaceful time of atonement for African-American men, a time of reconciliation, a time of personal responsibility, and a time of healing today." -- Bryant Gumbel opening the October 16 Today, the morning of the Million Man March.
<p>
"Responding to a common problem, hundreds of thousands of black men gathered in a peaceful rally of prayer and atonement and were encouraged to go home and make a difference...very peaceful, it was a day of prayer, of song, of atonement, and one hopes of considerable action." -- Gumbel, next morning. 
<p>
"It would be astonishing if this public performance of Farrakhan were to end or even minimize the controversy which he inspires in the country as a whole, but it would be a terrible mistake not to
recognize that here today, he inspired many people, and in a broader sense, as one participant after another has reaffirmed, this day, at this time and this place, really did mean unity over division." -- Peter Jennings ending World News Tonight, October 16.
<p>
"Were you struck by the fact that these hundreds of thousands of men...did not come to the seat of power to ask their government for anything?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Penn.)
<p>
Reality Check:<br>
"Blacks should atone not for our anger, but for not being angry enough at the growing racism and incipient fascism of white America. We should atone for not developing more political independence, more cultural identity, and more control of our economy, in defiance of white power, in defiance of Jewish
influence....White dreams have crippled many black children and white values have maimed many black families....In the military, we died to save European Jews in the 1940s and South Koreans in the '50s and Vietnamese in the '60s. Yet, since then, all three have taken from our community to enrich their own....We
are an oppressed colony in the most imperialist nation the world has ever known." -- Former U.S. Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.) addressing the march, as shown on C-SPAN.
<p>
"When I grow up, and find a man of my choice, I'll produce like Mary, a man of God's divine race." -- Tiffany Jamille Mayo reading a Maya Angelou poem adapted by Louis Farrakhan, on C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Did Minister Farrakhan organize the march? No, Clarence Thomas and Gingrich organized the march just like Bull Connor organized the march in 1963." -- Jesse Jackson, shown by C-SPAN and CNN.
<p>
"Whereas African black people have been forced to invest vast amounts of labor in the development of U.S. capitalism, but have never received due compensation for slavery....the Virgin Islands shall seriously explore the political status of foreign relations, reparations/repatriation issue within six months of the enactment of the resolution." -- March speaker Adelbert Bryan, shown by C-SPAN.
<p>
"In the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555 feet high. But if we put a one in front of that 555 feet we get 1555, the year that our first fathers landed on the shores of Jamestown Virginia as slaves. In the background, is the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial. Each of these monuments is 19 feet high. Abraham Lincoln is the 16th President, Thomas Jefferson the 3rd President, and 16 and 3 makes 19 again." -- Louis Farrakhan in a portion of his speech shown live by CNN and C-SPAN but not on network news shows.
<p>
<h3>Where's My Hanky?</h3>
<p>
"Before I leave you, a very personal question. How many times have you felt like crying today?" -- CNN's Bernard Shaw to Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Maryland), during October 16 live march coverage.
<p>
<h3>Someone Got Released Too Early</h3>
<p>
"Black men's tension is compounded when we see how many, but by  no means all, white Americans respond with apathy and outright hostility to our distress. The fashionable formula offered by white demagogues for addressing black men's monumental woes -- three-strikes-and-you're-out, mandatory sentencing, and the abolition of parole -- is especially vicious and destructive. As an African-American who's gone the prison route, these sinister measures make me so furious sometimes my vision gets blurred. They make me want to lash out at whites in the basest way." -- Convicted armed robber turned Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, October 15 Outlook section article on why he would join the march.
<p>
<h3>Another Day, Another Round of Media Lies</h3>
<p>
"Republicans began pushing the last and perhaps most controversial elements of their ambitious legislative agenda yesterday, seeking to scale back medical aid for the poor and the elderly."<M> -- Reporter Peter Gosselin in a Boston Globe story headlined "GOP Pushes Health Cuts for the Poor," September 27.
<p>
"[Clinton's] focus on GOP Medicaid cuts followed similar attacks the day before on GOP Medicare cuts in talks to senior citizens in southern Florida." -- Associated Press dispatch in the September 21 Los Angeles Times, headlined "Clinton Sounds Warning on Medicaid Cuts by GOP."
<p>
E.J. Dionne, Washington Post columnist: "No one has talked about the Medicaid cuts, which are if anything much deeper and much more significant...I think that with those kind of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do, as Steve says, a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people." 
Mara Liasson, NPR: "....But you know, the cuts they proposed in Medicaid are huge!" -- Exchange on CNN's Late Edition, October 1. <br>
Reality Check:<br>
"Far from being a `cut,' MediGrant funding represents nearly a 50 percent increase in federal assistance to help the states pay health care costs for the needy over the next seven years....On a per-person basis, MediGrants will increase the average federal grant for each person in poverty from $2,188 in 1994 to $3,263 per person in 2002 -- hardly a `slimmed down grant,' as suggested in Post articles." -- House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley (R-Va.) in an October 11 Washington Post op-ed.
<p>
<h3>Pope's a Cuomo Kind of Guy</h3>
<p>
"Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of proposed laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's
programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of President Clinton's warnings." -- New York Times reporter Robert McFadden, October 5.
<p>
"At times, the Pope even sounded like a Democrat. His heart is clearly with the have-nots. And for that, at least, liberals appreciate his views on peace and social justice and the responsibility of rich nations to the poor....For sure, on sexual morality he is predictably conservative, and he often repeats his boilerplate message against abortion." -- Chicago Tribune reporter Timothy McNulty, October 8. 
<p>
<h3>Very Unifying</h3>
<p>
"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there [marching]." -- Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page on the October 15 McLaughlin Group. 
<p>
<h3>Yes, She Said "Popularity Control"</h3>
<p>
"The Pope's stands on issues such as, for instance, abortion, popularity control, birth control -- is he aware that American Catholic women, the majority, have different views than he does on these matters?" -- Giselle Fernandez to papal envoy Mary Ann Glendon, October 8 Today.

<p>
<h3>No, Ito Didn't Underestimate the White Jurors Either</h3>
<p>
"In his written ruling, Ito said, I'm quoting here, `The court finds the probative value of the remaining examples,' those not allowed, `substantially and overwhelmingly outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.' Do you think Ito has underestimated the intellectual capacity of this jury because it is black-majority?" -- Today co-host Bryant Gumbel to O.J. Simpson lawyer Alan Dershowitz on Judge Ito's ruling that admitted only two of Mark Fuhrman's racial slurs, September 1.
<p>
<h3>Lying More Than Johnnie Cochran</h3>
<p>
"On Close Up this morning, Medicare. Republicans in Congress are beginning to detail how they intend to cut $270 billion from the Medicare budget." -- Bryant Gumbel, September 15 Today.
<p>
"The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital bell ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be." -- Newsweek's Eleanor Clift, September 16 McLaughlin Group.
<p>
"Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut. The question is how much and
for how many." -- Dan Rather, September 20 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Congressional Republicans are trying to squeeze $270 billion out of the program during the next seven years. The Democrats say the proposed cuts are too deep." -- CNN's Bernard Shaw, Sept. 20 Inside Politics.
<p>
"The Republican plan to slash $270 billion from Medicare cleared its first hurdle in a Senate committee vote last night." -- CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn, September 28.
<p>
"Just after midnight the [Senate Finance] committee voted 11 to 9 along party lines to approve an 
anti-deficit plan mandating massive cuts and changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and virtually every federal
welfare program." -- Washington Post reporters Eric Pianin and Judith Havemann, September 30.
<p>
"Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said today Democrats have a plan to save Medicare without raising
premiums or deductibles. He said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of
what the Republicans have proposed to slash." -- PBS anchor Robert MacNeil on The MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour, October 2.
<p>

<h3>Cronkite Tries Spin Control</h3>
<p>
Caller: "You've been quoted as saying that you felt that most journalists were liberal, in fact that a good journalist was by nature a liberal."
Walter Cronkite: "I define liberal as a person who is not doctrinaire. That is a dictionary definition of liberal. That's opposed to `liberal' as part of the political spectrum....open to change, constantly, not committed to any particular creed or doctrine, or whatnot, and in that respect I think that news people should be liberal." -- Exchange on CNN's Larry King Live, September 11.
<p>
Reality Check:
<p>
"I know liberalism isn't dead in this country. It simply has, temporarily we hope, lost its voice....We know that Star Wars means uncontrollable escalation of the arms race. We know that the real threat to democracy is the half of the nation in poverty....We know that no one should tell a woman she has to bear an unwanted child....Gawd Almighty, we've got to shout these truths in which we believe from the housetops. Like that scene in the movie Network, we've got to throw open our windows and shout these truths to the streets and the heavens." -- Cronkite addressing a November 17, 1988 People for the American Way dinner as quoted in the December 5, 1988 Newsweek.
<p>
<h3>No, Colin, Not the Genocidal Republicans!</h3>
<p>
"For urban dwellers, and especially the poor, the Republican Party as currently constituted is the enemy -- the source of endless destructive, mean-spirited and racist initiatives....The unspoken question on Kelly Street [in the Bronx] was how, in good conscience, General Powell could serve as the standard-bearer of a party that is waging all-out war against the poor and racial and ethnic minorities (and which is hostile to the interests of the middle class as well)....For years, the insidious and blatantly racist strategy of the Republican Party has been to pit the middle classes against the lower classes, while sucking money from both groups up the economic pyramid to the smiling faces at the top." -- Former NBC reporter Bob Herbert in his New York Times column, September 22.
<p>
<h3>The Pope's a Crank</h3>
<p>
"There are 60 million Catholics in America, and for many of them he also speaks with the voice of a conservative crank when he stonewalls on abortion, birth control, married priests, women priests and so on." -- Washington Post reporter Henry Allen in an October 2 Style section story.
<p>

<h3>Nothing Dangerous About Abortion</h3>
<p>
"The picture, fed by conservative critics, of a festival of radical feminism where ideas germinated in the West were spread aggressively among wide-eyed disciples from the rest of the world, didn't match the conference that I covered....to those who argue there was a dangerous political agenda at work, that is true only if you believe there is something dangerous about helping 70 percent of the world's poor, who happen to be women." -- CNN anchor Judy Woodruff in a Washington Post op-ed, October 1.
<p>
<h3>Sounds Like Mario Cuomo</h3>
<p>
"Our viewers remember from '80, from 1980 to 1988, Ronald Reagan said he could cut taxes, increase defense, and still balance the budget. The deficit under Ronald Reagan doubled. The debt tripled, and home mortgage rates were 12 percent. It didn't work then. Why would it work now?" -- Meet the Press host Tim Russert to GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes, September 24.
<p>
<h3>For Once We Agree</h3>
<p>
"The Standard is part of the process, whereas George is part of the problem. Why should politics need more packaging when The New Yorker has gone Hollywood, Vanity Fair psycho-babbles, and we've
already got too many television yak shows where Ross Perot flies in one of Larry King's ears and out the other like a maddened fruit bat." -- CBS Sunday Morning television critic John Leonard, September 24.

<h2> September 11, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 19)</h2>
<p>
<h3>Someday, Hawaii Might Become the 50th State</h3>
<p>
"President Clinton will be attending more ceremonies in Hawaii marking V-J Day, Victory over Japan. Saturday, Mr. Clinton went to a ceremony on a hill high above Honolulu. He praised those who served in the military 50 years ago, saying they saved the world. After today's ceremonies marking the end of World War II, President Clinton will head back to the United States." -- NBC anchor Giselle Fernandez, September 3 Today.
<p>
<h3>More Insight From Miss Hawaii</h3>
<p>
"Let's touch on your hard stands against affirmative action. You were Governor during the Los Angeles riots. Many of the people there believed those happen not just because of Rodney King, but because affirmative action didn't trickle down far enough. How do you propose to cure urban problems without bringing some kind of economic equality?" -- NBC anchor Giselle Fernandez to California Governor Pete Wilson, August 27 Today.
<p>
<h3>Meet Clinton's '96 Press Secretary</h3>
<p>
"So perhaps the weekend of World War II commemoration was  somewhat of an epiphany for Clinton, and for the nation. Maybe the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II was a time when he came to the realization that his reluctance to answer his country's call was a mistake, and those who answered without
a second thought forgave him. How else do we explain aging World War II veterans, as giddy as children, jockeying to get their pictures taken with the President, and camouflaged young soldiers with shaven heads shouting out `Four more years!'" -- USA Today reporter Richard Benedetto in Honolulu, September 5.
<p>
<h3>Senator Bill Bradley's A "Moderate"...</h3>
<p>
"Bradley is one of an endangered species in American politics, a true moderate." -- CNN political analyst William Schneider, August 19 Inside Politics, after the New Jersey Democrat said he wouldn't seek re-election.
<p>
"Bradley...he's got the right profile, he's sort of in the middle and he's got integrity." -- Time reporter Laurence Barrett on CNBC's Cal Thomas, August 23.
<p>
"Echoing growing disillusionment in Washington by moderates of both parties -- including Bradley -- [former New Jersey Gov. Thomas] Kean criticized a `lack of civility' and `meanness' in national politics..." -- Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, September 1. (Bradley's 1994 Americans for Democratic Action liberal rating: 85. His 1994 American Conservative Union rating: 4.)
<p>

<h3>...But More Moderate Senator Judd Gregg's A "Radical"?</h3>
<p>
"Gregg-ism (the supine adoption of Gingrich's far-out agenda and Bob Dole's kissin' cousin facsimile) would literally involve the transfer of income and wealth to the occupants of plush homes along the quiet streets of Amherst and Peterborough, straight from the pockets of working and retired families from Salem in the south all the way north to Berlin. From his perch on the budget and human resources committees, Gregg has been a  down-the-line rubber stamp for radicalism; fortunately, serious Republican leaders to his north in Maine, west in Vermont and south in Rhode Island are picking up his slack. The good news is that Gingrich, Gregg, and the radicals are going to lose their fight to transfer income and wealth on this extreme scale." -- Boston Globe Washington columnist and former reporter Tom Oliphant on Gregg (R-NH), August 20. (Gregg's 1994 ADA liberal rating: 15. Gregg's 1994 ACU conservative score: 79.)
<p>
<h3>At Least His Victims Are Alive to Complain</h3>
<p>
"Good evening. Senator Bob Packwood has been one of the Senate's enduring embarrassments since it was disclosed that he had a long history of explicit sexual harassment and fondling, and now his career, his time as a U.S. Senator, apparently is very near an end." -- NBC's Tom Brokaw, September 6 Nightly News.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
Anchor Mary Alice Williams: "It was 20 years ago tonight that a car swerved off a small bridge on Chappadquiddick Island off Massachusetts' coast...NBC's Andrea Mitchell tonight on how Ted Kennedy is winning respect 20 years later."
<p>
Mitchell: "In reforming the immigration law last week, Ted Kennedy was updating the rules he first legislated in 1965. It's that kind of nuts-and-bolts work that has earned the respect of colleagues -- even conservatives." -- NBC Nightly News, July 18, 1989.
<p>
<h3>Harmless Communism and Its Harmful Overthrow</h3>
<p>
"But Vietnam's government is worried about the ugly side of the free market system: crime, unemployment, pollution, and most of all, political dissent." -- NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, August 4 Nightly News.
<p>
"This is how Arbat Street looked then, 150 years ago. None of the buildings still stand -- too much trauma. The end of the czars, a revolution, two World Wars, the fall of communism -- it's all taken a heavy toll on this tired nation." -- NBC reporter Martin Fletcher in Russia, August 27 Today.
<p>
<h3>The "Nonpartisan" Group Seeking to Destroy the Religious Right</h3>
<p>
"Norman Lear, veteran TV and film producer and co-founder of the nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization People for the American Way, has doubts about the merger of Capital Cities/ABC with the Walt Disney Co." -- Unbylined item in Los Angeles Times, August 1.
<p>
<h3>Pat Makes Them Shiver</h3>
<p>
"Pat Buchanan is seen by many in the party as extreme. That's not my word. That's not the Democrats' words. That's the Republicans' words. I was on the floor of the convention in 1992 when Pat Buchanan delivered that speech in which he talked about taking back the country street by street. That sent shivers down the backs of many Republicans at that convention." -- CNN's Frank Sesno on C-SPAN's Sunday Journal, August 20.
<p>

<h3>Deficit of Consistency</h3>
<p>
"Apparently, the Republicans, who tend to govern by slogan, think the meaningless balanced budget and its accompanying tax cuts for the rich are more important than school lunches for the poor. That, of course, is absurd. The administration has proposed a humane bu dget that calls for no new debt by 2004, but the CBO, using less rosy projections, says the deficit would be about $200 billion then. So what? That would be just 1.7 percent of the projected gross domestic product." -- Former NBC News President
Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, September 5.

<p>
"Before you listen to them trash Bill Clinton, before you put a new bumper sticker on your car, look at what happened between 1981 and 1992, the 12 years the White House was controlled by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. The budget deficit in 1980, the year before the Republicans took over, was about $73 billion. By 1992, their last year in office, it has soared to $340 billion (or, if you want to toss in the Social Security surplus, $290 billion). Responsible management? Hardly." -- Gartner in USA Today, April 18.

<center><h2> August 28, 1995 (Vol. Eight; No. 18)</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Failing to Help CBS Democrats</h3>
<p>
"So why not stay in the Senate with your party and restore -- if it's all broken, have you no responsibility to even your Democratic constituents from New Jersey who work right within this building?" -- CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith to Senator Bill Bradley who announced he will not seek re-election, August 17.
<p>
<h3>Gephardt and Daschle: The Media's Middle</h3>
<p>
"The Democrats can offer only a cacophony of views, ranging from the leftist tract of [Jesse] Jackson to the more centrist perspectives of House minority leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate minority leader Tom Daschle." -- Time Washington reporter Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, in an August 14 story on what the parties can offer Perot voters. Gephardt's 1992 American Conservative Union (ACU) rating: 0. Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) rating in 1992: 85 percent. Daschle's 1992 ACU: 22 percent; 1992 ADA: 95.
<p>
<h3>A Massive Six Tenths of One Percent Slash from the Federal Budget</h3>
<p>
"A bitter battle on Capitol Hill has ended with a deep slash in federal spending. The House made more than $9 billion in cuts, hitting education and employment programs especially hard. NBC's Joe Johns has more." -- NBC Today anchor Matt Lauer, August 4.
<p>
<h3>More Concerned About Investigators Than Investigated</h3>
<p>
"The Whitewater scandal occupied key committees in both the House and Senate last week -- a two-ring circus whose single goal seemed to be causing maximum embarrassment to Bill and Hillary Clinton and their friends." -- Opening sentence of August 21 Newsweek story headlined "An End in Sight (Maybe), Whitewater: Trying to finish the investigations." Story written by Mark Hosenball and Michael Isikoff.
<p>
"But these won't be the last ones. The Republicans plan several more rounds, and these hearings left us with more questions than answers about the tangled Whitewater mess and Republicans' motives." -- CNN's Bob Franken concluding an August 11 World News story.
<p>
<h3>White Men Ruin Everything</h3>
<p>
"Why don't we adequately fund urban education at the preschool and elementary level to eliminate the need for race-based admission standards later on?....The uncomfortable truth is that the tension about raceand gender in this country is not about facts; it is about fear. In the '60s and '70s, we settled all this on paper. We desegregated the schools. We admitted women to the Ivy League. We granted women control of their reproductive lives. And in response? White, middle class families abandoned our cities and schools to poor minorities. Universities educated the women they had admitted, then denied them tenure....We thought we had granted women the right to abortion in 1973. But barely a year goes by that the U.S. Supreme Court calendar does not include a case attempting to limit the right to abortion outlined in Roe v. Wade." -- Boston Globe<M> reporter Eileen McNamara in an August 16 front page "commentary." 
<p>
<h3>Internment Camps, Proposition 187: Same Thing</h3>
<p>
"Is it really a comfort to know that Canadians were as disdainful of civil liberties and common sense as the rest of us in our yellow fever?...In California, where I grew up, they're doing it all over again, punishing brown-skinned berry-pickers for the collapse of the aerospace industry and the savings-and-loan
scandals." -- CBS Sunday Morning TV critic John Leonard on a movie about Japanese relocation camps in Canada during World War II, July 30.
<p>
<h3>Abandoned to Crazed Uncles and Big Business</h3>
<p>
"The Republicans say they are for the poor as well as the rich. So how come they want to offer no aid and comfort -- and care -- when the poor are put upon? How come they want to eliminate  federal welfare programs and leave the poor and the sick and the unlucky at the mercy of the states -- some of which don't have a great record of caring for people who don't make political contributions. Why do they want to let states take away aid to provide for abortions in case of rape and incest? So only the rich won't have to bear children of violent strangers or crazed uncles? Do the Republicans perhaps have a double standard
-- not of men and women, but of rich and poor?" -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner in his USA Today column, August 15. 
<p>
"The sordid, cynical effort to pass regulatory `reform' is all about money. The legislation is designed to enhance the profits of big business by tying the regulatory process in knots. Government officials will be virtually neutralized as they are forced to make endless cost-benefit analyses before determining whether to protect Americans from unsafe food or drugs, from dangers in the workplace, from a tainted blood supply, from pollutants in the environment, and on and on." -- Former NBC News reporter Bob Herbert, August 7 New York Times column.
<p>
"You're probably wondering how I'm going to make this segue from Gingrich to Galapagos but the point I was trying to make was that, in the 19th century, after Darwin, you had a movement called, that you know all about, called Social Darwinism, where people applied Darwin's rules of nature to society: survival of the fittest, the strong prosper, the weak don't. I'm wondering, do you, some people think we actually are headed back into Social Darwinism now, a new way of looking at society's responsibilities." -- Question from Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter to ABC's Forrest Sawyer, August 12 CNBC Talk
Live.
<p>
<h3>Never Mind Current Events, Media Can't Get History Straight </h3>
<p>
"The Russians attacked on August 9th; on the 11th the U.S. assured the Japanese that they could keep their Emperor. [Historian Gar] Alperovitz says this assurance could have produced a surrender without the atomic bombs. That is now the prevailing view among U.S. historians." -- NBC reporter Gary Matsumoto, August 6 Today.
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
"Japanese students were still being drafted to prepare for the expected U.S. invasion; boys as young as 12 were being trained to fly Kamikaze suicide missions....Japan's Emperor and civilian leaders had wanted to end the war weeks earlier but feared a military revolt. Then came the atomic bombings. On August 9th
Emperor Hirohito summoned top government officials to the Imperial Palace where he told them the end had come; it was time to accept the unthinkable. Kasotoshi Hondo wrote Japan's definitive history on the last hours of the war. Through a film based on his book many Japanese learned...how the military
attempted a coup d'etat on the 14th of August. Several hundred troops stormed the palace trying to find the recording of the Emperor's surrender announcement." -- ABC's Mark Litke on World News Tonight, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Lionizing Politically Correct Cop Killers</h3>
<p>
"Sympathizers around the globe from Dublin to Soweto hail him as a political prisoner punished for taking journalistic aim at politicians, police and the prison system (most recently in a book entitled Live from Death Row). If he is put to death, they argue, he will be the first American since Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg to be executed for his political beliefs." -- Time Senior Writer Jill Smolowe in August 7 story on battle to save Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer.

<p>
<h3>Republicans Will Kill You</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Safe food, safe water, safe air, safe transportation. You have this protection now, but you might be about to lose it. Why? Watch a special In Depth report on NBC Nightly News tomorrow." -- Promo at the end of NBC Nightly News,<M> July 17.<D>
<p>
<dd>"There will be change, but most hope the original intent of the law will not be lost. Because if the plants and animals can't survive, what future is there for the human species?"<M> -- NBC reporter Roger O'Neil concluding a story on proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, July 28 Nightly News.
<p>
<dd>"This is deregulation madness! We're gonna have dirty water, dirty air. OSHA regulations are being rolled back. There's gonna be no competition in the telecommunications industry. And between local cable and local phone, there's not gonna be competition at the present time. It's gonna take awhile and there's gonna be no regulation in the meantime. And so no, he [Clinton] can't go along with this. And the people, the public isn't going to go along with this. They don't want E. coli bacteria in their drinking water." <M>-- Time<M> columnist Margaret Carlson, August 5 Capital Gang.
<p>
<dd>"The onslaught of political and legislative attacks on programs for the poor and for the young is about to create even bigger problems for America's troubled inner cities. Just yesterday, Congress killed nearly $900 million in funding for summer youth jobs programs, a major blow to disadvantaged inner-city youth and to cities trying to keep young people occupied and out of trouble." <M>-- ABC World News Saturday <M>anchor John Cochran, July 22.
<p>
<h3>Artful Thoughts About Lobotomized Conservatives</h3>
<p>
<dd>"The conservatives' agenda, if it goes through, is going to depress the quality of cultural and educational life for everyone in America, young and old, black, brown, male or female. This is one of the most ill-conceived, profoundly anti-democratic ideas ever to get loose in Congress. Private philanthropy will never be able to restore what seems about to be taken away. Some will not notice it; others won't care; given the shortness of American social memory, perhaps the next generation won't know what happened. Partial lobotomies work that way. They favor Beavis and Butt-head. Is that the business of American government?" <M>-- Time <M>art critic Robert Hughes, concluding August 7 cover story on plans to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.
<p>
<dd>"Welcome to the Hall of Shame, Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio. Chabot this week called the National Endowment for the Humanities a `boondoggle' while leading the House to cut the NEH budget by 40 percent. The House also cut funding for the Smithsonian, the Kennedy Center, and the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. These are the prize jewels of our national culture. As Arthur Miller writes in The Nation, America's arts are getting far less government support than any other advanced society." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang Sunday<M>, July 23. 
<p>
<h3>A Man of Peace</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Yes Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, you are the enemy. Yes Clarence Thomas, you poor confused fellow, you are the enemy, and we are determined to turn you around, and if we don't, you are leading our country to a racial confrontation that we will all be the poorer for." <M>-- Harlem's Reverend Calvin Butts, in July 25 NBC News at Sunrise <M>profile by anchor Ann Curry of the Abyssinian Baptist "whose life's work has focused on fighting racial divisions." 
"The words of a peacemaker, Calvin Butts." <M>-- Curry, immediately after the story.
<p>
<h3>Atoning for Prosperity</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole has deftly shifted far to the right on the tax issue....Dole shepherded President Ronald Reagan's supply-side tax-cut proposals through Congress in 1981, and then, as an act of contrition, spent years trying to reverse the steady rise of red ink fueled by a recession, Reagan's peacetime defense buildup, and the impact of the tax cuts." <M>-- Washington Post<M> reporter Eric Pianin, August 6.
<p>
<h3>The Objective Eleanor Clift</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I'm a journalist, and I look at things objectively, and I think anybody looking at the Bosnia situation will agree that there are no good answers; and I don't really think this is something we want to play politics about." <M>-- Newsweek<M> reporter Eleanor Clift on CNN's Crossfire, <M>July 21<D>.
<p>
<dd>"That's right. It's not to anyone's advantage to have sleaze on television, and that's exactly what those hearings are. The Republicans do not have a single shred of new evidence." <M>-- Clift on Whitewater hearings, later in same show.
<p>
<h3>Know-Nothing Newt</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Great rhetoric, but Gingrich has trouble on the specifics. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, it's not what he doesn't know about the economy that's dangerous; it's what he does know that just ain't so....
<dd>"What's mostly missing from Gingrich's book is an analysis of what `winning' would really mean for millions of Americans. There is no mention of declining real wages or the growing gap in incomes and wealth, possibly for fear that raising the subject could fan some Democrats' demands for redistribution. And while he stresses the importance of lifelong learning, he doesn't reconcile this with proposed GOP cuts in federal student loan programs. These are strange deficits from a man who would clearly love to be President someday. Fortunately for the economy, Gingrich probably has time to do more reading and thinking before he ever sweeps into the Oval Office."  <M>-- U.S. News & World Report<M> Senior Writer Susan Dentzer reviewing Newt Gingrich's book To Renew America<M>, August 14.
<p>
<h3>Denying Liberal Bias is Nuts</h3>
<p>
<dd>"I think this is another reflection of the overwhelming journalistic tilt towards liberalism and those programs. Now the question is whether that's bad or not, and that's another debate. But the idea that many of us, and my colleagues deny that there is this kind of bias is nuts, because there is in our world. I forget what the surveys show but most of us are Democratic and probably most of us line up in the fairly liberal world." <M>-- Time<M> Washington contributing editor Hugh Sidey responding to a caller who asked if journalists are in favor of affirmative action, July 21 C-SPAN Washington Journal.
<p>
<h3>It's Good to See Athletes Speak Out -- Unless They're Conservative</h3>
<p>
<dd>"Whatever one thinks of Winslow's positions, it's encouraging to see a Stateside athlete -- particularly one who rose from the squalor of East St. Louis, Ill., to earn a law degree -- engaging himself in the world of which sports is only a small part." <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>'s 'Scorecard' feature on Kellen Winslow's Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech supporting affirmative action and racial quotas, August 7 issue.<D>
<p>
<big>vs.</big>
<p>
<dd>"Champions for Life, a 10-minute-long piece of antiabortion propaganda that first appeared 14 months ago, became the subject of controversy last week when the New York Giants made it to the Super Bowl...No matter how one feels about abortion, it's hard not to be repulsed by the video's inflammatory language....Jimmy Burt, Jr., the nine-year-old son of Jim Burt, a former Giant now with the 49ers, looks into the camera from atop his father's shoulders and says `It's great to be alive.'" <M>-- Sports Illustrated<M>, Feb. 4, 1991.

<center><H3>Peter Jennings: You Voters Need A Diaper</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any 
two-year-old and they can tell you about those temper tantrums: 
the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming. It's clear 
that the anger controls the child and not the other way around. 
It's the job of the parent to teach the child to control the anger 
and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of 
uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum 
last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: 
the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." -- Peter 
Jennings in his daily ABC Radio commentary, November 14.
<P>
"We say we are tired of politics because we are afraid of being 
fed simplistic lies. Yet voters are notorious for demanding that 
politicians commit themselves to cutting taxes while maintaining 
or increasing benefits for their constituents. There is no way 
those promises can be kept. Nevertheless we believe them, and 
express outrage when they cannot be kept. Believing invalid 
promises, hearing the siren song of term limits, listening to 
negative advertising -- all parts of the same dismal picture. 
Ultimately, many of the problems with politics may rest with the 
voters themselves." -- Jennings' commentary, November 3.

"The public seemed more intolerant than involved, uninterested in 
what the candidates have had to say, blindly voting against....The 
President might argue, with some justification, that it's the 
media's fault: we're allergic to good news." -- Newsweek Senior 
Editor Joe Klein, November 14.
<P>
<center><H3>Newt Gingrich, The Conservative Che Guevara </H3></center>
<P>
<P>
"From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's 
gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the 
Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism....It's a record filled 
with contradictions: the family-values candidate who divorced his 
ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 
22 checks at the House Bank, and runs a big-dollar political 
action committee that won't disclose its contributors....Gingrich 
himself, bombastic and ruthless, would be the most dramatic change 
imaginable, a change the administration can only dread." -- CBS 
reporter Eric Engberg, November  2 Evening News.
<P>
CBS News consultant Joe Klein: "Last weekend, he seemed to blame 
the murder of two small children in South Carolina on the 
Democrats. He said that if you want to end that sort of moral 
decay, vote Republican. And so political insiders were wondering 
this week, would Newt's new responsibilities make him more 
statesmanlike, more responsible, less flagrant? Naah!"
Gingrich: "It is impossible to take the Great Society structure of 
bureaucracy, the redistributionist model of how wealth is 
acquired, and the counterculture value system that now permeates 
the way we deal with the poor, and have any hope of fixing it. 
They are a disaster." -- CBS Evening News, November 13.

"It would strike some of us that the campaigns have all been so 
down and dirty and nasty and personal, there's no overarching 
mandate that the GOP can read into this...My memory after that '92 
convention the Republicans held in Texas, is that a lot of people, 
even Republicans, said `Good Lord, what have we done?' Because the 
party seemed to have skewed so to the right. Well, the whole 
country gets to see that now. It's at least conceivable they set 
up their own defeat in '96, isn't it?" -- CNN's Mary Tillotson,

"You're aligned to a party which owes many of its victories to the

S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts, November 9.
<P>
"The so-called Christian Coalition, as you know, is claiming a 
great deal of credit for GOP victories across the board. Are you 
not at all concerned about where their brand of, some would say, 
extremism or intolerance, may yet try to take your party?" -- 
Gumbel to Jack Kemp, November 10.

"You said the American people gave very clear orders. I read the 
transcript of your press conference yesterday and you talked at 
length of a Republican mandate. But in an off-year election where 
Republicans won the majority of only a 37 percent turnout, how 
broad a mandate can you rightfully claim?" -- Gumbel to Senator

more for it?....Last time that happened, in 1980, we ran up the 
deficit and also the federal debt to trillions of dollars." -- Tom 
Brokaw to Republican Senator-elect Bill Frist, November 9 NBC 
Nightly News.
<P>
"The fiscal centerpieces of the GOP program have surface appeal 
but do not appear to meet the traditional math test: They don't 
add up. President Ronald Reagan tried cutting taxes and increasing 
defense spending on the theory that growth would increase, which 
eventually would bring in more tax revenue. Then-Senate Majority 
Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) called it a `riverboat gamble.' And 
it was a gamble that lost: The federal budget deficit ballooned."

"They are not voting Republican tonight, Mary. They are voting 
against a lot of unhappiness in their own lives....I think that 
it's very easy for the Republicans to make the same mistake that 
the Democrats made in thinking that somehow we've been given this 
great mandate....They have got to be practical. They have got to 
compromise. They have got to meet the real needs of people. This 
is not an anti-government vote tonight." -- U.S. News & World 
Report Senior Writer Steven Roberts on CNBC's Equal Time, election 
night.
<P>
"The cynics would say this was a vote for gridlock, but I think 
it's easier to say, and the data points to the conclusion, that it 
was a vote for bipartisanship, for centrism." -- CNN's William 
Schneider, election night.
<P>
"If Bill Clinton and the Democrats were given a blow on Tuesday 
because they moved to the left, if the Republicans govern only 
from the right and abandon the center, my guess is the public will 
pay them back in the very near future....The American people 
aren't ideological. They don't want a liberal government, a 
conservative government. They want a centrist, moderate 
government, maybe tilt a bit right of center. They don't want 
extremes." -- Tim Russert, NBC News Washington Bureau Chief, 
November 13 Today.
<P>
"Both parties were sounding very conciliatory the morning after 
these midterm elections. But now it appears the gloves are 
starting to come out [sic]. We just heard Newt Gingrich make some

"Susan Smith knew what a kidnapper should look like....The suspect 
had to be a black man....And in a society that began to demonize 
African Americans almost as long as it enslaved them, blacks have 
endured being cast as menacing shadows at the edge of bad dreams. 
What has changed is that political rhetoric and pop culture are 
increasingly willing to expoit these shadows. When George Bush's 
1988 campaign needed a name and a face for the bogeyman, it came 
up with Willie Horton." -- Time Senior Writer Richard Lacayo,

"Like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, his liberal counterpart who also was 
nearly counted out, Cuomo is back. Propelled by the endorsement of 
New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, he has 
revived his campaign, not to mention his spirit, while his 
opponent, State Sen. George E. Pataki, has suffered an almost 
total meltdown with the rest of the state's Republican Party. 
Behind in the polls...Cuomo had seemed dispirited and unusually 
inarticulate about why voters should grant him a fourth term. 
However, he has since opened up an eight to 14 point lead while 
regaining the wit, agility and combativeness that brought him 
consideration as a presidential candidate, Supreme Court justice 
and Major League Baseball commissioner." -- Boston Globe news

"Republicans believe this is their year to rearrange the seating

November 5.

"I want you to think about this question not as a partisan 
Republican, but just as an American, who as I, loves this country. 
Two years ago the American voters gave Bill Clinton a mandate for 
change. He went to Washington, sought to create change. He had 
internal problems with his staff, he had external problems. There 
were questions about his personality, his character, et cetera. 
But I don't think anyone can question that this man and his staff 
sought what was best for the United States. Tonight, it is clear 
voters coast to coast in this country have said `We want a 
change.' Now Republicans had voted this Democrat to be virtually, 
or described him as a monster. My question is essentially this: 
Where did he go wrong? What did he do so wrong that was against 
the American body politic, considering that he loves this country 
as much as you and I do?" -- CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Pat

<title> TV Ratings </title>
<br>
<center><h2> TV Ratings&#58; A Fine Mess </h2></center>
<p>
The television ratings system has been in effect only since January 1, yet there's already plenty of evidence it's doing a poor job of informing parents about which programs are suitable, and which unsuitable, for their children.
<p>
So far, the most obvious flaw has to do with the treatment of sexual content. The networks, which rate their own offerings, repeatedly have given to racy shows ratings that indicate those shows are fine for youngsters. The following episodes were rated TV-PG, meaning "parental guidance [is] suggested the program may contain infrequent coarse language, limited violence, [and] some suggestive sexual dialogue and situations."  Given the sort of content we're talking about, that would seem much too mild a warning.
<p>
Take the January 6 "Ink," on CBS. This episode of the newspaper sitcom centered on a madam and her little black book. One reporter exulted, "This story has everything! Sex in a car, sex after lunch, sex under water." Another reporter reminisced about the time in boarding school when she "sold pictures of the gym teacher doing it with the headmaster." The next night, ABC's "Life's Work" contained jokes about a man who masturbated by rubbing against a tree.
<p>
NBC's night for smut was January 8. On "Wings," a character discussed how he and his girlfriend made love four times a day, and mentioned that the previous night, "we did it on the hood of my El Camino." On "Chicago Sons," a character expressed his desire to invite an attractive female colleague to a bed-and-breakfast, "where we'll eat pralines off each other's naked bodies."
<p>
The next night on NBC, "Friends" had one character talking about how depressed he was when he saw a woman he'd just split up with "just walkin' with her friend Donna, laughin' and talkin'. It killed me." His roommate replied, "Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
<p>
All those series air in the so-called family hour, between 8 and 9 p.m. Post-9 o'clock programming was raunchy as well: on January 8, NBC's "Men Behaving Badly" included a woman's reference to "fifty-five hours of nonstop sex" with a man she'd just met. "Men Behaving Badly" was rated, you guessed it, TV-PG.

<center><h2>Special Project & Report:<br>Bringing Back the Family Hour</h2></center>
	The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved national attention and impressive results. 
<P>
	At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the television networks to bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over <a href="/mrc/ptc/famhrad.html">70 members of Congress signed on to a letter </a> urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety.</i> Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah,</i> which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
	The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results.
<P>
	On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
	Bozell's "eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on the decision-making process at the network," echoed Jacqueline Lovejoy, the show's publicist. "[His] voice was powerful, and it was heard."
<P>
	Brandon Tartikoff, former chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah's</i> production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told <i><a href="/mrc/flash/flash.html"> Flash </a> </i> that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<a name="Summary"<a/>
<center><h3>Executive Summary</h3><P>
</center>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p>

<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>

   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.<p>

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.
<p>
  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
<p> 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>

  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
  <p> 
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  <p>
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  
<p>

   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   

<p>
  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   <p>
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
  <p> 
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
  <p> 
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
 <p> 
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
  <p> 
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
  <p> 
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
 <p> 

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
 <p> 
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
 <p> 
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
  <p> 
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
  <p> 
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
<p> 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 

<hr>
<a name="Three"</a>
<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>
   
<hr>
<a name="quan"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

<center><h2>Top 10 Best and Worst Primetime TV Shows</h2></center>
<P>
 MRC research has shown that while the number of prime time series
containing gratuitous sex and obscene language has increased,
wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment
Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the
least family-friendly prime time shows, but also named several
programs which respect family values and are appropriate for audiences
of all ages. 
<P>

<P>
 This report, which has been distributed to thousands of journalists
-- including television critics from print publications and television,
and radio talk show hosts, is the culmination of thousands of
hours of television analysis. As of press time, this annual season-end
tally has received widespread coverage in several major media
outlets, including <I>USA Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>,
<I>Los Angeles Times</I>, and was even included in Jay Leno's<I>
Tonight Show</I> monologue. 
<P>

<P>
<CENTER><h3>The Top Ten Least Family Friendly shows, in ranking
order:
</h3></CENTER>
<P>
1.<I><B>Married...With Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 9:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 The crudest comedy on prime time television, <I>Married</I> routinely
ridicules the family. Every week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot;
trade insults, celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom humor;
this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with lewd punch lines about
sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle, and the lead character's
fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs.
<P>
2. <I><B>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content despite the
show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. Virtually every episode
revolves around sexual themes and contains inappropriate language,
and each of the six central characters, all single twentysomethings,
is sexually active. Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting
and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>
3. <I><B>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 pm time slot
has done little to mitigate the show's content. The series' central
characters are openly derisive of their parents; religion and
the religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; premarital
sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>
4. <I><B>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly in and out of
one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex.
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with
one gay character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>
5. <I><B>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) Miniseries
<P>
 Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members
of a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in
public while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital
andextramarital affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up
schemes. 
<P>
6. <I><B>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, <I>CPW</I>
condoned premarital sex and adultery, and aired scenes containing
foul language and explicitly sexual content. Fortunately, the
acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in
to its sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>
7. <I><B>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) Thursday 9:30 EST
(Canceled)
<P>
 The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with obscenity-laden
skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers withdrew
their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off
the air.
<P>
8. <I><B>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits. Dialogue
is littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive
scenarios. The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution
of marriage. Casual sex -- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>
9. <I><B>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) Wednesday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
 While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity,
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been
more than happy to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and
completely inconsequential --  fact of college life. The teen-targeted
soap sends mixed messages on drugs: positive characters deride
substance abuse, but rarely address the illegality of drug use.
<P>
10.<I><B> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom.
Most of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with
sexual references and obscene language.
<P>
<BR>

<center><h3>The Most Family Friendly Shows</h3></center>
<P>
 The Most Family-friendly shows on prime time contain wholesome
subject matter for viewing by all ages. These prime time offerings
include:<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Touched By an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 One of CBS' few success stories of the season, <I>Touched By
An Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of traditional values
on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama showcases God's
message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of prayer,
and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties.
<P>
<I><B>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's
most pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental
authority as the key to a strong family unit, and advocate premarital
chastity, individual responsibility, and faith.
<P>
<I><B>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title
character, a young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of
his three younger siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices
to ensure that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing.
The show imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and
taking responsibility for one's actions.
<P>
<I><B>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 8:00 p.m.
EST
<P>
<I> Dr. Quinn's</I> promotion of traditional values has endeared
it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and family are staunchly
promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and respect for parental
authority. The drama boasts one of prime time's most positive
clerics -- &quot;the Reverend,&quot; a series regular, is depicted
as an intelligent, caring, and very dedicated member of the community.
<P>
<I><B>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>
 This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife,
and their children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable
lessons about teenage drinking, honesty, respect and the importance
of education. One of prime time's foremost advocates of the institution
of marriage, the show frequently addresses the challenges faced
by the husband and wife and the steps they take toward strengthening
their relationship. 
<P>
<I><B>Lois &amp; Clark: the New Adventures of Superman</B></I>
(ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>
<I> Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive dialogue and
sexual references of its 1993-94 inaugural season, and, in the
words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove
that television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator
to provide quality entertainment: dialogue and fast-paced action
sequences are free of offensive language and sexual innuendo,
and the newly-engaged protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P>
<I><B>The Parent 'Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>
 Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 'Hood'</I>s central
characters provide positive role models for viewers of all ages.
The happily-married African-American couple, both successful professionals,
teach their children that education, self-discipline and integrity
are keys to success. The positive impact of a father in the household,
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage is also underscored.

ABOUT THE PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL
</center></h2><br><p><b>
"Bringing responsibility to television programming"</b>
<P>
The Parents Television Council (PTC) was established in 1995 as a special project of the 
Media Research Center to bring America's demand for values-driven television programming to 
the entertainment industry.
<P>
The PTC offers private sector solutions to restore television to its roots as an independent 
and socially responsible entertainment medium. Much of the PTC's success stems from urging 
the public to voice its support of family-friendly programming to network executives, 
advertisers, and public policy leaders. The PTC has employed these efforts to help save values- 
driven shows such as ABC's <i>Second Noah</i> and CBS's <i>Touched By An Angel</i>.
<P>
Along with empowering the public to voice their concerns, the PTC organized a star-
studded group of industry leaders to become members of  the Parents Televisions Council's  
Advisory Board. These spokespersons address issues relating to television entertainment and its 
impact on families across America.
<P>
More information on the PTC can be found in its flagship publication, the <a href="/mrc/entertainment/95famgui.html">1995-`96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Programming</a>, the only comprehensive study of prime time's 
content available in America. Profiling every sitcom and drama on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN 
and WB, the <i>Family Guide</i> provides viewers with information on subject matter that is 
inappropriate for children while also identifying shows which promote family-friendly themes.
<P>
For more information on the Parents Television Council, or to simply give us your 
feedback on today's prime time programming, please <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">e-mail</a> us.

<p>
Dear Mr. Harbert, Mr. Moonves, Mr. Matoian, Mr. Littlefield, Ms. Salhany, and Mr. Kellner:
<p>
     Until recently, the major networks set aside the first hour 
of prime time for family programming. This timeslot featured such 
wholesome series as <i>Happy Days</i>, <i>Little House on 
the Prairie</i>, and <i>The Cosby Show</i>; adult-oriented fare was relegated to the late evening hours.
<p>     
This voluntary covenant with the viewing public has disintegrated to the point where the former Family Hour now features sitcoms and dramas promoting promiscuity and obscene language.
<p>     
We, the Members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, urge you, the leaders of the 
major commercial broadcast networks, to recognize the pernicious effects of this programming on our children and voluntarily 
return to the spirit of the Family Hour. By creating a safe haven for the family viewing audience, and resolving to dedicate one 
hour of prime time programming to the promotion of positive values, the entertainment industry would not only endear itself to 
parents, but also immeasurably benefit American society.

<TITLE> Restoring Family Hour </TITLE>

<blockquote>
<h2><center>Restoring the Spirit of The Family Hour</h2></center>
<P>
The Media Research Center's campaign to restore the spirit of the "Family Hour" has had impressive results. 
<P>
In April, the MRC organized a bi-partisan coalition of United States Senators and Representatives who challenged the television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared as a full-page ad in the show-business newspaper <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<p> 
MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell followed up with a May 7 letter to ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert asking him to renew the highly acclaimed family drama <i>Second Noah</i>, which debuted this past February and whose future was undecided.
<P>
The advertisement and the letter had demonstrable results: On May 20, ABC announced that <i>Second Noah</i> was on its fall schedule and would air Saturdays at 8 p.m. EST. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that the <i>Daily Variety</i> ad "struck just the right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear."  	
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, then the chairman of New World Television, <i>Second Noah</i>'s production company, has also recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told Flash, the MRC's monthly membership newsletter, that "support by Brent Bozell and his joint efforts with members of Congress...not only influenced ABC's decision to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of <i>Second Noah</i> on Saturday nights, among the best times for family viewing."

<P>
<I>Dear Friend,<BR>
<P>							

After spending weeks predicting the Republicans' chances of holding on to their majorities in Congress were shaky at best, the media completely ignored their stunning comeback on Election Day. <BR>
<P>

Think about it. Big Labor, according to <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, spent nearly $500 million in a savage, year-long campaign of distortions and outright lies, to defeat the Republicans. Their primary targets were the conservative freshmen in the House; the unions were out to destroy them. <BR>
<P>

Other left-wing special interests, from Hollywood to wacky environmentalists, spent millions more. Topping it off Bill Clinton and Al Gore lied in the national debates, in nationwide advertisements, and in hundreds of speeches, constantly endorsing conservative issues they'd actually vetoed! <BR>
<P>

It was, to my thinking, the most dishonest campaign I've ever seen. <BR>
<P>

So, where was the national press holding the Clinton campaign accountable for all the distortions and lies? Why didn't the national media expose the fact that 35% of union members voted Republican - yet union bosses forced them to pay for the anti-GOP ads? Where were the investigative reports on Clinton scandals by the television networks? Nowhere. The left wing so-called "objective" media did nothing to expose this fraud. <BR>
<P>

Why? Maybe because the media themselves have been promoting the very same anti-GOP distortions while actively pushing for Clinton's re-election. <BR>
<P>

This election not only proved to be an egg-on-your-face embarrassment for the unions and bureaucrat-hugging environmentalists, it was an embarrassment for the media.  Conservatives survived in the House, even increased their numbers in the Senate. <BR>
<P>

This past year we've updated you on our <a href="/mrc/reality/"> Media Reality Check '96 </a> campaign to hold the media accountable for their lies and distortions. Thanks to all your support, our campaign reached millions of Americans daily through newspapers, magazines, and talk radio. Because of our campaign, some reporters are now -- finally! --  admitting there is a liberal bias in the media. Even Walter Cronkite is admitting what he denied for 30 years. "Everyone knows that there is a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." <BR>
<P>

It took Walter Cronkite 30 years to figure out what we've known for 30 years. <BR>
<P>

Over the next few months, you can bet the networks will continue to ignore the many Clinton scandals that are currently under investigation. And the MRC will continue to expose the media's lies and distortions, throughout Clinton's second term. <BR>
<P>

For the past several weeks our <a href="/mrc/news/"> News Division </a> has been aggressively reviewing four years' worth of media reports on Clinton scandals, and the stories the networks have never bothered to air. There have been countless investigative stories in <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, <b>The Washington Times</b>, even the liberal <b>Washington Post</b> and <b>Los Angeles Times</b>. And still there's been silence from the networks. When the study is done, and I give you the results, you are going to be amazed by the media cover-up, I promise. <BR>
<P>

A study like this is a huge undertaking - nothing like this has ever been done. We are going to prove once and for all the media helped deliver Clinton to the White House - not once, but twice - by refusing to report the truth. <BR>
<P>

I invite you join us by becoming an <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">MRC Member </a>.  Help stop the media's lies and distortions. <BR>
<P>

By becoming a <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Member</a>  you'll receive MRC's monthly membership newsletter <a href="/mrc/membership/flash.html">Flash</a> , which details our studies, research, and projects. Other  <a href="/mrc/membership/benefits.html">Membership Benefits </a> include updates from me, discounts on all our books and publications - up to 50% off, and much more. <BR>
<P>

Through our web site we are offering <a href="/mrc/membership/membership.html.cgi">Free Membership</a> for six-months! <BR>
<P> 

The work of the Media Research Center is more important than ever. Become a member today, and join us in our efforts to neutralize and expose the media's leftist attacks on conservatives. <BR>
<P>

Sincerely, <BR>
<P>

<p>
<a href="/mrc/nq">Notable Quotables</a> is a bi-weekly 
compilation of the most outrageous and humorous examples of 
liberal media bias. At year-end a Best Of NQ issue presents 
the most biased quotes of the year. It's available for $19 a year.

<html><head><title>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><blockquote><center><h2>Revolving Door for January 1995 Media Watch</h2><p><h3>Revolving Door Spins More for Clinton Administration than Bush's</h3></center>A Very Comfortable Relationship<p><dd>As Bill Clinton's nomination became secure in 1992, former Newsweek reporter Mickey Kaus predicted reporters would be rewarded. In the May 11 New Republic he wrote: "Many pro-Clinton journalists can reasonably hope for something more than glamorous candlelight dinners in the Clinton White House. They can hope for jobs in the Clinton White House."<p><dd>A MediaWatch study of this "revolving door" has proven Kaus prophetic. In just two years, more than twice as many members of the media have joined the Clinton administration (33) as jumped to the Bush team in four years (15). The study counted those with influence over news coverage at a national media outlet who left to take a politically appointed slot with the administrations.  Those who decided to join Clinton's team held higher profile or more influential media slots than did those whom Bush attracted: <p><dd>While no on-air network TV reporter joined the Bush team, so far six have taken Clinton jobs. <p><dd>Ten network producers, executives, and researchers have made the jump to Clinton's staff, compared to just three during the Bush years.<p><dd>Another 13 major newspaper and magazine reporters hopped aboard the Clinton team while just eight put in a stint for Bush.    In alphabetical order, here are the revolvers listed with their administration title and dates of service, followed by their media position. <p>Clinton Administration:<p><ol><li>Kevin Anderson: Health care spokes-man, White House public affairs office, 1993USA Today Money section reporter<li>Kenneth Bacon: Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, 1994-Wall Street Journal Washington bureau reporter, 1969-1994<li>Donald Baer: Director of White House speechwriting and research, 1994- U.S. News & World Report Asst.

<CENTER><H2>The Free Market Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The Free Market Project is the business and economics arm of the Media Research Center. The Project 
analyzes both the entertainment and news media to determine how they portray the free enterprise system. 
The Project engages in three main activities: 
<p> 
<ol> 
<li> <a href="/mrc/medianomics/"> MediaNomics </a>, a monthly four-page supplement to<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/"> MediaWatch </a>. MediaNomics reports on how the 
national media cover business and economics. Each issue includes an in-depth study of media coverage of 
a particular economic issue, such as the flat tax, minimum wage proposals, or Medicare reform. Every 
month MediaNomics commissions a prominent free-market economist to write an essay about how the 
media could improve their coverage of a particular economic issue. 
<p> 
<li> Quarterly Breakfast Forums. Every few months, the MRC's Free Market Project hosts a breakfast 
forum at the National Press Club for reporters. Each forum features a prominent conservative economist 
and policymaker, who give the media their side of the story on an issue in the news. In March, for instance, 
presidential candidate Steve Forbes talked about the flat tax and how reporters ought to cover it. 
<p>
<li> Joint Projects. The MRC's Free Market Project is also a vehicle for other conservative organizations or 
industry groups to analyze and criticize the press. Currently, the MRC is involved in a joint project with 
Consumer Alert, which will determine whether there is an anti-free market bias in large-circulation 
consumer publications. 
</ol> 
<p> 
The work of the MRC's Free Market Project has had a wide influence, being quoted in the Harvard 
Business Review, Inc., Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today's "Money" 
section, among many, many other publications. It is the only organization devoted solely to analyzing 
media coverage of business and the economy. 
<p> 
<p>

Each month MediaNomics points out such glaring omissions in the news. To subscribe to MediaNomics

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
November 21, 1996<br>
<P>
<center><h1> Women's Magazines: A Liberal Pipeline to Soccer Moms </h1></center><br>
<P>
<P>
<P>
	High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and personal care, and dieting.  Surprisingly, many also deal with public policy issues relating to government activism and women's and families' health and safety.<BR>
<P>
	A joint <a href=" http://www.his.com/~calert"> Consumer Alert </a> / <a href="/mrc/about/ "> Media Research Center </a> study of 13 women's and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage.  Part I of the study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was depicted positively or negatively.  Part II looked at the magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues relating to health and safety.  The study found: <BR>
<P>

<LI>In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more.  There were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less. <BR>


<LI>Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government -- they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. <BR>


<LI>In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against mainstream science. <BR>

<LI>According to women's magazines, recycling is always good.  Out of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. <BR>

<LI>Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. <BR>
<P>

	Recommendations:  Look for balance in coverage of public policy issues.  Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of view.  Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or gals) and bad guys?  Be skeptical of articles that provide only anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence. <BR>
<P>
<P>
<b><h2>Part I: Calling for a Village</h2></b><br>
<P>
 "Soccer Moms." This term struck as much fear into the hearts of conservatives during the 1996 election campaign as "Angry White Men" did in liberals in 1994. Conventional wisdom has it that the limited-government policies of the GOP just did not resonate with these suburban housewives, creating a gender gap that cost Bob Dole dearly at the polls.<BR>
<P>
Why the apparent skepticism among women towards smaller government, especially since in some polls they strongly favor reducing taxes and cutting wasteful spending? Perhaps at least part of the reason can be found in a joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of the publications that Soccer Moms read. Each month, as they perused the pages of their favorite magazines, women were not merely learning new recipes, the latest diet ideas, and how to have better relationships with their husbands or boyfriends; they were also often being told that government was the solution to most of society's problems, and they were being urged to lobby for its expansion. <BR>
<p>
For the study, Consumer Alert and the Media Research Center analyzed the October 1995 through September 1996 issues of thirteen family and women's publications -- <i>Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Woman's Day, and Working Woman</i>.<BR>
<p>
Overall, there were 115 positive portrayals of government intervention in the market and/or calls for such intervention during the study period. There were only 18 negative portrayals of government intervention and/or calls for cutbacks in government spending or regulation. There were five balanced portrayals of policy issues. <BR>
<p>
Working Woman</i> and <i>Glamour</i> were the most biased in favor of expanding government. Each had 24 positive portrayals of government activism compared to four negative portrayals. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> was next with 15 stories promoting bigger government and only three stories promoting smaller government.<p>
Ladies' Home Journal</i> was the most politically balanced magazine in the study. Although the monthly ran ten stories promoting bigger government, it also ran six promoting limited government and ran four balanced stories. Two of the magazines, <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i> and <i>Prevention</i>, almost completely avoided public policy issues during the study period. <BR>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</B> Health-related issues brought forth the most calls for government intervention. There were 28 such stories. Seven focused on "drive-through deliveries," in which insurance companies didn't pay for women to stay in the hospital for longer than one day after giving birth. <i>Good Housekeeping </i>warned that "tiny lives are at risk" and advised readers on "how you can help stop this shocking practice." The magazine provided a form readers could send to Congress to demand regulations extending hospital stays. <BR>
<p>
Seventeen stories demanded increased federal funding for medical research into everything from AIDS to obesity to breast cancer, with no mention of how this new spending would be paid for. It didn't seem to matter because, according to <i>Woman's Day</i>, women had a "right" to quality health care. Liberal journalist Margaret Carlson, writing for <i>Glamour</i>, argued that families did too. Republican Medicare reform efforts, she wrote, would hurt the party with women: "If Granny gets booted out of the nursing home for lack of Medicare funds, it will be the woman of the house who picks her up." <BR>
<p>
Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and managed care in general, took a beating in family publications. There were nine stories about the horrors people had faced at the hands of heartless health care bureaucracies. None of these stories discussed the health care reform option many market-oriented reformers promote -- Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). MSA advocates argue that such accounts would put health care dollars in the hands of consumers, giving them an incentive to find bargains and employ preventive medicine. A search of the EBSCO Publishing database found that there were no mentions of MSAs in these magazines during the study period; other magazines mentioned MSAs in 121 articles. <BR>
<p> 
Instead of discussing the problems of systems relying on third-party payers, women's and family magazines often proposed expanding such systems. In the September <i>Glamour</i> freelance writer Tessa DeCarlo urged readers not to "give up on universal coverage...No reform of managed care can be completely successful as long as more than 40 million Americans don't have any health coverage at all." She also wrote that laws should be changed to encourage more medical lawsuits. <BR>
<p>
<B>Urging Readers to Lobby.</b> Twenty- three stories went beyond merely promoting bigger government as the solution to problems; they also asked readers to contact Congressmen or other government officials to lobby on behalf of bigger government. <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided form letters ("Join the <i>Good Housekeeping</i> Lobby") that merely needed a signature. After a June, 1996 story about Christopher Reeve and his life since his equestrian accident, for instance, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> provided a letter to Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations. The letter told Sen. Specter: "Please add my name to the list of supporters of increased funding for spinal cord injury (SCI) research during fiscal year 1997." <BR>
<p>
Other publications, while not going to such elaborate lengths, nonetheless prodded readers into lobbying for bigger government. Three stories highlighted the "These Children Have Faces" campaign. Under the headline "Has Congress Put Children in Danger?" the May <i>Glamour</i> told readers that the group's founders "devised a plan to let politicians know that children's allies are watching: They're collecting photos of young people, with notes about their parents' fears and hopes, and will deliver the pictures to Congress next month." <i>Glamour</i> advised its readers on how to participate. <BR>
<p>
In a November 1, 1995 <i>Woman's Day </i>story about osteoporosis, <i>Woman's Day </i>told readers to "urge your members of Congress to work for more women's health research funding."<i> Woman's Day's </i>Dr. Loraine Stern, who writes the "Your Child's Health" column, wrote: "If you agree that immunizations should be fully covered for all children in need, tell your insurance company and<F255D> your representatives in Washington." In March, Weight Watchers alerted readers to a new advocacy group, the American Obesity Association, whose "first priority is to lobby the federal government to spend more money on obesity research." The magazine then told readers how to get in touch with the group to help. <BR>
<p>
The September <i>Mademoiselle</i> explained the nuts and bolts of writing a letter to Congress, using the example of a group called 20/20 Vision, which claims to have halted an "environmentally disastrous" plutonium-processing plant through a letter-writing campaign. The October, 1995 <i>Mademoiselle</i> urged 20-somethings to vote, strongly implying that they should support a liberal agenda. "The Contract with America, tax breaks for the rich, the end of public TV -- was this what my fellow Gen-Xers wanted? It's impossible to know, because most of us didn't vote," wrote freelance writer Esther Gabara. <BR>
<p>
<B>Promoting Liberal Activists.</b> Well-known liberal activists and political figures were profiled or prominently mentioned 18 times by these magazines. Marian Wright Edelman was the clear favorite, being promoted in<i> Family Circle, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle Parents</i>, and <i>Working Woman</i>.<i> Family Circle</i> seemed particularly enamored with the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) founder, mentioning her on four different occasions. The November 1, 1995 "From the Editor" section featured a prayer drawn from Edelman's latest book; the May 14 issue gave Edelman the magazine's "Lifetime Achievement Award" for such accomplishments as increasing Head Start funding; the June 4 issue promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march in Washington. And when the editors of <i>Family Circle</i> picked the 25 best-selling books "that can change your life," a recent Edelman book made the list. <BR>
<p>
<i>Good Housekeeping</i> also promoted Edelman's "Stand for Children" march on Washington; <i>Parents</i> editor Ann Pleshette Murphy pointed out with pride that Edelman won that magazine's first "As They Grow Award," and <i>Mademoiselle</i>, in a sidebar to a September article about poverty, urged readers to send a check to the CDF and provided the group's address. At no point did any of these publications question Edelman's policy prescriptions. They could have pointed out, for example, that Census Bureau statistics show that child poverty went down every year between 1983 and 1989, when Ronald Reagan's policies, which Edelman opposed, were in effect. But no critic or criticism of Edelman was mentioned. <BR>
<p>
Some magazines had regular features to highlight liberals. <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women in Washington" column, for instance, reported on the work of female representatives and senators -- but usually only the ones who were working to expand the role of government. One month, the column praised a host of female legislators for increasing funding for child care "during last year's bitter welfare debate." Another column expressed relief that "while members of Congress were slashing funding for almost all federally funded programs last fall and winter, Congresswomen from both parties managed to engineer a triumph for breast-cancer programs." In July, 1996, the column praised Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and Rep. Louise Slaughter for expanding regulation in health care. <BR>
<p>
The magazines also promoted the liberal agenda by quoting "authorities" from liberal activist groups. <i>Weight Watchers</I> for instance, promoted the views of the Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen Health Research Group in a May story warning about databases of medical records maintained by insurance companies to evaluate risk. No other counter-source was quoted. <i>Woman's Day</i> gave kudos to the World Wildlife Fund for protecting rhinos from poachers in Nepal, yet didn't mention private property approaches to wildlife preservation that, for instance, have increased elephant herds dramatically in Zimbabwe, where hunting is permitted as a property right and villagers have incentives to protect their property. <BR>
<p>
Liberal activists themselves often wrote stories for these magazines. Edelman wrote an essay for <i>Parents</i> to promote her Stand for Children march. Representative Pat Schroeder explained to <i>Glamour</i> readers why she was leaving Congress, even though she was "proud to be the sponsor of many bills that helped women and children, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Women's Health Equity Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Women's Economic Equity Act." <BR>
<p>
<I>Prevention</i>, which usually shied away from outright political stances, nonetheless allowed space in its October, 1995 issue for Hillary Clinton to tout government-run health care. "Taking steps to protect our children's health is one of the soundest investments our nation can make," the first lady opined. "President Clinton has initiated a campaign to improve immunization services, lower costs, reach out to families and ensure that all young children receive the vaccinations they need. In addition, Medicaid has provided millions of young children with important preventive health services." <BR>
<p>
Two staffers at the magazines even became liberal activists for a time, attending the United Nations' World Conference on Women in Beijing. "What hit me...was the passionate belief shared by women everywhere that we have a <i>right</i> to good health care," wrote Dr. Marie Savard, who penned the "Your Health" section of <i>Woman's Day, Ladies' Home Journal</i> editor-in-chief Myrna Blyth also attended, writing that the evening after Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech, the American delegation "got into a large circle, held hands and sang some sixties-style folk songs." <BR>
<p>
There were some conservative and/or Republican women profiled by these magazines, but their political views were often challenged instead of celebrated. Liberal journalist Eleanor Clift, for instance, profiled New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman for the November, 1995 <i>Working Woman</i>. While the story was generally upbeat, Clift took a shot at Whitman's tax-cutting policies: "In order to cut income taxes by 30 percent, she has increased long-term borrowing, reduced payments to public pension funds and cut state aid to local governments. The ripple effect of those steps is yet to be fully realized." <BR>
<p>
Republican women would often be praised...when they worked to expand the role of government. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, for example, was chosen as one of <i>Glamour</i>'s "Women of the Year" for working to ban assault weapons, for expanding regulation of health care, and for, in general, not being "extreme." <BR>
<p>
On a more balanced note, <i>Good Housekeeping</i> devoted the back page of each issue to an essay by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan. But Noonan rarely mentioned public policy issues in her essays. <BR>
<p>
<B>Lost Opportunities.</b> There were numerous stories in which the case that big-government policies hurt consumers, families, and women could have been made, but wasn't. Many articles eagerly announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just approved a new drug or medical device. The November 1, 1995 <i>Family Circle </i>reported that "the FDA has approved the drug Caverject, which treats impotence, a condition affecting as many as 20 million men." This, the headline declared, was "good news for couples." While it may indeed have been good news for couples at the time, <i>Family Circle</i> didn't mention those who had been suffering before the FDA had gotten around to approving the treatment. <BR>
<p>
Only <i>Good Housekeeping </I> condemned FDA policy. The magazine's February, 1996 issue took the agency to task for not allowing the breast cancer Sensor Pad onto the market. "Women are not stupid," writer Laura Muha declared. "They ought to be able to decide whether this is something they want." But <i>Good Housekeeping</i> didn't ask if other life-saving products were being held up by the FDA. <BR>
<p>
Another lost opportunity: taxes. There were nine major stories about financially strapped families and the stress this caused family members. <i>Parents</i>, for instance, labeled the dilemma: "Mommy guilt vs. economic reality." Only one of these stories mentioned the rising tax burden on families. Even that one didn't point out what the Tax Foundation found: that taxes take more from a family than food, clothing, and housing costs combined. No story urged readers to lobby Congress for tax cuts, as these magazines had done for more liberal policies which allegedly would help families. <BR>
<p>
These magazines also ignored the regulatory burden on women. Only one article, in <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, pointed out that regulations hurt small business owners, many of whom are women. The September issue of that magazine profiled a woman who had owned a garbage-hauling and recycling business, but was forced out of business because of the high costs of government regulation. No story all year pointed out that, according to the Small Business Administration, government regulations cost almost $7,000 per American household, or how such regulations raise the prices of the products women and families buy. <BR>
<p>
And stories about safety didn't point out that often government policies undermine the safety of consumers. The April, 1996 <i>Better Homes & Gardens</i>, for instance, reported that "the larger your car, the less likely you are to be hurt if involved in an accident. That's the not-so-shocking conclusion of an insurance claim analysis for 1992-1994 models." But the magazine didn't then point out that federal fuel economy regulations encourage smaller, and therefore more dangerous, cars. <BR>
<p>
<B>"<i>Redbook</i> Strategy."</b> The Clinton campaign understood what an asset it had in family and women's magazines. It pursued, according to <i>U.S News & World Report</i>, a "<i>Redbook</i> strategy" aimed at courting the demographic group to which most of the readers of women's and family magazines belong. <i>Redbook</i> editor Kate White, in an article about "Why you're the White House's secret weapon," wrote that she was "flattered." But the magazines themselves, by promoting big government, had laid the groundwork for such a strategy to be successful. In doing so, they often misled their readers -- or didn't give them the whole story -- about the downside of government activism for women and families.<BR>
<p>
<P>
<b><h2>Part II: Scaring Women to Death</b></h2>
"Gender plays ... a powerful role in perception of hazards." That was the conclusion of Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis after the center polled more than 1,000 Americans to find out whether they believe in widely reported, but unproven, "hazards." Graham found that women were more likely to believe such scares were true by margins of 10 points or more, but he couldn't figure out why. "Some suggest that because women give birth, protect, and care for their children, they may naturally tend to be more nurturing than men, therefore they may be more concerned about hazards that may harm their families," Graham speculated. "Another possible explanation is that women are less familiar with science and technology than men, and are generally more fearful of it, especially in relation to nuclear power and chemicals." But Graham ended up concluding that "the role of gender in risk is more profound than can be explained by either the 'nurturing' or 'worldview' hypothesis" and that "more research is needed to understand why gender plays such a powerful role in perception of hazards." <BR>
<p>

One explanation Graham did not explore is that the reporting about risks in women's magazines may play a role in how women perceive those risks. After all, many women read these magazines not just for recipes and marriage advice but to receive important information about their own and their families' health. In a 1995 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, 80 percent of the female respondents said that women's magazines were a valuable source of information for them about nutrition. Overall, women's magazines ranked above TV news, newspaper articles, and even nurses as valuable sources of nutrition information. <BR>
<p>
 
Some advocacy groups already recognize that women's magazines can be a valuable ally in promoting their ideological agenda. In <I>Science Under Siege</i>, Michael Fumento reported that public relations agent David Fenton arranged interviews months in advance with magazines such as <I>Woman's Day</i> and <I>Redbook</i> to hype the scare he was orchestrating about the pesticide Alar that has now been widely discredited by respected scientists. The magazines readily complied with Fenton in 1989 with headlines such as "The Foods that Are Poisoning Your Child" (<I>Redbook</i>) and "Are Pesticides Poisoning  Our Children?" (<I>Woman's Day</i>)<BR>
<p>

Mainstream media outlets are not above running alarming stories about unproven risks either, but they usually give at least some space or air time to the other side. Articles in women's magazines, by contrast, frequently don't even acknowledge that there is another side. Many of the stories appear to be spoon-fed to the magazines by activists and go against mainstream science. Yet as the ADA survey suggests, women tend to trust these magazines more than any other type of media. The following examination of how these magazines -- <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I>, <I>Faily Circle</I>, <I>Glamour</I>, <I>Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Parents, Redbook, Weight Watchers and Woman's Day</I>  --  treat certain risk issues indicates that much of this trust is misplaced. (Two of the magazines surveyed, <I>Prevention</I> and <I>Working Woman</I>, did not report on the risk issues studied here.) <BR>
<p>

<B>Chemicals and Health Effects.</b> "One of the most overblown risks is that minute quantities of pesticide residues on food are related to human cancer," Harvard's Graham told <I>Weight Watchers</I> </I>(December 1995)  in one of the only articles to put this risk in perspective. Other articles, including one in <I>Weight Watchers</I> itself, indicate that these magazines seem to have learned very little in the seven years since the Alar scare. The National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific body in the U.S., recently concluded that most "synthetic chemicals appear to be present at levels below which any significant biologic effect is likely, and so low that they are unlikely  to pose an appreciable cancer risk." The NAS also pointed out that man-made pesticides are greatly outnumbered by natural pesticides plants make themselves, and that many of these natural chemicals have been found to be just as potent as the synthetic ones. <BR>
<p>

Nevertheless, according to Graham's poll, around 70 percent of women believe pesticides pose a hazard (compared with less than 60 percent of men), and an examination of this issue's coverage in women's magazines helps explain why. Of the 15 stories on claims of serious health effects from chemicals, eight of the stories were completely one-sided and mentioned no skeptical arguments against the claims. Three of the stories mentioned opposing arguments, but did so in a superficial manner. Only 4 out of the 15 articles were balanced in that they explored skeptical arguments in detail and tried to get to the scientific truth. <BR>
<p>

In an August 6 <I>Faily Circle</I> article entitled "Danger in the House," the author warns of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides that "pose potential health risks ranging from allergic reactions to cancer." The article mentions no scientists who question these risks nor does it mention what level of exposure is needed before these ill health effects occur (just about all substances, natural and artificial, are harmful at some level). And the author uses the flimsy anecdotal case of a mother who blamed garden pesticides sprayed in her neighborhood for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting (which could have had any number of causes), even though she didn't know what pesticides were being sprayed. The April <I>McCall's</I> ran a slightly less hysterical article on garden pesticides, but urged readers to contact the National Coalition Against the Issue of Pesticides, a radical environmental group that wants to ban pesticides even if they pose a very small risk. <BR>
<p>

<I>McCall's</I> (February 1996) and <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> (March 1996) warned of pesticide residues in baby food, and these articles also contained no arguments casting doubt on pesticides dangers, although <I>McCall's</I> did quote a doctor saying that "the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables are far, far greater than the risks." The article pointed out that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults, but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. The articles also recommend that parents buy more expensive organic baby food, without mentioning the natural pesticide residues that may be contained in these foods and pose the same (small) risk. <BR>
<p>

Three stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996), <I>Glamour</I> (April 1996), and <I>Weight Watchers</II> </I>(June 1996) that reported on the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer never mentioned that the largest study ever conducted found no correlation between that disease and synthetic chemicals such as DDT and PCBs. <I>Weight Watchers</I>  even condemned scientific studies that pointed to other possible causes such as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." <BR>
 <p>

The magazines that covered the newer chemical scare about "environmental estrogens" that allegedly affect reproductive health didn't fare much better. The two  stories in <I>Mademoiselle</I> (June 1996) and <I>Glamour </I>(April 1996) at least aired skeptical viewpoints but gave those opinions only a fraction of the space devoted to arguments for the scare. And both stories ignored important counter-arguments to some of the "facts" asserted by environmentalists. <I>Glamour</I>, for instance, did not report that the study that found declining sperm counts, a supposed effect of synthetic chemicals, had been severely criticized by many respected scientists and in an editorial in the very scientific journal that originally published it. <I>Mademoiselle</I> did mention in parentheses a new conflicting study that found that sperm counts have actually increased in the U.S. But the article did not mention how the new study casts doubts on the old study's finding of declining sperm counts by highlighting the geographic variation in sperm counts that the old study did not account for. Neither article mentioned that humans are exposed to far more natural estrogens from plants than to synthetic estrogen-licking chemicals. <BR>
<p>

The only story to mention pesticides' benefits in producing an affordable, abundant supply of fruits and vegetables was a July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that quoted an industry spokesman saying that he'd "rather take a chance on one ppb [parts per billion] in the food than on having no food at all." Unfortunately, the article then undercuts balance and accuracy by stating, without any evidence, that "concern about pesticide residue ... will become a moot point as the quality of organic produce continues to improve." This is wishful thinking. Agricultural experts such as the Hudson Institute's Dennis Avery, the former senior agricultural analyst for the U.S. Department of State, point out that crop yields from organic farms are typically less than half of those from conventional, high-yield farms, and that organic farms show no signs of catching up anytime soon. <BR>
<p>

The only two articles that critically examined chemical scares were stories in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (September) and <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I> (March) that pointed out the lack of scientific evidence behind claims that artificial sweeteners were harmful. An article in the January</II> <I>Glamour </I>that has dentists rate natural toothpastes also deserves kudos because it points out that natural isn't always good and artificial isn't always bad. The dentists note that many of the natural toothpastes lack fluoride, which provides the most vital protection against decay, and that  many of the toothpastes' natural ingredients such as baking soda and sea salt may wear down tooth enamel. <BR>
 <p>

On the bright side, the magazines proved very capable of putting minor health effects from food ingredients in perspective. Most of the nine articles on the fat substitute olestra were just as good, if not better, than those published in the mainstream media. Six stories were careful to mention that only some people get side effects such as diarrhea, and that olestra snacks are fortified with vitamins to make up for the nutrients that olestra inhibits the body from receiving from other foods. Two articles in <I>Weight Watchers </I>(March and June) went over the arguments of olestra's defenders superficially, and only one article was completely one-sided against olestra and this was clearly marked in <I>Woman's Day</I> (July 16) as an opinion piece. <I>McCall's</I> gave the most balanced coverage of all by noting  that the percentage of olestra snackers suffering side effects in studies was virtually the same as that of the non-olestra snackers suffering side effects. All three stories on the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate reported that most people don't suffer allergic reactions to it. <BR>
<p>

<B>Drinking Water/ Chlorine.</b> Women's magazines also featured many warnings about unsafe drinking water. Unless she were to read one balanced article about risks in the April 23 <I>Woman's Day</I>, a subscriber to these magazines would likely never know that "the American water supply is one of the safest in the world, and outbreaks of contamination ... are very rare." This was the only balanced article of the six articles that dealt with water. The other five were scare-mongering stories that did not even present another side to their points of view. <BR>
 <p>

With titles like "What's in your water?" and "Troubled waters," these articles usually couldn't see the algae for the lake. They vastly overstated drinking water's risks and failed to distinguish the real risks in water systems. For instance, articles in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(November 1995), <I>Parents</I> (March), and <I>Mademoiselle</I> (September) uncritically reported an alarmist study by the Environmental Working Group about agricultural pesticide runoff in water and treated pesticides as if they were as serious a problem as cryptosporidium and other waterborne bacteria. But as agricultural expert Avery has written, "The fact is that field application of pesticides is not contaminating drinking water. The only pesticide residues exceeding good health standards in recent EPA and state surveys have been from known pollution sites." <BR>
<p>

One of the most ironic aspects of the water stories is that they routinely bash chlorine as unsafe, even though chlorine is the chemical that provides the most effective protection against waterborne diseases. Bizarre as it may seem, while the World Health Organization pursues chlorination of the world's drinking water systems as one of its top priorities, the July <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> suggests that Americans stop putting chlorine in their pools! A subheading in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> asked, "Is chlorine bad for you?" <I>Mademoiselle</I> charged that "chlorine, normally a water safety hero because it kills most bacteria, produces cancer-causing by-products." <I>Good Housekeeping </I>did at least quote a scientist who says, "The risk of microbial contamination far outweighs the smaller increased risk of cancer." Yet none of the stories illustrated the risk of not using chlorine by informing readers what happened after Peru stopped chlorinating its water in the early '80s: a cholera epidemic that so far has killed 10,000 people. <BR>
<p>

As for the possible cancer risks of chlorine by-products, the award-winning cancer researcher Bruce Ames of the University of California-Berkeley (who, incidentally, was not quoted in any of the articles) points out that at the levels humans are exposed to, chlorine by-products in tap and swimming pool water are less carcinogenic than peanut butter, which contains the mold aflatoxin. <BR>
<p>

The story that the magazines all issued is that because the federal government issues top-down regulations that cost municipalities up to $37 billion a year (according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute) in chasing small risks such as pesticides and chlorine by-products, the municipalities often don't have the resources or the flexibility to fully pursue larger local risks like cryptosporidium. <BR>
<p>

<B>Passive Smoke.</b> In Graham's survey, almost 80 percent of women believed that environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoke was a serious health hazard, compared with slightly over 60 percent of men who believed this was so. Judging from the coverage of this issue in women's magazines, this may be another case where women's perceptions may be shaped or reinforced by the periodicals they read. Of five articles that covered the alleged health risk of passive smoke, only one featured any skeptical arguments. A December, 1995 <I>Weight Watchers</I> article proclaimed, "Mindful of secondhand-smoke risks, many cities are banning smoking in public places," without ever questioning if the risks were real. An April 23 <I>Woman's Day </I>article entitled "Health Scares: Real or Not" that did a good job of deflating other scares such as dirty water, uncritically accepts the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) estimate that passive smoke causes 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. It is only in a four-page <I>Better Homes & Gardens</I> article that a skeptical view is even presented, and this article spends just two paragraphs quoting a Tobacco Institute spokesman who criticized the EPA and said passive smoke risks are "not even slight." <BR>
<p>

However, none of these articles gave readers a clue that it is not just tobacco industry spokesmen who question the EPA's findings on passive smoke. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service, for one, has concluded that "the statistical record does not appear to support a conclusion that there are substantial health effects of passive smoking." The CRS noted that under circumstances of conventional studies, the EPA's finding "is not statistically significant."  Steve Milloy, president of the Environmental Policy Analysis Network, have noted that even the risk the EPA did find (1.19) is so tiny that some experts don't even consider it a real risk. He notes that there are higher correlations between yogurt and ovarian cancer (2), whole ilk and lung cancer (2.14), and abortion and breast cancer (1.5), than there is between passive smoke and lung cancer. <BR>
<p>

The September <I>Parents</I> ran a one-sided article entitled "Smoking is Child Abuse" that blames passive smoke for a number of childhood illnesses. It quotes Dr. Joseph DiFranza as saying, "A judge should know whether an adult seeking custody of a youngster smokes, so the child isn't placed in an unhealthy environment." However, the article does not note that even DiFranza has acknowledged in a medical journal article that not all studies show these effects. Some researchers also question the notion that passive smoke could cause an illness such as middle ear disease when smoking itself has never been found to cause this illness. An article presenting both sides suggesting caution when smoking around children would have been appropriate, but this article is too one-sided and alarmist in the face of uncertain scientific research. <BR>
<p>

<b>Recycling.</b> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out of 15 articles that mentioned recycling, there was not one skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is impractical and wastes resources. A statement typical of the philosophy of these articles came from an article in the June <I>Better Homes & Gardens</II> </I>that showcased products such as a yardbird made from old garden tools. The article said, "For recycling to be successful, consumers must make the process profitable for manufacturers by purchasing products made from recycled materials." But should manufacturers make recycled products if they're not profitable? Some reporters in the mainstream media are now breaking a taboo and asking this question. An article in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> said that recycling not only is more costly than landfilling, it also is sometimes "a messy way to try to help the environment" and has environmental costs associated with it, citing examples of energy wasted by additional garbage trucks that have to pick up recycled materials. <BR>
<p>

<b>Alcohol.</b> One area where women's magazines have a better record at reporting on  comparative risks is in articles weighing the health benefits of moderate drinking against the hazards of excess drinking. An article in <I>McCall's </I>(May) and two in <I>Good Housekeeping </I>(May and September) reported on the announcement in Department of Agriculture's Dietary Guidelines that moderate consumption of alcohol can lower the risk of heart disease. The articles note, however, that drinking can be hazardous with medications, during pregnancy, or in excess. Unfortunately, another article in <I>Good Housekeeping</I> (August 1996) focuses on the "overlooked dangers" alcohol poses to women without mentioning its health benefits. And a "To Do" article in the January <I>Weight Watchers</I> on hangovers ended by saying, "And remember: Alcohol is a drug, so it's best not to drink in the first place." <BR>
  <p>

<b>Nannyism.</b> The biggest risk issues women's magazine take on have to do with household products. Frequently, there are articles that give good advice about how to select the safest products for children and how to monitor children using these products. However, there is a disturbing tendency in seven articles for the authors to act as a national nanny and preach to readers what they should and shouldn't buy. Articles in <I>Woman's Day</I> (June 4 and Aug. 6) tell mothers not to allow guns to be kept in the house. <I>Woman's Day</I> (Feb. 1) and <I>Parents</I> (March) tell moms not to let kids play with BB guns. In these cases, the authors are not serving their readers by informing of risks, they are crossing the line into substituting their value judgments for those of their readers. Many of these articles also fail to point out that the product isn't as much of a danger as is the lack of parental supervision. For instance, a June 4 <I>Woman's Day</I> article recommended that parents not buy baby walkers because they injured 25,000 children each year. But the article failed to note that according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, over 20,000 children who are not in baby walkers also are injured falling down the stairs each year. A much better article on how to manage risks comes from August <I>Parents</I>. The article describes a possible hazard that may occur when lead in imported miniblinds  breaks down into dust particles and children lick the blinds. But it quotes someone who points out that this can be taken care of by washing the blinds yearly. <BR>
<P> 
<B><I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>'s Valuable Advice.</B> This study reviewed 56 mentions of science and risk issues. Of those, 35 -- more than half -- were completely one-sided and did not even acknowledge a skeptical view. Six include an opposing view but gave it much less ink and discussed it superficially. Only 15 were balanced articles that put risks in perspective by reference to scientific findings.  Clearly, women and families have enough to worry about and don't need new, baseless fears added to their burden. Indeed, many women would be interested in articles that report how much government regulations for tiny risks cost them and their families. The Small Business Administration places the costs of regulation at almost $7000 per household. This cost is passed on to women and families in terms of higher prices and less competition and product innovation. <BR>
<P>
The article that, by far, provided the best overall coverage of health and science issues appeared in the March issue of <I>Ladies' Home Journal</I>. In that article, Alfred Sommer, dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health at  Johns Hopkins University, gave some guidelines to help readers evaluate health claims. Judging from the quality of their articles on risk issues, women's magazine writers should learn some of Sommer's tips as well: <BR>
<P>
"Keep in mind that each study is a piece of a bigger puzzle. View each new finding as an update rather than the final word." <BR>
<P>
"Remember that most studies highlight an association between a behavior characteristic and a health outcome, not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship." <BR>
<P>
"Even when an association between a particular behavior and a health risk is found it doesn't mean one leads to the other." <BR>
<P>
"Finally, consider the size and duration of the study (the larger it is and the longer it ran, the more dependable its findings) and the source of the report." <BR>

<BR>
Reporters consider most risky products newsworthy, but tobacco gets far more coverage than any other risky 
product, including such illegal drugs as cocaine and marijuana. This is one conclusion of a special year-long, 
two-part study of news coverage of risky products. The study, conducted by the Media Research Center's Free
Market Project, analyzes network morning and evening news shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. 
The study found:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Tobacco as a risk problem is overemphasized.</B></a><BR> Tobacco and smoking were the subject of 413 news stories, compared to 136 stories for obesity/fatty foods, 94 for auto safety, and 58 for alcohol. Tobacco even drew more coverage than cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined, which were the subjects of 340 stories.
<P>
<LI><B> The media have allowed the Clinton Administration to use tobacco as a political weapon.</B> </a><BR>President Clinton was the driving force behind a good deal of the tobacco news. Eighty-five stories focused on his efforts to regulate tobacco. Only 45 of the stories about illegal drugs mentioned Clinton, and almost all of these references were positive.
<P>
<LI><B>There is a double standard in coverage of tobacco as a political issue. </B></a><BR>Jack Kemp's flip-flops on affirmative action and immigration were noted in five evening news stories during the 1996 Republican Convention. Al Gore's tobacco flip-flop -- politically exploiting his sister's smoking-related death after having boasted in 1988 about his tobacco farming history -- didn't receive any evening news coverage during the Democratic Convention.
<P>
<LI><B> Anti-tobacco sources far exceed pro-tobacco sources in terms of both quality and quantity.</B></a><BR> Reporters ran soundbites from 270 anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources, compared to 116 from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. They also gave anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources the last word in 132 stories, compared to only 40 for the other side.

<I>Reporters should be skeptical of both the tobacco industry and anti-smoking activists. Currently, they are 
skeptical of only one side -- the tobacco industry. And they should ask themselves: Is tobacco really more

<H3><CENTER>Part I: Tobacco Versus Other Risky Products</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Consumers face risks when they choose to buy and consume certain products. But the news media do not treat all of those risks the same. Tobacco, especially, receives far more total coverage with a far more negative tone than does every other risky product.
This is the finding of a special year-long Media Research Center study of news coverage of risky products and the industries which make and sell them. For the study, Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky products on the morning and evening news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as CNN's World News and World Today shows between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996. Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage by far than any other risky legal product or its maker, such as dietary fat and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry. Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well, even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign.

<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be life-threatening, or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former. Over the twelve-month study period television news has devoted significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
There were 413 stories during the twelve-month study period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite well-documented rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few years, notably among teenagers. It should be noted, too, that many of the stories about illegal drugs were brief anchor-reads about, for instance, the status of football star Michael Irvin's drug trial, not rising drug use.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American newspapers found that the terms "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" were employed 9,067 times between during the study period. Over the same time period, however, the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" were used only 3,875 times. In other words, there were more than twice as many stories focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal drugs.

President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the map. Eighty-five of the television news tobacco stories were about the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry. Almost all of these stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry, portraying him as courageously taking on a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced on the August 11, 1995 Today that "in a historic move the Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers." According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning, "President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco lobby."
<P>
But when the issue was the increased use of illegal drugs, Clinton Administration officials were only mentioned in 45 stories, and most of these references were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals that there were 1,819 stories between August 1, 1995 and July 31, 1996 that had "tobacco or smoking or cigarette" in the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the story. Stories with the terms "cocaine or heroin or LSD or marijuana or illegal drugs" in the headline and a reference to Clinton in the body of the story numbered only 204.
<P>
This media's obvious distaste for tobacco continued after the study period and affected campaign coverage as the 1996 presidential contest heated up. Normally, when a politician radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance, there were five network evening news stories during the 1996 Republican National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the Republican vice-presidential candidate. 
<P>
"The quarterback became the acrobat today," reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August 14, 1996 World News Tonight. "Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She noted that these changes "left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned" and that "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker." According to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration." Rather wondered: "Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?"
<P>
But these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco crusade. None of the networks pointed out that in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that "throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and sold it." There were no stories on the evening news shows during the convention about Gore's change of heart. The same reporters who derided Kemp for changing positions on immigration and affirmative action didn't find Gore's flip-flop on tobacco at all newsworthy.
<P>
<a name="fat">

<BR>
 <H4> Tobacco and Fat</H4>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was an even greater disparity between the number of stories on tobacco and the number on other legal products. On television -- during the same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco -- there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; 94 stories focused on auto safety; only 58 stories were related to alcohol and health.
<P>
The disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000 deaths in the U.S. per year. It would stand to reason, then, that there would be about three-fourths the number of stories on fat and obesity as there were about tobacco. There weren't.
<P>
Reporters acknowledged the riskiness of obesity and dietary fat. "Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country," NBC's Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. "It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS' Jacqueline Adams reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<P>
One reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one high-fat meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. McKenzie told viewers about a University of Marylyand study  in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<P>
While reporters acknowledged this riskiness, they didn't give the risk of obesity and dietary fat nearly the same amount of coverage they gave to tobacco. There were only about one-fourth the number of stories about obesity and fat as there were stories about tobacco, even though obesity contributes to three-fourths as many deaths each year as tobacco.
<P>
<a name="complain">

<H4>Complaints Against Tobacco</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
There was also a different standard of judgment for the industries that make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured. There were no stories, for example, about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol. But the networks were all critical of tobacco advertising and campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society of smoking-related illnesses.
<P>
In stories about advertising, the assumption was clear: Cunning tobacco advertising entices unwitting youngsters into lifelong addiction to tobacco. ABC's Nancy Snyderman, for instance, reported "that 12-18 year-olds are in fact most influenced by [tobacco] advertising...and obviously we know that the earlier you smoke, the more addicted you are, the harder it is to break. So I think it's one more indication that advertising works."
<P>
But there are those both inside and outside the tobacco and advertising industries who question how effective -- and how constitutional -- proposed regulations on tobacco advertising could be. "How will banning tobacco ads possibly discourage smoking?" asked columnist James K. Glassman in the August 27, 1996 Washington Post. "LSD use rose 183 percent between 1992 and 1995, and I haven't seen any LSD ads recently." Such arguments were rarely heard on television news.
<P>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<P>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27, 1996 CBS Evening News, told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On the same night, NBC's Bob Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." Industry -- especially tobacco industry -- contributions were all reporters cared about. The political contributions of trial lawyers or unions sparked little media interest.
<P>
Second-hand smoke was the focus of twelve stories. Reporters were much more likely to cover studies showing that second-hand smoke leads to health problems in non-smokers than they were to cover studies which questioned such data. Example: A November 14, 1995 Congressional Research Service study, while not declaring passive smoke to be safe, questioned some of the numbers put forward by second-hand smoke critics. The number of stories on the CRS study -- zero.
<P>
Reporters often mistook experts on health and medicine for experts on public policy. Bob Kur, on the April 9, 1996 Today, introduced viewers to a doctor who studied the effects of second-hand smoke on children. Kur didn't show any skepticism toward the doctor when he recommended that "smoking be banned wherever children are present and even suggests smoking be considered in child custody cases and foster home placements. With tobacco under increasing assault, [Dr.] DiFranza also believes a study like his could prompt a class-action lawsuit on behalf of children." Kur didn't allow other views into his story, such as the view that separating children from their smoking parents is a bit extreme or the view that much tobacco litigation is frivolous.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more stories on tobacco than on other legal risky products, but they have allowed the Clinton administration to use smoking to deflect public attention from rising illegal drug use. Responsible reporters should not ignore tobacco, but they should not apply to it a standard which is harsher even than the standard they apply to illegal drugs.

<H3><CENTER>Part II: Sources</CENTER></H3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
One subtle, but powerful, form of bias in the media has to do with selection and placement of soundbites from sources. The most obvious display of source bias is when reporters interview or use sources only from one side of an issue. Sometimes, however, a story is biased even when reporters have conscientiously produced soundbites from both sides. One side may consistently get the last word in a story, thereby giving it an edge. Or reporters may interview sources from one side that will be credible in the eyes of viewers and less credible sources from the other. In the case of tobacco reporting during the year-long study period, every one of these biases was present.
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<a name="number">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Number of Soundbites</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#content">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
 In stories about tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions from tobacco companies, and second-hand smoke, there were more than twice as many soundbites from those opposed to the tobacco industry than from those either supporting tobacco or opposing government regulation. In such stories, there were 270 soundbites from anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources. There were only 116 soundbites from pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources. In many stories, only anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were presented.
<P>
Example: The introductory story for the May 23, 1996 CBS Evening News. The story was about a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry that had just been thrown out of court and a new study which indicated that smoking had increased among young blacks. Correspondent Jim Stewart's story included a soundbite about the lawsuit from John Banzhaf, an anti-smoking activist, who said: "I think this is a significant setback for the victims, but it is not a reprieve for the tobacco industry. We'll simply bring the cases in state court rather than federal court." He also interviewed Rep. John Lewis about tobacco sales to black teens. "I think there has been a deliberate, systematic effort on the part of the tobacco industry to target black teenagers." Stewart noted that many blamed advertising for the increase in smoking. He didn't make room in his story for comments from those who think tobacco lawsuits are frivolous, or from those who think advertising doesn't explain teen smoking behavior.
<a name="word">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Getting the Last Word</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The last soundbite in a story is often the most important. The exeprt who is quoted last often gets the chance to refute the best argument presented from the other side. In the stories about tobacco, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the opportunity to speak last more than three times as often pro-tobacco or anti-regulation sources. In 132 stories, most of which were about either lawsuits or proposed regulations, anti-tobacco/pro-regulation sources were given the last word. In 40 stories, pro-tobacco/anti-regulation sources were given the last word.
<P>
In one typical story, CBS's Bill Plante first ran a soundbite from Bill Clinton arguing that further regulation of tobacco is necessary because "cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are harmful, highly addictive, and aggressively marketed to our young people." He then ran a soundbite from "tobacco-state lawmaker" Wendell Ford, who said: "The administration has chosen litigation over compromise." Plante's next soundbite was from Clinton arguing that voluntary measures won't work: "First of all, there'd be no way to enforce it. Secondly, the history of voluntary agreements with the tobacco industry is not good, to put it mildly." Steve Parrish of Philip Morris, then told viewers: "Make no mistake, the real issue and the real agenda here is prohibition." Plante's final soundbite was from FDA Commissioner David Kessler, who said the issue was solely about children: "If you don't start smoking by 18 or 19, you don't start smoking."
<P>
In each case, Plante let soundbites from Clinton Administration sources counter whatever arguments anti-regulation spokesmen brought up, without giving the anti-regulation side the same courtesy.
<a name="credible">
<P>
<BR>
<H4> Credibility of Sources</H4>
<P>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
In the stories about tobacco, television news reporters almost always went to anti-smoking sources that would likely be more credible in the eyes of viewers than the sources interviewed on the pro-tobacco/anti-regulation side. An August 3, 1995 CNN World News story about President Clinton's attempts to regulate the industry is an example. Correspondent Wolf Blitzer first ran a soundbite from President Clinton, who asserted that the best way to improve the health and health care of Americans is to stop teen smoking.
<P>
Then Blitzer ran a soundbite from George Dessart of the American Cancer Society. "Trusting the tobacco industry to set and enforce the same limits voluntarily," argued Dessart, "flies in the face of the industry's record, of its best interests, and of its motives." Blitzer then allowed the Tobacco Institute's Walker Merryman a chance to respond: "If the Food & Drug Administration gets involved in tobacco regulation there can be only one result, and that's a ban on the product." Finally, Blitzer ran a soundbite from North Carolina Representative Charlie Rose, who asked, "Why not take the word of the cigarette companies that they will join in a government partnership to keep tobacco products away from kids?"
<P>
Is this balance? Blitzer interviewed two sources from each side of the regulatory debate, and he even gave an anti-regulation congressman the last word. But both of those featured on the anti-regulation side of the debate had a personal interest in opposing regulations. This, of course, didn't make what they had to say wrong, but it certainly would taint their opinions in the eyes of viewers, unlike the source affiliated with the American Cancer Society. Blitzer should have also interviewed an expert, perhaps from a university psychology or marketing department, who would have questioned the efficacy of regulations on advertising.
<P>
In some cases reporters cannot be expected to find credible sources on both sides. For example, balance does not require reporters to find and interview scientists who claim that smoking is not risky behavior. But on such issues as tobacco regulation, tobacco advertising, tobacco lawsuits, campaign contributions by the tobacco industry, and second-hand smoke, there is a real debate with independent experts arguing, for instance, against the regulation of tobacco and against lawsuits aimed at the tobacco industry.
<P>
Usually the only people opposing tobacco regulations who were interviewed were those with a vested interest in stopping regulations, such as tobacco-industry spokesmen or tobacco-state politicians. Such sources should be interviewed. But they are not the only ones who oppose increased regulation. Other disinterested experts should be interviewed as well. Reporters who don't interview credible experts on both sides of such issues are not giving their viewers the entire story.

<p></center>
In every recent presidential election the media have tilted their coverage toward the liberal nominee. One poll by the  <!--a href="/may96pg1.html"-->Freedom Forum found 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Bill Clinton in '92. 
<p>
We fully expect the media to again portray Congressional Republicans as out-of-touch extremists and the Democratic incumbents as mainstream moderates. 
<p>
The Democrats will portray themselves as the last defense against a takeover of the presidency and Congress by far-right extremists out to destroy 
the environment, starve the poor, and throw the elderly on the
 streets.
  The media will let them get away with this by failing to highlight Clinton's liberal policies. 
<p>
To neutralize this bias, the MRC launched a $2.8 million effort to expose liberal media bias during the 1996 election campaign. Read <a href="/mrc/reality/pcspeech.html">Chairman L. Brent Bozell's</a> speech.
<p>
<a href="/mrc/reality/realchek.html">Media Reality Check '96</a> will counter the media's liberal spin through our comprehensive media database of network news stories, our newsletters 
<a href="/mrc/mediawatch/welcome.html"><b>MediaWatch</b></a>, 
<a href="/mrc/nq/welcome.html"><b>Notable Quotables</b></a>, and 
<a href="/mrc/medianomics/welcome.html"><b>MediaNomics</b></a>, and our new book 
<a href="/mrc/bookstore/welcome.html"><b>Pattern of Deception</b></a>
, proving the media's pro-Clinton bias. 
<p>
In addition, several new projects are now or will soon be available on-line:
<p><ul>
<li>Two-page Media Reality Check '96 updates will be periodically 
sent via <a href="/mrc/reality/pressrel.html"><b>Fax Reports</b></a>
 to a list of over 1,500 media, political, public policy and grassroots contacts around the country, documenting examples of biased coverage and detailing study results proving bias.
<p>
<li>A daily <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/conv96.html"><b> Media Reality Check</b></a> newsletter to be distributed to delegates, talk show hosts, and reporters at the Republican Convention in San Diego and the Democratic Convention in Chicago. Through e-mail, faxes and on-site delivery in San Diego, we'll get our evidence distributed to talk show hosts, columnists, editorial writers, and reporters across the country.
 <p>
<li><a href="/mrc/cyberalert/welcome.html"><b>CyberAlerts</b></a> on campaign bias: Several times a week we'll deliver e-mail alerts on the latest biased quotes and trends to reporters, talk show hosts, columnists, and conservative activists. To sign up for CyberAlerts, send your e-mail address to <a href="mailto:mrc@mediaresearch.org">mrc@mediaresearch.org</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Press releases</b> will announce study findings, provide our reaction to bias as it occurs, and give warning shots to reporters before major events, telling them how to avoid biased coverage. 
<p>
<li><b>Convention Guide to the Media</b> will be distributed at the conventions to show through past quotes which reporters have been naughty or nice. 
<p>
<li><b>MRC Merchandise</b>: Bumper stickers, pens and magnets boldly displaying our message "I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media!" will be distributed to delegates at the national conventions and to the public.

<center><h1>The Media's Coverage of Election Night '96</h1></center>
<P>
<P>
<I><B>November 6, 1996:  MRC analysts are working furiously to get you the latest liberal bias spouted by the media on election night and during the post-election coverage.  MRC <a href="/mrc/cyberalert/">CyberAlerts</a>, studies, and reports will soon be released. Until then, here's the tip of the iceberg of the Election Night '96 coverage:</I></B><P>
<P>
<P>

NBC <I>Today</I>'s Matt Lauer to RNC Chairman Haley Barbour, 11/6/96:<BR>  
"Mr. Barbour, exit polls show us that the economy was still the number one issue on people's mind last night.  And although character and trust play a role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues.  With that in mind, what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, hey, move forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White House?"<BR>
<P>

CBS<I> This Morning</I>'s Troy Roberts, 11/6/96: <BR> 
"The pundits had written his political obituary, but last night Newt Gingrich oversaw a victory, just barely, as voters ratified the two-year-old revolution that changed the face of Congress.  The party retains control of the House, despite discouraging poll figures about its leader..."<BR>
<P>

ABC's David Brinkley talking to Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts, Jeff Greenfield, Lynn Sherr, Hal Bruno and Peter Jennings during the final minutes of <I>The '96 Vote</I>, 11/6/96: <BR>
"OK, fine, I'm not going to say much.  Among things I admire, almost near the top is creativeness, and everyone in this group has it.  It shows in your work, it shows in your thinking, and it shows in your speech, what you do, what you write, what you say, and it's one reason this group is so terrific.  Bill Clinton has none of it, he has not a creative bone in his body.  Therefore, he's a bore and will always be a bore."<BR>
<P>
<P>
More coverage coming soon!  <BR>

<center><h1> Statement of L. Brent Bozell III <BR>
Chairman, Media Research Center </h1></center>
<center><h3> <a href="http://www.conservative.org">ACU Press Conference</a><BR>
November 6, 1996</h3></center>
<P>
<P>
	In 1990 a group of conservative leaders - some present today - publicly predicted George Bush would lose his campaign for re-election because his administration had abandoned the mission of the Reagan revolution.  As the '92 campaign unfolded , and the lackluster, issue-less Bush campaign limped through the summer and fall, it became evident our prediction would be correct.<BR>
<P>

	Bob Dole had two diametrically opposite strategies to choose from this year.  Follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan with a conservative agenda outlining not just a vision of, but a specific agenda for, a limited government, a strong national defense and a commitment to family values - a strategy that led to two landslide elections; or follow in the footsteps of Bush, with  no vision,  and virtually no message.  It was stunning to see Dole for months reject the Reagan message, and adopt the Bush non-agenda.  And when, in the final days, he decided to move to the right, Dole, like Bush in '92, closed the gap.  But like Bush in '92, it was too little too late. <BR>
<P>

	Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  Santayana would have made for a good political pundit this year. <BR>
<P>

	But there was another similarity.  In both campaigns, the GOP nominee made the same terrible miscalculation, assuming the national media, particularly the networks, would report on the elections in a fair and balanced manner. <BR>
<P>

	In 1992, Bill Clinton presented himself to America as a "New Democrat" and embraced a strongly conservative agenda in his campaign.  It was a farce, and those who knew this man's record said so.  The media, however, were silently, refusing to expose the charade - and no one was surprised when Clinton immediately launched a left-wing agenda in 1993, abandoning promise after campaign promise.  Also in 1992, reporters, contrary to the conventional mythology perpetrated by so many in the press, barely touched numerous Clinton scandals; some, like Whitewater, were ignored completely by the networks throughout the entirety of the campaign. <BR>
<P>

	Remarkably, Clinton pulled it off again this year.  After his Big Government agenda was so decisively rejected after two years, Clinton announced the era of Big Government was dead - and then took responsibility for it.  What followed in this campaign was dishonesty after dishonestly, twisting the facts, distorting the truth, even claiming on national television to stand in favor of issue after issue that he had, in fact, actively opposed!  But what made this situation even worse, the so-called Truth Squads in the media, again particularly on the networks, simply took a pass, and refused to expose the dishonesty. <BR>
<P>
 

	But where the coverage of ethical scandals was concerned, the record this year from the networks was simply abominable.  At this moment the Media Research Center is analyzing every single network news story in the past four years to determine how many Clinton scandals, or major developments within them, were completely ignored by the networks, either on their evening news or their morning news programs.  Having seen the initial data, I can tell you that when this report is released in a couple of weeks, the American public will be absolutely shocked at the sheer number of scandals covered up by the networks. <BR>
<P>

	The next few months will tell the story.  If in that period Clinton delivers on his campaign promises - tax cuts, a balanced budget, reduced federal government, a strong national defense, a ban on partial birth abortions,  support for the institution of marriage, school choice; and if the literally dozens of scandals swirling around this administration in general, and the Clintons in particular, all prove to be groundless as this administration contends, then there really is a Tooth Fairy.  But if Clinton returns to his left-wing agenda while the indictments begin to fly, no one standing here will be shocked; and the American public is going to demand to know why the networks did not report what they knew was going to happen.  I will be one of those demanding an answer. <BR>
<P>

<h2>MEDIA REALITY CHECK BLAST</h2>


Whitewater: The Story Reporters Loved to Hate
<p>

ALEXANDRIA, VA. &#173;&#173; In a study of nearly three months of network and news magazine coverage, the Media Research Center found that despite the suggestion that
the national media's only bias is in favor of &quot;a good story,&quot; the Whitewater story &#173;&#173; indictments, convictions, Senate hearings, and all &#173;&#173; is still the story reporters love to hate. The lack of coverage is matched by the disparaging tone members of the media have displayed toward Whitewater over the past few months. A representative sampling of these follows on page two.
<p>

First, among the study findings:<p>

From February 29 to May 20, the four TV evening news shows aired only 23 reporter&#173;based stories on Whitewater in more than 11 weeks. Only 13 reports came from the Big Three, compared to ten stories on CNN's The World Today.
Eleven of the 23 stories focused on the President's testimony.
<p>
The most stunning lack of coverage came from NBC Nightly News, which aired only one reporter&#173;based story in the entire 11 weeks &#173;&#173; on May 9.
<p>
The three network morning shows aired only 14 reporter&#173;based stories and five interviews in 11 weeks. Again, much of the coverage (nine of the 14 stories and
two of the five interviews) concerned Clinton's testimony.
<p>
None of the magazine shows covered the trial &#173;&#173; but then, from 1992 forward, all of the magazine shows combined have aired only two reporter&#173;based stories
on Whitewater. 
<p>
Although Time carried a long cover story excerpting James Stewart's Whitewater book Blood Sport, the news magazines devoted fewer pages to the Whitewater trial than they
did to the Jackie Onassis auction. In their May 6 editions, Time made the auction their cover story and gave it eight pages, Newsweek devoted six pages, U.S. News, two.

<p>
Some significant stories the networks barely or never covered: 

<p>
On February 29 and again on March 7, Senate Democrats blocked votes extending the tenure of the Senate Whitewater Committee. The Democrats held up further hearings until agreeing to a deal on April 18. One reporter&#173;based story on ABC's World News Tonight (and anchor briefs on ABC's Good Morning America and CNN) were the only coverage of the Democratic filibuster until the hearings resumed April 24.
<p>
On March 15, a federal appeals court removed Judge Henry Woods from a related case against Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and reinstated four fraud counts struck down by Woods,
finding the judge was too close to the Clintons. Despite several network stories and an entire Nightline on the credibility of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the networks never covered the Woods story.                        
<p>
On March 24, an ABC News/Washington Post poll announced 52 percent of respondents believed the First Lady was not telling the truth about Whitewater and 49 percent said
they believe she acted illegally. While the Post published the poll, buried on page A16, ABC never reported it. 

<p>
When word leaked on April 29 that the FBI found Hillary Clinton's fingerprints on the long&#173;missing Rose Law Firm documents discovered in the White House, it drew
only four anchor&#173;read briefs.Second, there's a good reason why Whitewater has received so little coverage: Many reporters don't think it's worth covering or that it's been over covered.
<p>
Check out these recent quotes:
<p>
On Friday's Washington Week in Review (May 24) on PBS they discussed the RNC ad attacking Clinton for invoking the Soldier and Sailors' Act, prompting New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman to note the ad was created &quot;Right when Whitewater seems to be grinding to a halt as a legal issue.&quot; A few minutes later, moderator Ken Bode (also a CNN analyst), offered his view of why Republicans decided to run the ad: &quot;Whitewater is sort of diminishing, sort of fading away, it's kind of a shadowy
thing now, it's going away.&quot; 
<p>
Steve Roberts of U.S. News &amp; World Report, on C&#173;SPAN's Washington Journal, May 16: &quot;This kind of call which says, 'You're all liberals,' haven't been listening, they haven't been reading. Anybody, anybody, it seems to me, who
gives a fair reading, Brian [Lamb], of the press coverage of Bill Clinton's first three years, cannot say that the press has been easy on Bill Clinton. The press has beaten the hell out of Bill Clinton over and over again, and Whitewater, which that caller mentions, is just one example and day after day coverage of that issue, which is legitimate and should be there.&quot;

<p>
Time columnist Margaret Carlson and U.S. News &amp; World Report Editor&#173;in&#173;Chief Mort Zuckerman on CNBC's Cal Thomas show, March 24, 1996: 
<p>
Carlson: &quot;It's [Whitewater] out there, it's been out there, it's not going to have any more impact than it's already having.&quot; 
<p>
Zuckerman: &quot;I don't think there's anything there unless Kenneth Starr does come up with anything, and the fact that there is a trial going on I think is not going to be relevant to what the elections going to be all about, you can't run an election based on attacking the President's wife.&quot;

<p>
Eleanor Clift of Newsweek on The McLaughlin Group, February 10, 1996: &quot;If Ken Starr is a credible prosecutor he will bring this to a conclusion and the Clintons will be exonerated.&quot;

<p>
Margaret Carlson, Time magazine columnist and former White House reporter, on CNN's Capital Gang, December 23, 1995: &quot;As the curtains keep getting lifted there's nothing there! There's no big, you know, there's no big smoking gun. There's no magilla! And they keep going and not finding anything.&quot;

</center>
<p>  
<hr width=10% align=center>
<CENTER><I>MRC Alert: Nets Play Catch-Up; Broder from the Left; Clinton the Forgiver?</I></CENTER>
<ol>
<li><a href="#1"> Monday night ABC and CBS aired Democratic fundraising stories
highlighting information reported in newspapers weeks or months
earlier.</A>
<li><a href="#2"> Washington Post reporter David Broder's plea to the Governor of
NH: "Are the kids not worth having a sales tax or an income tax?"</a>
<li><a href="#3"> NBC's Today suggests that Bill Clinton is popular because he
"forgives and accepts" the public's excesses and frailties.</a>
</ol>
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) The networks keep playing catch-up on Clinton scandals
reported weeks or months ago in the print media. World News
Tonight, which still hasn't uttered a syllable on the White House
database story, Monday night devoted two pieces to Democratic
fundraising. First, Linda Douglass reported how top Clinton aide
Harold Ickes sent a memo to a potential donor suggesting how he
direct his promised $5 million donation.
<p>
<dd>
Second, John Donvan took viewers through the developing coffee
meetings story. He noted: "Now there are questions about how some
of the guests at these and other functions ever got through the
White House gates. The Clinton administration appears to have
dropped screening procedures used by the Reagan and Bush White
Houses to keep the wrong sorts of people from getting in. People
like Eric Wynn, a stock promoter reported this weekend to be
linked to the Bonanno crime family and who served two years in
prison for securities fraud. Others include, Wang Jun, one of
China's leading arms merchants, Gregory Loutchansky, head of a
company said to be tied to the Russian mafia. And Jorge Cabrera
who was convicted of drug charges after contributing $20,00 to the
Democratic Party..."
<p>
<dd>
Not exactly groundbreaking revelations, except to ABC viewers.
While World News Tonight did air a story on Cabrera last October,
they ignored the others when uncovered by other outlets:
<br>
<dd>
-- Eric Wynn's role was revealed in the February 1 Washington
Post, but not reported by ABC that night.
<br>
<dd>
-- Wang Jun's attendance became known on December 20 and Bill
Clinton was asked about it at a press conference that day. World
News Tonight: no story. On January 29 The Washington Times
discovered that on the day Wang Jun visited the White House the
man who helped him get a U.S. visa donated $50,000 to the DNC.
World News Tonight: no story.
<br>
<dd>
-- Gregory Loutchansky's attendance was uncovered by the
Associated Press on November 3. World News Tonight: no mention.
<p>
<dd>
On the CBS Evening News Monday night (February 3), Phil Jones
offered a lengthy piece on John Huang's possible involvement in
economic espionage as he got numerous top secret briefings and
maintained his security clearance months after he left the
Commerce Department. Of course, these charges weren't reported by
CBS when raised in the January 16 Los Angeles Times and January 30
Washington Times. 
<p>
<dd>
Continuing its policy of shying away from Democratic scandal
stories, Monday's NBC Nightly News didn't include a fundraising
story.
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) Sunday's Meet the Press (February 2) featured the
nation's two female Governors. Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New
Hampshire and Republican Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey are
from different parties, but Washington Post reporter David Broder
pressed them both from the same platform -- a liberal one. 
<br>
<dd>
Broder's first question: "Governor Shaheen, you've said that
you want kindergarten available for every child in your state. And
you're proposing to finance it with higher cigarette taxes and
more gambling in the state. I guess you have to do that because
you've locked yourself away from calling for any sales tax or
income tax in New Hampshire. Are the kids not worth having a sales
tax or an income tax?"
<br>
<dd>
Broder's second question: "Governor Whitman, welfare, big
issue for Governors and you've won the big battle because you now
are in control of it. I noticed in one of the news stories about
your new budget that you're proposing to cut county welfare
authorities by ten million dollars. Those are the folks who
actually deal face to face with welfare clients. Now they are
supposed to be the ones who help move those people off welfare,
into jobs. Why in the world would you be cutting their money?"
<p>
<dd>
Note it's "their" money, not the taxpayer's.
<p>
<dd>
Broder's third question went again to Whitman: "I read in the
paper this morning that you had backed off now on asking Congress
to re-open the welfare bill to take care of legal immigrants, who
they are now cutting off. Why would you back off of that?"
<p>
<dd>
You get the idea. But Broder isn't the only Post staffer upset
by welfare reform. E.J. Dionne, a former New York Times and
Washington Post reporter who now pens a column for the Post,
asserted in his January 31 offering:
<br>
<dd>
"Mary Jo Bane, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human
Services until she quit, rightly thought the President was wrong
in signing the welfare 'reform' bill. She described the problem
well in an interview with Post reporters Judith Havemann and
Barbara Vobejda: 'Poor people tend to be concentrated in certain
areas of states that don't have the resources to take care of
them.'"
<br>
<dd>
Dionne's answer: "If we were serious about welfare reform," he
argued, "we'd have the federal government put up the money
required to support our poorest families and to create jobs," and
"we'd funnel some money" to voluntary and church groups.  
<p>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Tuesday night President Clinton will deliver his State of
the Union address. As you observe how the television network
commentators analyze his speech, see if any top a bit of network
veneration noticed by MRC news analyst Geoffrey Dickens. The day
before the Inauguration, on the January 19 Today show, NPR's Scott
Simon explained Clinton's popularity:
<br>
<dd>
"It might fit better to see President Clinton as a 1950's
American car salesmen. Selling image as much as engines. Saying,
'If you don't like blue I can sell you tan. And if you don't like
tan I'll call it Aztec Gold.' And like all great salesmen a man
who believes that the torch can be passed in a handshake. [video
of young Clinton meeting John F. Kennedy] Now just two years ago
the public wasn't buying Bill Clinton's product line. But then the
new Speaker committed the classic mistake of success. He expanded
too fast. Declaring a revolution instead of a simple victory.
Capturing control of the government only to shut it down. Whatever
you feel about Newt Gingrich or Bill Clinton as political leaders
which man would most Americans choose to sit next to on the long
bus trip? The man who prattles on about putting a supercomputer in
every lap or the one who can talk about both Helmut Kohl and
Heartbreak Hotel..."
<br>
<dd>
Simon picked up a minute later: "As he begins his second term
you may lament that President Clinton leaves little eloquence. But
in an age of focus groups and consultants saying, 'Keep it short.
Don't take sides,' few politicians do. He faces personal charges
about his conduct in a motel bedroom. And ethical allegations
about opening the Lincoln bedroom to the highest contributor. But
you come back to the fact that if Bill Clinton isn't always
trusted he has twice been entrusted by the largest responsibility
we have to bestow by voters who can have few illusions. Instead
they seem to trust that as President Clinton displays his own
excesses and frailties he forgives and accepts ours too. This is
Scott Simon."
<p>
<dd>
I'm trying to choke back my tears now that I know he feels my 
pain. And forgives it.
<p>

</ol>
<p>
<A NAME="1">
<dd>
1) "Secret System Computerizes Personal Data," declared a
front page June 26, 1996 article in The Washington Times. Reporter
Paul Rodriquez detailed how the White House Office Data Base
(WHODB) tracked personal information on those who visited the
Clintons, including their DNC donation records.
<br>
<dd>
Network coverage? Not a word on ABC, CBS or NBC. Nor on CNN's
10pm ET The World Today. But, CNN's Inside Politics that day did
carry a full story from Claire Shipmam.
<p>
<dd>
Seven months later, the February 3 Time magazine, out January
27, ran a story headlined "A Secret Cash Link: A White House
Operation that Tracked Donors Was Extensive, Top Secret and Pushed
by the First Lady." On January 30 the Los Angeles Times reported
on its front page that though the government-owned database could
be legally used only for official purposes, "the White House staff
frequently retrieved data on large political contributors and
turned it over to the Democratic National Committee to help raise
money for the President's re-election, interviews show." 
<p>
<dd>
Finally, seven months and four days after The Washington Times
broke the story, the night the LA Times story appeared the
database drew broadcast network attention, but only from two of
the three networks.
<p>
<dd>
The January 30 NBC Nightly News devoted its "Fleecing of
America" segment to the database. Reporter Lisa Myers filed a
tough report that highlighted some Hollywood celebrities:
<br>
<dd>
"...White House documents obtained by NBC News show the
database was conceived as a political tool, as a way to keep track
of early supporters. Hollywood mogul David Geffen is listed as an
early financial supporter, which means he gave money during the
'92 primary, and as a Democratic National Committee trustee, which
means he gave the party at least $100,000. He was invited to 16
White House functions. Diva Barbra Streisand also is listed as a
DNC trustee. She was invited to nine events..."
<br>
<dd>
Myers later noted: "A non-partisan expert on campaign ethics
says the White House crossed the line."
<br>
<dd>
Charles Lewis, Center for Public Integrity: "This is beyond
the pale. Everyone knows this is improper. There's no way to put a
happy spin on this."
<br>
<dd>
Myers: "The White House tried to keep the database secret. An
early memo to Hillary Clinton, who pushed the project hard, noted
that precautions should be taken or the database would be open to
public scrutiny and inquiry....The White House refuses to allow
congressional investigators examine the database even though
taxpayers paid for it. So for now we do know it's another fleecing
of America. But we don't know which contributors slept upstairs in
the Lincoln Bedroom because their names appeared downstairs and
across the way in a secret computer."
<p>
<dd>
On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced: "Questions keep
coming about the way Democrats bankrolled the Clinton re-election
campaign. Republicans have again attacked the White House for
using a database containing 350,000 names. The Republicans say
that this was a blatant fundraising operation and that taxpayers
were stuck with a $1.7 million tab to create it. Correspondent
Rita Braver reports why that could be a problem for President
Clinton."
<p>
<dd>
Of course, it would have been more of a problem if reported
last June.
<p>
<dd>
Braver concluded by noting Hillary Clinton's role, but gave
her the last word: "....Now the documents we obtained showed that
the First Lady personally pushed hard for this system. And at a
meeting with a few reporters today on another subject, she
confirmed that. She also insisted she only wanted something to
track who came to official White House functions. Dan."
<p>
<dd>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't air a piece, but did do a
story on the Friday, January 31 Good Morning America. How about
World News Tonight Friday night? No story, nor one Saturday
or Sunday.
<p>
<A NAME="2">
<dd>
2) The database stories aired Thursday night, but CBS and
NBC immediately dropped the subject. Not another word about the
database on the CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News through
Sunday night.  
<p>
<dd>
It's not the only revelation the networks are failing to
pursue. On January 30 the Associated Press reported that "a former
banker who is a fugitive from Lebanon on embezzlement charges
sipped coffee at the White House with President Clinton and other
Democratic donors last April." Coverage: a story on CNN, but
nothing on the broadcast network evening shows.
<p>
<dd>
The Saturday, February 1 Washington Post revealed that "a New
Jersey stock promoter, convicted of criminal securities fraud that
benefitted a member of the Bonanno organized crime family, was
among eight guests who accepted an invitation to join President
Clinton and top Democratic Party leaders for an early morning
coffee four days before Christmas in 1995."
<br>
<dd>
CBS Evening News anchor Paula Zahn read a brief item on this
revelation, but ABC's World News Saturday? No story. On Sunday's
Meet the Press host Tim Russert noted that "The headline in The
Washington Post today: 'White House Says Felon Not an Appropriate
Guest.' I think this is going to give Senator Thompson an awful
lot of ammunition." So how did NBC play this "ammunition"? No
mention on Nightly News either Saturday or Sunday. 
<p>
<A NAME="3">
<dd>
3) Michael Weisskopf wrote the Time magazine story on the
database. Weisskopf recently jumped to Time from The Washington
Post where he had become infamous for a paragraph in a 1993 news
story he wrote. It won the "Dumbest Quote of the Year" Award in
the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1993: The Sixth Annual Awards
for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
<dd>
In a February 1, 1993 Washington Post story Weisskopf
asserted: "Corporations pay public relations firms millions pf
dollars to contrive the kind of grass-roots response that [Jerry]
Falwell or Pat Robertson can galvanize in a televised sermon.
Their followers are largely poor, uneducated, and easy to command."
<p>
<A NAME="4">
<dd>
4) Friday night (January 31) Dan Rather told CBS Evening
News viewers:
<br>
<dd>
"Encouraging news tonight about the U.S. economy. The
government says the economy grew two and a half percent last year.
That's considered an ideal, non-inflationary growth rate."
<p>
<dd>
Not quite the gloomy spin CBS offered in 1992 when a higher
GDP rate of 2.7 percent was announced. On October 27, 1992 Susan
Spencer filed from the Bush campaign: "He crowed today at upbeat
news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though some
economists warned that may not hold." Spencer was correct, but not
in the direction she thought: the GDP was later revised upward to
3.9 percent.
<p>
<A NAME="5">
<dd>
5) A caller to C-SPAN's Washington Journal on Friday morning
asked Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes about liberal media bias in
coverage of Bill Clinton. She responded by claiming the bias is
not with reporters but with viewers. Here's her response, as
transcribed by MRC news analyst Jim Forbes:
<p>
<dd>
"I was about to say that if you want to talk about bias go ask
President Clinton where the bias lies. As you know, the White
House just issued this big huge study, they called it, of how the
main line media is sucked in by the right wing conspiratorialists.
My point is that everybody who watches television brings their own
biases to it, and if what you're watching doesn't please you then
you think we're biased. 
<br>
<dd>
"Everybody dislikes the messenger, everybody complains about
us, right wing, left wing, Democrats, Republicans, they all pound
on us, they all think we're unfair to them if we're telling them
things they don't want to hear. And we do the best we can, we try
to be fair, there are always issues where an individual reporter
does have a point of view. If he or she is a good journalist and
does his or her job the way they are supposed to then the piece
will come out as balanced as is humanly possible and the
individuals' leanings won't come through. I'm sure there are cases
where a piece is slanted, but I think generally the effort and the
end product, overall, is balanced with everybody being happy with
the way things come out."

6) MRC news analyst Clay Waters noticed this contradictory
reporting just hours apart on CNN. On the January 22 Inside
Politics Candy Crowley reported:
<br>
<dd>
Crowley: "And the hearing on Andrew Cuomo's nomination as
Housing Secretary was practically breathless."
<br>
<dd>
Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD): "This is a sterling choice by the
President."
<br>
<dd>
Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-NC): "You have, certainly have an
impressive record and an impressive group of friends."
<br>
<dd>
Crowley: "It should all be so easy."
<p>
<dd>
Maybe it wasn't so easy. Six hours later CNN anchor Kathleen
Kennedy announced on The World Today: "Senate confirmation for two
of President Clinton's other Cabinet appointees may not be so
easy. Housing Secretary nominee Andrew Cuomo was grilled for three
hours on the state of Housing and Urban Development. The
Department is under congressional fire for alleged inefficiency
and wastefulness."
<p>
<dd>
While on the contrast beat, compare these January 31
headlines. 
<br>
<dd>
The Washington Post -- "Saudis May Purchase U.S. F-16
Fighters: Bethesda's Lockheed Martin in Line for Multibillion-Dollar 
Deal."
<br>
<dd>
The Washington Times -- "F-16 Sale to Saudis Isn't in the
Works, White House Says."
<p>
<A NAME="7">
<dd>
7) "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" became a well-known
phrase in media circles, and the title of a R.E.M. song, after Dan
Rather claimed that's what a man on a Manhattan street yelled at
him during a 1986 assault. The incident added to Rather's image as
a man on the edge, just about to go nuts. Thursday's USA Today
recalled that Rather's story of being mugged "was greeted with
widespread incredulity." Well, it may well be that Rather's tale
was actually true.
<br>
<dd>
The Wednesday January 29 New York Daily News revealed that
Rather looked at pictures of William Tager, a man now serving 25
years for shooting to death an NBC technician outside NBC's
studios in 1994, and identified Tager as his assailant. A forensic
psychiatrist, who examined Tager, first made the connection and
alerted Rather.
<p>
<dd>
Before you think that means Rather is perfectly rational,
remember what he said election night: "In New Hampshire, closest
Senate race in the country, this race between Dick Swett and Bob
Smith is hot and tight as a too small bathing suit on a too long
car ride back from the beach."

[Correction: The January 27 CyberAlert twice quoted members of
the media citing Nellie Bligh as a model for undercover reporting.
It's Bly, not Bligh. Nellie Bly was the byline for Elizabeth
Cochrane, a crusading reporter in the late 1800s for Joseph
Pulitzer's The World newspaper in New York City.]
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) NBC's Today on Friday (January 24) devoted the first half
hour to a glowing profile of Vice President Al Gore, concentrating
on his humor and dancing skills. In an interview segment, however,
Katie Couric got serious and recalled how Gore had cited his
sister's death from lung cancer as why he is so opposed to
smoking:
<br>
<dd>
Katie Couric: "You're aware that you were criticized for the
speech because your family was involved in the growing and selling
tobacco until the late '80s. Correct?"
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "That's true."
<br>
<dd>
Couric: "So wasn't it hypocritical in a way."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "No, I don't think that's a fair charge at all because
we, my family, quit growing tobacco."
<br>
<dd>
Couric: "I noticed that your mom seemed to be in visible pain
as you were talking about this, and, led me to wonder if you felt
you were exploiting your sister's death for political gain at all?"
<br>
<dd>Gore: "They and my brother in law encouraged this when the
time came."
<p>
<dd>
This is quite a U-turn for Today which repeatedly heaped
praise on Gore's speech last summer and fall. First, some
background. The New York Times reported July 3, 1996 that in 1988,
Al Gore told an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of
my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own
hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it."
<p>
<dd>
Now, fast forward to Chicago. The morning after Al Gore's
convention speech Bryant Gumbel opened the August 29 Today: 
<br>
<dd>
"The hall fell silent as the Vice President recalled his
sister's death from lung cancer after more than three decades of
smoking. It was an emotional attempt to build support for the
administration's anti-smoking efforts."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "And that is why, until I draw my last breath, I will
pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting our children
from the dangers of smoking."
<p>
<dd>
A few minutes later reporter Jim Miklaszewski asserted: "Gore
was most effective in his shot at Dole's record on tobacco.
Political but poignant, Gore invoked the memory of his sister, a
cigarette smoker who had died of lung cancer. With his parents
looking on, Gore recounted her agonizing death."
<br>
<dd>
Gore: "And in a very short time her breathing became labored,
and then she breathed her last breath. And that is why, until I
draw my last breath, I will pour my heart and soul into the cause
of protecting our children from the dangers of smoking."
<br>
<dd>
Miklaszewski: "It's a recurring theme, to put a human face on
Clinton administration politics and policy."
<p>
<dd>
Then, on October 9, Today featured an interview with Gore. But
interviewer Ed Gordon of MSNBC did not broach the tobacco
hypocrisy topic. Instead, he posed questions such as: "Many can
see that you have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in
our history. You satisfied with the role that you played for four
years?"
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) The January issue of Dateline, the newsletter published
by the Washington chapter of the Society of Professional
Journalists recounted the comments by Hal Bruno at the SPJ's
Christmas party. Bruno, political editor for ABC News, dismissed
concern that the lack of excitement in the election fueled talk
about liberal bias: 
<br>
<dd>
"What were we going to do differently? Pretend that it wasn't
static? Take up the slack for Dole? And we certainly can't do
anything about the perception that we're too liberal. I thought
David Brinkley [in his on air anti-Clinton diatribe] struck a
pretty good blow against the feeling that all reporters are
liberal Democrats, but it doesn't seem to have changed anything.
The truth is that I don't care anymore."  
<p>
<dd>
But Bruno is no fan of the Clinton Administration. Dateline
newsletter editor Willie Schatz quoted Bruno: "I've never seen
anything like the Clinton White House. It's got the arrogance of
JFK and the meanness of Nixon with none of the charm and
incompetence of Carter."
<p>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Item #4 today is the latest Notable Quotables, but here
are a couple of things that didn't make it but are worth noting.
<p>
<dd>
First, writing a point/counterpoint column (with Washington
Times Managing Editor Josette Shiner) Bonnie Erbe of NBC
Radio/Westwood One news and host of To the Contrary on PBS
declared:
<br>
<dd>
"My Walter Mitty fantasy for 1997 is the same as it was for
1996: an end to extremism in American politics. Perhaps the 1996
elections were an indication that we are getting there. The year
1995 was one of extremism at its worst from the slash-and-burn
attitude of the Republican congressional 'revolution' to the rise
in activity by militia groups, to that horrendous outburst of
terrorism in Oklahoma City. As bad as 1995 was, I take solace in
the fact that in 1996, Americans appeared to begin to disavow
extremists and extremism in all its forms." 
<p>
<dd>
Second, MRC news analyst Clay Waters noticed a bit of a
contradiction in two New York Times stories. In a January 7 story
headlined "Clinton Seeks Help for the Nation's Spirit," reporter
Alison Mitchell wrote: "Mr. Clinton noted that recent statistics
showed crime rates falling, pregnancy rates among teenagers
dropping and wage inequalities narrowing."
<br>
<dd>
Two days later the Times ran a piece on Labor Secretary Robert
Reich's departure, headlined "The Last Liberal (Almost) Leaves
Town." Reporter David Sanger began: "One of the lonely liberals of
the Clinton Administration, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich,
leaves Washington this week declaring that the government must
lead a campaign to narrow a growing gap between rich and poor..."
<p>
<dd>
But I thought Clinton already solved the income gap problem.

4) The latest edition of Notable Quotables, the MRC's bi-weekly 
compilation of the latest outrageous, sometimes humorous,
quotes in the liberal media. Many of these quotes have already
appeared in previous CyberAlerts, but I urge you to check out the
quotes beneath the "U.S. News Under Jim Fallows: More Liberal Bias
More Often" heading. It's a very illuminating contrast caught by
MRC news analyst Jim Forbes.
<p>
January 27, 1997 (Vol. Ten; No. 2)
<p>
Spoiled Spin on Tainted Meat 
<p>
"A federal jury in North Carolina ordered ABC television today to
pay the Food Lion supermarkets five and a half million dollars in
punitive damages. That's in connection with an undercover news
investigation that proved to be true...Important to note that the
truth of the report was never at issue in the lawsuit, not even
challenged, only the journalistic techniques." 
<br>-- Dan Rather on
the CBS Evening News, January 22.
<p>
Reality Check:
<br>
"Food Lion claimed 'the unedited footage provides an extraordinary
look at how a network news magazine can create false impressions,'
and that 'ABC producers and editors used a combination of staged
events and selective editing to fit a preconceived story line and
systematically fabricate a story to deceive the public.' In one
specific instance, Food Lion claims that when ABC used
hidden-camera footage of a Food Lion employee talking about how
she had cooked a batch of out-of-date chicken, it edited out the
part where she says she brought the matter up with her manager,
who directed her to throw the chicken away." 
<br>-- New Republic media
columnist William Powers, January 20.
<p>
U.S. News Under Jim Fallows: More Liberal Bias More Often 
<p>
"But there's another reason why all but nine of the 225 House
Republicans backed Gingrich: deep reservations about the man next
in line, the hard-right majority leader, Dick Armey. Just as Dan
Quayle's lack of gravitas led many Republicans to pray for the
health of George Bush, Armey's ideological stubbornness and
hot-headed rhetoric inspire in his colleagues protective optimism
about Gingrich....In a House brimming with mean-spirited rhetoric,
Armey stands out." 
<br>-- U.S. News & World Report Senior Writers Kent
Jenkins Jr. and Paul Glastris, January 20 issue.
<br>
<i>vs.</i> 
<br>
"Gore's commitment to the world of big ideas is no pose. Unlike
John F. Kennedy and Adlai Stevenson, who became darlings of the
highbrow set without fully earning the honor, Gore is truly
engaged in the life of the mind...Had the younger Gore not become
a Congressman at 28, a Senator at 36, and Vice President at 44, he
might have become the sort of essayist who aspires to membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Letters." 
<br>-- U.S. News Senior Writer Timothy Noah, January 27 issue.
<p>
Absolving Clinton
<p>
"There's been a lot of talk lately, as you know, printed and so
forth, about the Lincoln Bedroom and the people who stay here. And
obviously a lot of them are your friends. And I don't think
anybody would begrudge somebody having guests in their own house.
Some of them, though, it seems apparently you didn't know quite as
well. And we're wondering if you might feel let down a little bit
by your staff or by the DNC in their zeal to raise funds?" 
<br>--Question from Washington Post reporters in interview published
Jan. 19.
<p>
Hillary's White House Hell
<p>
CBS reporter Martha Teichner: "Health care was just the beginning.
She has been the subject of a non-stop, ceaseless litany of
investigations. Three at the moment being conducted by Whitewater
special counsel Kenneth Starr. Speculation she may be indicted
continues."
<br>
Hillary Clinton: "I expect this matter to drag out as long as it
is to anyone else's advantage to drag it out and then it will end.
I mean no one likes to be accused of having done anything improper
or wrong. It becomes frustrating when you know that people are
saying things that aren't true, but you just learn to live with it
and you just go on day after day and..."
<br>
Teichner: "But how do you do that though in the climate of a
non-stop four- or even eight-year bashing?" -- January 19 CBS
Sunday Morning. Teichner and Hillary were classmates at Wellesley
College.)
<p>
Illegal Taping? Don't Let It Distract from Nailing Newt 
<p>
"I'm not trying to minimize the offense here, though I would have
to suggest that the ones of Speaker Gingrich look considerably
more severe than Mr. McDermott's." 
<br>-- Chicago Tribune reporter
Ellen Warren on CNN & Company, January 16.
<p>
"As a political matter, the Republicans managed brilliantly on the
last two weekends of television talk shows to keep the focus where
they wanted....Of course, they could not have done it without the
Democrats' giving them a clear field. The first weekend the
Democrats had available a Time magazine article suggesting that
the leadership, possibly waving campaign money, put pressure on
two ethics committee members to write an extraordinary letter
telling colleagues to vote for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. The
Democrats hardly brought it up. Then last weekend the Democrats
effectively failed to make their case that the taped conversation,
whatever its ancestry, showed that Mr. Gingrich had broken his
promises to the ethics committee." 
<br>-- New York Times reporter Adam
Clymer, who first reported the contents of the GOP cellular phone
conversation, in a January 16 "news analysis."
<p>
"The New Republic points out this week that the book [To Renew
America] leans heavily on copyrighted materials developed for
Newt's college course by the tax-exempt group that is at the
center of his current problems. That could well be a violation of
IRS rules that prohibit tax-exempt organizations from transferring
assets to private individuals. It also calls into question
Gingrich's claim that he's no Jim Wright -- the Democratic Speaker
whose ouster he spearheaded -- because he never sought to line his
own pockets. After taxes, his royalties would have stuffed his
pockets with something like $300,000 -- the amount of his fine.
Maybe he should hand it over. If nothing else, it would prove that
even when you can't count on the rule of law in Washington,
there's always poetic justice." 
<br>-- Conclusion to Time Senior
Editor Richard Lacayo's story, January 27 issue.
<p>
Shaw Fawns
<p>
"A very, very special day for this President when you recall that
four years ago he came to this city, he was expecting so much. His
mother was at his side there at the Inaugural. She passed away a
year later. And when you look at what was besetting the United
States, a four trillion dollar deficit, budget problems, foreign
policy problems. The budget deficit now has decreased. There seems
to be relative peace in Bosnia. The Middle East, the breakthrough
of the Hebron agreement, a lot has gone on in four short years."
<br>
-- Bernard Shaw during CNN Inauguration coverage, January 20.
<p>
God, I Admire You 
<p>
"Tribe's detractors think his arrogance is finally catching up
with him. 'He was his usual glib self,' one veteran practitioner
sniffed after the argument. But Tribe has a lot to be arrogant and
glib about. There is still no one better on his feet, no one
better able to respond to questions from the justices with a fully
developed and usually persuasive response. But sometimes he seems
too nimble, too cerebral, too able to see contradiction and
ironies and nuances light-years before the justices and other mere
mortals are able to. Especially coming in the last quarter of a
two-hour argument, he seemed to make the justices' heads hurt.
Baryshnikov probably has had the same effect on dance aficionados
-- too much dazzle to take all at once. Maybe Tribe needs to slow
down and simplify his routine the next time out -- and dance the
macarena instead of Swan Lake." 
<br>-- USA Today reporter Tony Mauro
in the January 13 Legal Times.
<p>
CBS: Clueless Broadcasting System
<p>
Larry King: "I'm told by our producers, that a lot of calls, so
rather than make it microscopic here, are complaining about
advocates being hired by television stations. [Robert] Shapiro was
on one side in the Simpson trial, he's hired. [George]
Stephanopoulos is now at ABC -- that we're not getting balance."
<br>
Dan Rather: "I think that's a valid criticism. I'm concerned about
it. Look, a Bill Moyers came out of the Lyndon Johnson White House
and became one of the great journalists of all time."
<br>
King: "But a major liberal, self-confessed."
<br>
Rather: "Ah, is he? I don't want to get into that, but he was
terrific. I do think, personal opinion, it's gone too far." 
<br>--Exchange on Larry King Live, January 13.

<dd> 
1) A week and a half ago VP Gore's office conceded that the
Buddhist Temple event was indeed a fundraiser. CNN did a story,
but not ABC, CBS or NBC. That same week, on January 16, some major
newspapers carried stories contending Clinton changed policy to
match donor's desires and that John Huang influenced Commerce
Dept. policy. Nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. 
<BR>
<DD>    
The Washington Times on January 23 and the Washington Post on
January 24 reported that Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry
admitted, contrary to earlier White House assurances, that senior
adviser Bruce Lindsey knew in 1994 that the Lippo Group had paid
$250,000 to Webster Hubbell. Lippo retained Hubbell after the
former Associate Attorney General resigned. The suggestion has
been raised that Lippo paid Hubbell in order to keep him from
talking to the independent counsel. Network coverage: Zilch.
<p>
<DD>    
But on Friday, January 24, the White released documents
detailing how over 100 "coffees" were held at the White House with
various ethnic and business groups to raise money for the
Democratic National Committee, all attended by Bill Clinton,
Hillary Clinton, Al Gore or Tipper Gore.
<BR>
<DD>    
All the networks aired stories Friday night. Here's how Tom
Brokaw opened NBC Nightly News:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Good evening. Everyone in Washington agrees that the money
game in that town is simply out of control for Republican and
Democrat alike. And the more we learn, the greater the outrage.
There's enough blame to go all the way around the country tonight.
But the latest money trail, it turns out, is a four lane highway
leading from the White House to almost every group in America. As
NBC's Andrea Mitchell tells us now, the White House released the
documentation, the Republicans are thrilled."
<p>
<DD>    
One of the meetings involved bank executives and the chief
bank regulator. Appearing on Sunday's CNN Late Edition (January
26) Associate White House counsel Lanny Davis denied the bankers
swayed administration policy. That prompted CNN reporter Brooks
Jackson to ask Davis this very interesting question not posed by
others in the media:
<BR>
<DD>    
"One thing puzzles me. Now if the President invited these
bankers to listen to them, with the implication that if they said
something that got to him he might change policy and then he
didn't change policy, was he wasting their time. Was this all a
sham?"
<p>
<a name="2">
<dd> 
2) On Sunday's (January 26) Face the Nation CBS host Bob
Schieffer noted how Newt Gingrich complained about a harsher
ethics standard held against conservatives. Schieffer then asked
Senator John McCain: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"He apparently made an agreement, or did make with the ethics
committee, that he would accept the punishment that they meted out
and in exchange for that he would not contest it nor would he
criticize it. He has now received his punishment. This morning we
learn that he went before his hometown folks yesterday and
basically said none of this was my fault. It was either the fault
of my lawyers or there's a double standard for conservatives in
Washington, no matter what they do they're going to be blamed for
it. Is that good for the Republican cause?"
<p>
<DD>    
First, a minor memo to Bob: Watch TV. Gingrich's comments
happened Saturday morning and were reported that night.
<p>
<DD>    
Second, as Bob Novak reported in his column last week,
Gingrich "was the victim of a classic bait and switch scheme" by
ethics committee members. Gingrich and the committee agreed that
he would admit to two charges, "but the report of James Cole,
House ethics committee special counsel, made public Jan. 17 was
concluded by a much harsher bill of particulars against the
Speaker. In floor speeches Tuesday, veteran partisan Democratic
politicians Ben Cardin and Nancy Pelosi echoed Cole's report
rather than what Gingrich had admitted. This is near total victory
for foes who have plotted the Speaker's fall for two years."
<p>
<DD>    
On CNN's Late Edition Steve Roberts of the New York Daily News
(and formerly with U.S. News) offered little sympathy for
Gingrich. CNN showed a clip of Gingrich: "You can on the left do
anything you want and nobody seems to notice. But if you are a
conservative and you follow the law and you hire lawyers and you
do what you can, if you make a single mistake you better plan to
be pilloried because you're politically incorrect."
<BR>
<DD>    
Roberts shot back: "Oh, please. That is my reaction. I mean
he's the guy who drove Jim Wright out of office. Jim Wright was
hounded out of office by Newt Gingrich. The press covered that.
The press is covering all of Bill Clinton's problems....C'mon,
that's silly."
<p>
<DD>    
The "press covered" Jim Wright? Eventually, at best. As the
MRC's Tim Graham determined in providing research for a recent
column by MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell, the media were less than
excited about Gingrich's concerns about Wright. Bozell explained:
"On September 24, 1987, Washington Post reporter Charles Babcock
broke the story of Speaker Jim Wright's book deal. Absolute
television silence followed. On February 19, 1988 Newt Gingrich
asked for an ethics investigation of Wright. He gained two
paragraphs in the Los Angeles Times and a mention in the
Washington Post. Network coverage: zero."
<p>
<DD>    
On CNN Reader's Digest's Michael Barone did note that Dick
Gephardt's false statements about a real estate deal failed to
generate much coverage. But on Fox News Sunday Brit Hume, newly
installed as the network's Washington Managing Editor, took on his
brethren. After the Washington Post's Juan Williams insisted
Gingrich's violations would have put a regular person in jail,
Hume countered:  
<BR>
<DD>    
"Speaking of double standards, there is an interesting
question here. About this time last week we were all still
interested in the case of Mr. McDermott, and the leaked tape, the
illegally recorded and apparently illegally released tape. Even
the media for a time were interested in that. What happened to
that story? We never found out, we never got to the bottom of it.
It just fell off the side of the table. Now does anyone seriously
imagine here that if it were Newt Gingrich on that side, or some
other prominent conservative Republican, that the Hounds of Hell
in the Washington media would have dropped it because the case it
came up in the context of was concluded? I doubt it very
seriously."
<BR>
<DD>    
Williams responded: "Certainly we're all aware and talking
about it. I think you're being harsh."
<p>
<DD>    
Harsh. The ultimate media insult normally reserved for
conservatives on the House.
<p>
<DD>    
And before it's totally out of date, I should mention the
debate over the newsworthiness of what Gingrich said in the taped
cellular call. In the January 20 Washington Post media reporter
Howard Kurtz noted that the tape was given not only to the New
York Times which ran with it, but also the Atlanta Journal
Constitution. The Atlanta paper ran a short New York Times News
Service item, but Kurtz relayed that Washington correspondent
Jeanne Cummings "references to the tape were deleted from a
separate story she wrote on Gingrich and the ethics
committee...While Cummings was reported to be furious, the Atlanta
editors defend their news judgment. 'Quite frankly, we didn't see
it as being any kind of smoking gun,' said Carl Rauscher, the
paper's national editor."
<BR>
<DD>    
Not quite the impression given by the networks or other
papers. 
<p>

<dd> 
3) ABC's Prime Time Live is not conceding that they made any
errors or exaggerations in their Food Lion story. As transcribed
by MRC News analyst Eugene Eliasen, here's what Diane Sawyer told
viewers January 22:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Now to bring you up to date on a story you've heard 
about. In November of 1992, we broadcast a story on the Food Lion
supermarket chain, in which we raised a number of serious
questions about the way they handled and repackaged food. After
that story aired, Food Lion sued us. Not over the accuracy of the
report, but over the way we gathered some of the information, by
working in their supermarkets undercover. Today a jury in 
North Carolina awarded punitive damages to Food Lion because of
the techniques we used to bring those facts to light. Roone
Arledge, President of ABC News, called the award unconscionable
and said, quote, 'if large corporations were allowed to stop hard
hitting investigative journalism, the American people would be the
losers,' unquote. ABC will appeal the decision, and again, the
truth of the broadcast was not at issue in this decision and ABC 
News stands behind the talented journalists who brought this
important story to your attention."
<p>
<DD>    
A few hours later on Good Morning America on Thursday analyst
Eliasen caught this re-assertion from co-host Charles Gibson: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Right now, we're going to talk about ourselves. Yesterday, a
jury ordered ABC News to pay five-and-a-half million dollars in
damages to the Food Lion Supermarket chain. It came about because
of a 1992 report on Prime Time Live. The show said that the food
chain knowingly sold spoiled or contaminated food to their
customers. The food chain didn't contest the report itself but
argued that ABC had used improper methods, that producers had 
disguised themselves in order to get a story."
<p>
<DD>    
Time magazine Managing Editor Walter Isaacson asserted: "It
has a chilling effect for a couple reasons. First of all, it
reminds us that people are pretty fed up with the press in this
country and the media and some of the tactics. I don't think this 
was just about ABC or this case, I think people have sensed that
the press has gone a bit too far, become like jackals in pursuing
some of the tabloid stories. It's a shame it happened in this case
cause this was a very valuable, important story that ABC did and
the truth of the story was not contended in court."
<p>
<DD>    
The assertion that the accuracy of ABC's Food Lion story is
beyond dispute continued on the weekend talk shows where
commentators almost universally failed to tell viewers that Food
Lion does contest the charges, or that a union suggested the story
to ABC (Food Lion is non-union). For all we know, Food Lion may
have been guilty of some bad food practices, but the media have
refused to concede that maybe ABC tried to stage events for tape
or explain that just because a company does not file a libel suit
does not mean they find a story true. It is virtually impossible
to win a libel suit even for a false story because of the requirement
to prove malice/"a reckless disregard for the truth."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On the January 24 Washington Week in Review on PBS Alan
Murray, Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal,
explained:
<BR>
<DD>    
"I have problems with journalists lying about who they are in
order to get stories. But if Food Lion was bleaching meat and
selling it to people, people want to know that. People watch these
shows for a reason. Isn't that exactly what journalism is supposed
to do for the public?"
<BR>
<DD>    
Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post did note: "Well, I should
say that Food Lion disputes that, although that was not at issue
in the courtroom..."
<BR>
<DD>    
Host Ken Bode then showed a clip of Food Lion's compilation of
outtakes tape in which a Food Lion narrator charged ABC with
creating false resumes. Bode then insisted that ABC followed a
great tradition:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Let me remind folks that Nellie Bligh (sp?) in the 19th
Century went into, feigned madness and went into a New York insane
asylum to demonstrate the brutal conditions of the madhouses of
New York. And Upton Sinclair did a similar kind of thing in the
slaughter houses of Chicago. This is not something that's very
new..."
<BR>
<DD>    
Kurtz responded with a rare mention of Food Lion's argument:    
"...And one thing that hasn't happened in the days of Nellie Bligh
was that there were arguments made by Food Lion, they showed the
jury outtakes, 45 hours of videotape that wasn't on the air. And
they argue, ABC denies, that some of this was sort of staged, that
the ABC producers tried to get permission to sell dated food and
in one case when a colleague said 'no, no don't sell that chicken
it's too old,' you could hear the ABC producer saying 'damn.' Now
that's the kind of thing that has a powerful effect on a jury."
<BR>
<DD>    
Bode replied: "That's true. I did see that in the tape, that is
true."
<BR>
<DD>    
But Bode failed to let viewers see that incriminating portion
of the outtake tape.
<p>
<DD>    
-- On this past weekend's Inside Washington Evan Thomas of
Newsweek asserted:
<BR>
<DD>    
"It was pretty scary for the press because the story was
basically right, it looked like Food Lion really did have some
problems and ABC got in there and exposed them. Yes, they did some
illegal stuff to get there and we can have a debate as we will
about whether reporters are supposed to do that, but for the press
it was a very scary verdict."
<BR>
<DD>    
"Basically right" but no exploration of what was untrue.
<p>
<DD>    
NPR's Nina Totenberg defended ABC's methods: "I must say this
is a time-honored way of getting at a story you can't get
otherwise. It goes back to Nellie Bligh who pretended to be a
crazy person in order to get into mental institutions and find out
what was going on there, you know a hundred years ago. Muckraking
journalism couldn't exist without this technique."
<p>
<DD>    
At the very end of the segment host Gordon Peterson noted that
Food Lion says ABC left out footage which included an ABC staffer
stating "we're going to get these guys." Deborah Mathis of the
Gannett News Service found that troubling: "That is the part that
bothers me most. When I hear about some things that actually sound
like entrapment, not just being there and covering but actual
entrapment by reporters, now that is flatly wrong. There can be no
defense, in view, of that."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On the McLaughlin Group Newsweek's Eleanor Clift charged:   
<BR>
<DD>    
"The story was accurate and we shouldn't forget our tradition of
muckraking in this country."
<p>
<DD>    
-- On Fox News Sunday Brit Hume stood up for Food Lion over
ABC, his former employer. Noting the outtakes, Hume explained:
<BR>
<DD>    
"Food Lion turns around and takes from that 45 hours a tape
that was produced for the trial -- about 20 minutes or so worth --
and produces a video that makes ABC look every bit as bad in the
news business as Food Lion looked in the food business. It's the
first I can remember an organization under assault from the news
media doing to the news media what it claimed the news media had
done to it."
<BR>
<DD>    
Washington Times Managing Editor Josette Shiner said the media
should admit mistakes and Hume suggested ABC went beyond the
evidence, but The Washington Post's Juan Williams retorted: "I think
you guys are crazy," saying of ABC's piece: "That's good journalism."
<BR>
<DD>    
Hume then told viewers: "They worked very closely with a labor
union that is shut out of that food chain which obviously is an
interested party."
<p>
<DD>    
So a mention on the talk shows of labor unions and of staged
events, but what did they and the network news stories leave out?
"ABC's Food Lyin'" is the headline over a fascinating February 10
National Review article by Thomas McArdle of Investor's Business
Daily. Reviewing the outtakes and the case overall McArdle
revealed:
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "One of the producers, Susan Barnett, after several days of
work as a deli clerk at a Myrtle Beach Food Lion, is obviously
very frustrated at not being able to get a story. As she sees a
Food Lion employee start to clean a meat slicer, she can't conceal
her disappointment.  Oh damn,' she says. Then as it sinks in, she
says a long, drawn out  Sh--.'"  
<BR>
<DD>    
-- Referring to producer Lynne Dale, McArdle wrote: "For some
reason Mrs. Dale has left the store at 9:30am. The videotape is
blacked out, but the audio can be heard clearly. 'I'm gonna lose
my job,' she nervously tells one of the technicians. Right before
the tape cuts off, the technician is heard telling her, 'Throw
that tape away.' Food Lion is convinced that what Mrs. Dale had
just been doing was removing a 10-inch wire from the water heater
to make it impossible to clean the store's meat department that
day." The plumber testified at the trial that the heater had been
vandalized. Dale denied the charge.
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "But if ABC had nothing to hide, why did it originally
leave out key segments of the tapes when ordered to provide Food
Lion with copies? Why did the copies provided by ABC, which owns
the best in high-tech video equipment, seem to be copies of copies
of copies, at least one segment re-recorded on used tape? Why were
multiple 'cutting signatures' found on the tapes? 
<BR>
<DD>    
-- "The chain became a huge threat to the United Food and
Commercial Workers union (UFCW) which targeted it for punitive
action as far back as the early 1980s. Douglas Dority, the UFCW's
international President, said of 'the non-union chains -- the Food
Lions' during a 1990 conference, 'We must either reduce these
chains' market share...or we must put them out of business. There
is no other option.'" UFCW pushed the story on ABC.
<p>
<DD>    
Still, the January 23 USA Today quoted ABC producer Lynne
Dale: "What frightens me most about all this is that Food Lion
tried to punish us as journalists without ever challenging the
truth of the broadcast."
<p>
<a name="4">
<dd> 
4) Headline from the front page of the January 25 New York
Times: "Deaths From AIDS Decline Sharply in New York City/ Access
to Care is Cited/ 30% Drop in All Ethnic Groups and Both Sexes in
1996 -- New-Case Rate Is Same."
<BR>
<DD>    
But the same day's Washington Post has even better news: "AIDS
Toll Falls by Half in New York."
<p>
<a name="5">
<dd> 
5) Finally, last Wednesday morning the local Washington, DC
media as well as CNN and the other networks later in the day, were
full of stories on an explosion near Planned Parenthood's DC
office. MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham alerted me to a
humorous take on the coverage from Washington Post "Metro"
columnist Steve Twomey: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"All morning, the radio had been pumping out breathless
reports of an explosion near the clinic...My first conclusion upon
arrival: People have a funny definition of 'near.' If you think
'near' includes a spot at the opposite end of the block, and on
the other side of the street, then I suppose an explosive device
went off 'near' Planned Parenthood. The site was much nearer to
National Geographic, which suggests at least the possibility that
somebody was objecting to photos of bare-breasted Polynesian
women."

<dd>
1) Some notes from Inauguration Day coverage:<p>

-- MRC analyst Clay Waters caught this bit of generosity by
CNN's Bernard Shaw at about 11am ET:
<p>
<dd>
"A very, very special day for this President when you recall
that our years ago he came to this city he was expecting so much.
His mother was at his side there at the Inaugural. She passed away
a year later. And when you look at what was besetting the United
States, a four trillion dollar deficit, budget problems, foreign
policy problems. The budget deficit now has decreased. There seems
to be relative peace in Bosnia. The Middle East, the breakthrough
of the Hebron agreement, a lot has gone on in four short years."
<p>
<dd>
A while after Clinton's address, in an exchange with guest
commentator Peggy Noonan (a former Reagan and Bush speechwriter),
Shaw defended the President's anti-conservative comments:
<br>
<dd>
Noonan: "Some of the language seemed almost radical. He had a
sentence in there that said as each new wave of immigrants come
into the United States they become targets for hatred and
persecution or something to that extent and I thought 
Yowsa! That's a little bit hot."
<br>
<dd>
Shaw: "Well some people would argue that those immigrants with
dark skins have been the object of discrimination rather than
those immigrants from Eastern European nations."
<br>
<dd>
Noonan: "But targets! Read it to me, 'Wave after wave of
immigrants come and become targets of hatred.' That's just a
little bit hot. I have a feeling he went a little over 
the line in that section, in that part."
<br>
<dd>
Shaw: "Well do you think he went over the line in view of the
campaign, the fire-hot, white-heat hot, if you will, rhetoric and
debate in the just-concluded presidential campaign. Immigration, a
very visceral issue in California and elsewhere?"
<p>
-- Over on NBC before Clinton spoke, MRC analyst Geoffrey
Dickens noticed NBC News VP Tim Russert relaying as fact the
rhetoric of liberals opposed to welfare reform:
<p>
<dd>
"Many children in this country, it is estimated, will fall
below the poverty line with the changes in the welfare reform
bill. And Hillary Clinton is going to take initiatives to try to
bring some of those children into programs which will help educate
and feed and clothe them." 
<p>
-- Monday night Tom Brokaw announced on the January 20 NBC
Nightly News: "The President, it turns out, worked on his speech
right up to the moment that he delivered it and while it lacked
great passion or memorable phrases, it was filled with noble
intentions."
<p>
<dd>
In Tuesday's USA Today (January 21) former Carter
Administration official turned Time magazine reporter turned USA
Today news columnist Walter Shapiro also found comfort in
Clinton's attack on conservatives. Citing the same passage that so
upset Noonan ("Each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to
old prejudices. Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of
religious or political conviction are no different") Shapiro
endorsed Clinton's take: "That last sentence was a fusillade
against aimed at California Gov. Pete Wilson and the Republicans
like him who dangerously fan the flames of discord with nostrums
like Proposition 209, which rolled back affirmative action."
<br>
<dd>
Shapiro continued: "I doubt that Ralph Reed and the Christian
Coalition were cheering wildly as the President attacked
'prejudice and contempt' masquerading as 'religious conviction.'
But one stirring passage does not a reborn President make."
<p>
<dd>
Ignoring the jabs at conservatives and emphasizing Clinton's
call to end partisan bickering, ABC's new White House reporter,
John Donvan, concluded his World News Tonight story: 
<br>
<dd>
"...Tomorrow, of course, it is back to business.
Another question, however, is whether it will also be back to
politics. If it is not, and if the President's address today had
anything to do with it, then that speech, Peter, certainly
deserves to go down in history."<br>

<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) Reporters continue to assume that President Clinton was
some kind of innocent bystander to Democratic fundraising tactics.
<p>
<dd>
The January 19 Washington Post ran the transcript of its
interview with Clinton. Here's the campaign finance questions: 
<br>
<dd>
"There's been a lot of talk lately, as you know, printed and
so forth, about the Lincoln Bedroom and the people who stay here.
And obviously a lot of them are your friends. And I don't think
anybody would begrudge somebody having guests in their own house.
Some of them, though, it seems apparently you didn't know quite as
well. And we're wondering if you might feel let down a little bit
by your staff or by the DNC in their zeal to raise funds?"
<p>
<dd>
On Monday's CBS Evening News reporter Rita Braver noted that
while the President was being sworn in, "White House aides were
putting the finishing touches on the plan he'll propose tomorrow
in the wake of he controversy over Democratic fundraising. The
President will also announce new rules tightening up contributor's
access to the White House."
<p>
<dd>
It's as if these guests showed up unannounced and Clinton was
forced to accommodate them.

<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Tuesday night the broadcast networks highlighted the
ethical breaches of Newt Gingrich, but the word "ethics" didn't
pass their lips in stories on Clinton's proposed campaign finance
rules. 
<p>
Dan Rather opened the January 21 CBS Evening News:
<br>
<dd>
"Good evening. The mood in Washington changed dramatically
overnight, from celebration to castigation. The House of
Representatives voted today to reprimand and fine Speaker Newt
Gingrich for low ethics. Specifically, using money from tax-exempt
foundations to fund his partisan college course. And, a pattern of
giving investigators inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable
information."
<br>
<dd>
CBS didn't mention a word about Clinton's campaign finance
proposal.
<p>
As a "Day of Dishonor" chyron was displayed, Tom Brokaw opened 
NBC Nightly News: 
<br>
<dd>
"Newt Gingrich, who came to power after all preaching a higher
standard in American politics, a man who brought down another
Speaker on ethics accusations, tonight he has on his own record
the judgment of his peers, Democrat and Republican alike. By an
overwhelming vote they found him guilty of ethics violations."
<br>
<dd>
Introducing the second story of the night Brokaw emphasized
how Clinton was solving a problem: 
<br>
<dd>    
"For his part, President Clinton tried to take the high road
today on political money, just when Gingrich was caught in the
headlights. But, of course, Clinton has his own troubling record
on campaign contributions. We have more tonight on how he's trying
to get beyond that now from NBC's Jim Miklaszewski."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski noted that "in the last campaign it was the
Democrats who took questionable foreign contributions. As of
today, no more. The Democratic Party will no longer take political
money from foreign firms or individuals, no longer accept more tan
$100,000 from any single donor per year. And White House access
for campaign contributors will be tightened. But the new rules do
not apply to individual Democratic candidates and President
Clinton will still invite big contributors to sleep in the Lincoln
Bedroom."
<br>
<dd>
After a clip of Common Cause's Ann McBride saying voluntary
rules aren't enough, Miklaszeski announced:
<br>
<dd>
"But the President claims no matter what mistakes Democrats
have made, Republicans are worse."
<br>
<dd>
Clinton: "They raise more money, they raise more foreign
money, they raise more money in gig contributions and we take all
the heat. It's a free ride."
<br>
<dd>
Stop the tape. "...and President Clinton will still invite big
contributors to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom." Huh? NBC viewers
must have asked. That story broke December 15, but that was its
first mention on NBC Nightly News.
<p>
On ABC's World News Tonight Peter Jennings told viewers: 
<br>
<dd>
"The Democrats have had their own highly embarrassing
problems, as you know, with campaign contributions during the
presidential race, have tried today, to get some of the problems
behind them. New rules for who may give and under what circumstances."
<p>
<dd>
Stop the tape. "As you know..." How would World News Tonight
viewers know about major developments in the Democratic
fundraising scandal. They have yet to mention the Lincoln Bedroom
as Motel 6 news. As noted in the January 16 and 17 CyberAlerts,
NBC Nightly News and ABC World News Tonight have failed to report
several recent revelations, including:
<p>
-- Last week Vice President Al Gore admitted to the AP that he 
used "a poor choice of words" when he insisted an April 1996 
fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple was nothing more than a 
"community outreach" event. The AP noted that three days before 
the event the DNC sent Gore a memo explaining how he should 
"extend appreciation for participant support and inspire 
political and fundraising efforts." 
<br>
-- The day after Christmas the Democratic National Committee
released a huge pile of documents on their fundraising activities.
The papers showed how foreign donors to the DNC got special access
to the White House and Clinton. The New York Times ran a big piece
on the December 27 front page.
<br>
-- Last Thursday three newspapers uncovered new aspects in the
John Huang/Democratic fundraising saga: Thursday's Washington Post
front page headline: "Guest Lists at White House Didn't Include
Rap Sheets: Some at DNC Fund-Raising Coffees Ran Afoul of Law."    
The Los Angeles Times front page: "Papers Show Huang's Policy Role
at Commerce: Documents Contrast with Assertions that Figure in
Democratic Fundraising Scandal Had Minimal Duties." The 
Boston Globe's page one headline declared: "Clinton Policy Shift
Followed Asian-American Fundraiser."
<p>
<dd>
ABC's John Donvan did conclude his piece by noting: "...The
new rules look like serious reform. The only question is how good
the Democratic Party will be at enforcing them after a 1996
campaign when millions in illegal and improper contributions
reached the party coffers and had to be sent back."
<p>
<dd>
And NBC's Miklaszewski was the only one to report that "The
Democrats problems are far from over. The Republican Chairman of
the House Rules Committee sent a letter to the FBI today asking it
to investigate whether some of those foreign contributions may
have been a part of espionage against the U.S."
<p>
<dd>
Sounds like a good subject for an investigation by NBC News,
or at least an explanatory story. But don't count on it. In a
January 17 USA Today story reporter Martha Moore relayed the
perspective of NBC's Russert: 
<dd>    
"The test facing the media may be to not spend all its time
covering scandals. 'Do we just become totally overwhelmed with the
news of scandal, and forget that all the things we talked about
during the campaign -- Medicare, balanced budget and Social
Security -- are still going on?' asks NBC's Tim Russert. 'The
scandals will eventually be resolved,' but the issues 'will have a
lot more impact and consequence.'"

<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Time magazine decided to equate Newt Gingrich with former
House Speaker Jim Wright who used royalties from bulk book sales
to pocket money and circumvent honoraria limits. Richard Lacayo
concluded his piece in the current (January 27) issue:
<br>
<dd>
"The New Republic points out this week that the book [To Renew
America] leans heavily on copyrighted materials developed for
Newt's college course by the tax-exempt group that is at the
center of his current problems.
<br>
<dd>
"That could well be a violation of IRS rules that prohibit
tax-exempt organizations from transferring assets to private
individuals. It also calls into question Gingrich's claim that
he's no Jim wright -- the Democratic Speaker whose ouster he
spearheaded -- because he never sought to line his own pockets.
After taxes, his royalties would have stuffed his pockets with
something like $300,000 -- the amount of his fine. Maybe he should
hand it over. If nothing else, it would prove that even when you
can't count on the rule of law in Washington, there's always
poetic justice." 

<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Back on January 3 MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
debated Eleanor Clift on MSNBC about coverage of scandals. Here's
one exchange in which Clift was not fully forthcoming:
<br>
<dd>
Tim Graham: "What's worse, Eleanor, is you coming on this
program and pretending you're not a partisan, that you can go out
on the weekends on the press and compare Newt Gingrich to Charles
Manson and than say you can be an observer--"
<br>
<dd>    
Eleanor Clift, Newsweek: "I have never compared Newt Gingrich
to Charles Manson."
<br>
<dd>
Graham: "McLaughlin Group."
<br>
<dd>
Clift: "In fact, I wrote a book called War Without Bloodshed
published earlier this year in which Newt Gingrich is one of the
characters. He provided the title for the book. I believe I have
fairly covered Newt Gingrich, and I think he would answer that
well."
<p>
<dd>
Let's go to the videotape. On the November 18, 1995 McLaughlin
Group Clift declared: "Newt Gingrich teaching manners is like
Charles Manson teaching nonviolence."

<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) Speaking of bizarre analogies, we normally don't follow
Morton Kondracke of Roll Call since he's not with a major news
outlet, but here's his argument on how Gingrich's punishment was
too soft, as expressed on the McLaughlin Group this past weekend:  
<br>
<dd>
"Now, as to Newt Gingrich, this is thoroughly in keeping with 
the OJ Simpson case, for example. OJ Simpson may have committed 
murder, but he gets fined as a result, he has to pay money. By this 
theory you get $300,000 for this offense, whatever it is, big fine, 
Richard Nixon instead of being impeached should have gotten a $5 
million dollar fine, maybe. And Jim Wright should have paid $50,000 
bucks?"
<p>
<dd>
Well, at least it's not as bad as Sam Donaldson comparing Mr. Newt
to Lenin.

<dd>
1) Sunday night CBS broadcast an Inaugural Gala show from
the USAir Arena in Largo, Maryland co-hosted by Whoopi Goldberg,
Michael Douglas and Candice Bergen. On Saturday they held a
rehearsal show and a local TV reporter talked to some of the
participants.    
<p>
<dd>
WUSA-TV's Eyewitness News at 11 on Saturday night included a
couple of interesting soundbites. NYPD Blue star Jimmy Smits
explained why he flew in from California: "I believe he's a
wonderful President, has been and will continue to be. So I'm
honored that they would think to ask -- hey, come on down and hang
with me."
<p>
<dd>
Singer Stevie Wonder tied his vote for Clinton with the murder
of Bill Cosby's son: "We hope that because of us voting for this
man and voting for change for tomorrow, that will help these kinds
of things to not happen."
<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) The CBS News show Sunday Morning on January 19 featured
one of First Lady Hillary Clinton's two television interviews for
the Inauguration. Reporter Martha Teichner portrayed an oppressed
and misunderstood First Lady.
<p>
<dd>
On her role in health care reform, Teichner asked: "Were you
startled at the fact that is was as controversial an issue as it
was and that you became controversial?"
<br>
<dd>
Following Hillary Clinton's response, Teichner continued:
"Health care was just the beginning. She has been the subject of a
non-stop, ceaseless litany of investigations. Three at the moment
being conducted by Whitewater special counsel Kenneth Starr.
Speculation she may be indicted continues."
<br>
<dd>
Hillary Clinton responded: "I expect this matter to drag out
as long as it is to anyone else's advantage to drag it out and
then it will end. I mean no one likes to be accused of having done
anything improper or wrong. It becomes frustrating when you know
that people are saying things that aren't true, but you just learn
to live with it and you just go on day after day and..."
<br>
<dd>
Teichner jumped in: "But how do you do that though in the
climate of a non-stop four or even eight year bashing?"
<p>
<dd>
A bit later Teichner continued her sympathetic report: "Her
biggest gripe is that the positive is never what the public sees.
That her media image as a First Lady under fire, edgy and
defensive, belies the real Hillary Clinton who has even been known
to laugh." 
<p>
<dd>
After a bit of video, Teichner went on: "One gauge of a First
Lady's stamp on the White House is the art she chooses to display
there. 'Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City' by Henry Tanner is
the first work acquired for the permanent collection by an African
American artist. It now hangs in the Green Room."
<p>
<dd>
Finally, Teichner ended by showing the White House sculpture
garden, inquiring of Mrs. Clinton: "Do you ever just go there and
sit?"
<p>
<dd>
Not once did Teichner ask a tough question or even suggest
that Hillary Clinton's actions may have contributed to her
problems. 
<p>
<dd>
The CBS interview aired at about 9:30am ET. Less than ten
hours later, at 7pm ET C-SPAN aired its interview with Hillary
Clinton. In it she complained about a "very effective, well
organized advocacy press that is, I think, very up-front in its
right wing, conservative inclinations and makes no apologies."
According to a story in Saturday's Washington Times, she
elaborated on how "there's not something comparable to that" on the
liberal side: "You've got a conservative press and/or right wing
press presence with really nothing on the other end of the
political spectrum, so that most of what is left in what you might
call the middle or the establishment or the mainstream tries to be
objective and tries to be thoughtful."
<p>
<dd>
I guess she'd put CBS in the "thoughtful" category.
<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) If you want to avoid George Stephanopoulos, or Bill
Kristol for that matter, don't watch ABC News. Former Clinton aide
Stephanopoulos made his premiere as an ABC News analyst on
Friday's Good Morning America paired with Bill Kristol. He Kristol
also appeared together on ABC's World News Saturday, plus Sunday's
GMA and This Week as part of the show's roundtable.
<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Al Hunt, the Wall Street Journal's Executive Washington
Editor, can't admit when he's wrong. As pointed out in a past
CyberAlert, some in the media have blamed Newt Gingrich for taking
money from children because he took over the Abraham Lincoln
Foundation and used it to fund his college course. But as Bob
Novak pointed out, the foundation was inactive and not helping
kids. Gingrich took it over to save the time it would take to form
a new foundation. With that background, here's an exchange from
Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN:
<p>
<dd>
Bob Novak: "We have had debates at this table we've had
debates around town, over this shell of the Abraham Lincoln
Opportunity Foundation, which a lot of people have said Newt
looted of money for needy kids to give political contributions.
Your prosecutor, Mr. Cole, said that it was defunct. This is a
sham, and people who said he was looting money from kids, should
be ashamed of themselves, Al."
<br>
<dd>
Al Hunt: "He looted money from kids. I'll tell you exactly
what he did. This was set up, it didn't matter if it was defunct,
the Abraham Lincoln thing was set up to aid needy kids."
<br>
<dd>
Novak: "There was no money."
<br>
<dd>
Hunt: "Newt never went to the IRS, as he was required to by
law, and said we're going to take this thing that was set up for
needy kids and we're going to use it for partisan political
purposes."
<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Part three of the eight part Discovery Channel series,
Cronkite Remembers, offered a scary insight into the thinking of
reporters during the Cold War.
<br>
<dd>
The January 16 installment explored the Cold War era. Looking
at 1948, the year he returned from a Moscow reporting assignment,
Cronkite recalled: "It was great to be back in America. With the
GIs back home everything was expanding. More house, more babies,
more schools. It should have been the happiest of times, I guess,
but despite all the nation's optimism and new affluence there was
that chill in the air that just couldn't be ignored."
<p>
<dd>
Following some Soviet May Day video Cronkite continued:
<br>
<dd>
"I thought that we Americans overreacted to the Soviets and
the news coverage sometimes seemed to accentuate that misdirected
concern. Fear of the Soviet Union taking over the world just
seemed as likely to me as invaders from Mars. Well, perhaps I was
naive, but I'd seen those May Day parades and Soviet bread lines
and miserable conditions hidden behind them. That war-devastated
country didn't seem that threatening to me. United Press sent me
around speaking occasionally to various groups about life in the
Soviet Union. At almost all of the talks I was asked about Russian
technology and the prospects that they would develop an atomic
bomb. With great assurance, I would tell the questioner, 'no way,
no way, they can't even screw in a lightbulb.' I walked out of the
hall after one of those speeches and there were the headlines,
'Soviets Explode Atomic Bomb.' Another item for my cloudy crystal
ball department. 
<br>
<dd>
"The nuclear arms race was on in earnest. All the anti-Soviet
paranoia that had been festering since the war really blew up
then. A Soviet bomb was seen as an assault on us. But I saw it as
part of their pursuit of nuclear equality. After all, what should
we expect, that our enemy's just going to sit still there and not
try to develop the bomb?" 
<p>
<dd>
So, Americans had "overreacted" to the Soviet threat, but when
they did develop a nuclear weapon that didn't confirm the need for
concern, it "blew up" anti-Soviet "paranoia." And, what's the big
deal anyway? The Soviets deserved nuclear equality. 
<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) Mike Wallace did a piece for the January 19 60 Minutes on
the Ted Turner/Rupert Murdoch feud.
<p>
<dd>
Murdoch wouldn't talk to him, so Andrew Neal (sp?), a former
editor of one of Murdoch's London newspapers, served as the
Murdoch expert. After showing clips of some racy Fox entertainment
shows and explaining how Murdoch's London tabloid runs a topless
Page 3 Girl everyday, Wallace stated: 
<br>
<dd>
"I asked Andrew Neal how Murdoch, a conservative, can publish
papers and create programming that many conservatives find so
offensive. The buck is more important than his moral take on
life?"
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "You can't reconcile his private social views with what
he broadcasts and prints. His wife Anna is always pushing him to
end the topless girls in the Page 3 of the Sun tabloid in London
and he thinks about it. I remember him once saying we have to have
a moral compass, but at the end of the day we have to have a
bottom line."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Nothing, Neal says, nothing is more important in
Murdoch's life than winning."
<p>
<dd>
A few minutes later, Wallace took up Murdoch's political
views.
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "In the last election campaign Murdoch contributed
more than a million and a half dollars to political candidates,
most of them Republicans."
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "Rupert is a political ideologue. He has his right wing
Republican agenda."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Is it a fact that he once said that Oliver North,
quote 'deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor'?"
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "He thought Oliver North was one of the greatest heroes
in American history."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "He's genuinely a conservative?" 
<br>
<dd>
Neal: "When you regard Pat Robertson in 1988 as the best
Republican candidate you can see just how conservative he is.
Reagan was his hero. He hated Clinton."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Which was obvious during the election campaign to
readers of the Post."
<br>
<dd>
[Video of New York Post headline with photo of Clinton:
"America Decides: Is He Worthy?"
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "And on Murdoch's new cable channel the news also
comes with a conservative spin."
<br>
<dd>
Clip of Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel: "Those who are street
wise in America's big cities know that drug pushers and liquor
stores make a ton of money the day the welfare checks arrive. It's
a tough thing to say, but it's true."
<br>
<dd>
Wallace: "Ted Turner disdains all this. He believes Murdoch's
political bias contaminates his news coverage."
<br>
<dd>
Turner: "He looks down his nose at do-good, honest journalism.
He thinks that his media should be used by him to further his own
goals."
<p>
<dd>
This from a man who put Barbara Pyle in charge of CNN and TBS
environmental shows. In 1990 she boasted: "I feel that I'm here on
this planet to work in television, to be the little subversive
person in television. I've chosen television as my form of
activism. I felt that if I was to infiltrate anything, I'd do best
to infiltrate television."
<p>
<dd>
Two observations about the Wallace story:
<br>
<dd>
a) CBS won't concede any bias in 40 plus years of
broadcasting, not even in last year's Eric Engberg bashing of the 
flat tax which Bernard Goldberg was ostracized for calling biased,
but manages to find it on a four-month-old cable network.
<br>
<dd>
b) When Murdoch is liberal (Fox TV and sex in London tabloid)
it's because he wants to make money. But when what he does is
conservative (supposedly) Wallace assumes it's because Murdoch is
conservative. So if Murdoch's personal views effect his news
operations why can't the same be said off those overseeing every
other media outlet? 
<P>
<a name="7">
<dd>
7) In his new book Dick Morris reported that President
Clinton cannot type and thus writes his speeches on a notepad. In
her CBS Sunday Morning interview First Lady Hillary Clinton also
revealed that she's not quite up on modern technology. Discussing
what she'll do when daughter Chelsea goes to college in the fall,
she told Martha Teichner:
<br>
<dd>
"We'll just have to figure out as many ways as possible to
stay in touch with her, both through e-mail, which I know nothing
about but will have to learn, or through actual visits with her."
<p>
<dd>
They can't use computers. Just the kind of people to serve as
a bridge to the 21st century.

<P>
<a name="1">
<P>
1) Three big newspapers on Thursday, January 16 uncovered different 
new aspects in the John Huang/Democratic fundraising saga:
<ul>
<li>
    Thursday's Washington Post front page headline: "Guest Lists at White 
House Didn't Include Rap Sheets: Some at DNC Fund-Raising Coffees Ran Afoul
of Law." The Post reported that since full background checks were not run 
on large donors attending coffees with the President at the White House 
that some criminals got in to talk with Clinton.
<li>
    The Los Angeles Times front page: "Papers Show Huang's Policy Role at 
Commerce: Documents Contrast with Assertions that Figure in Democratic 
Fundraising Scandal Had Minimal Duties." 
<li>  
    Reporter Alan Miller's lead: "Newly disclosed Commerce Department 
documents indicate that controversial fundraiser John Huang was 
considered an expert on Asian affairs when he worked at the 
agency and had a voice in U.S.-Asia commercial policy, despite Clinton 
administration assertions that his duties there were largely administrative."</ul><dd>
Miller explained: "The issue is a sensitive one because of looming 
questions over whether Asian donors of large amounts of money later 
solicited by Huang were given insights into U.S. policy or other favors 
in return for their contributions." Further, Miller discovered that Huang 
retained his top secret clearance "for a year while he was raising money 
because Commerce officials failed to have it lifted."
<BR>
<DD>
    Offering an answer as to what influence Huang may have exerted, The 
Boston Globe's page one headline declared: "Clinton Policy Shift Followed 
Asian-American Fundraiser."
<BR>
<DD>    Reporter Michael Kranish began: "President Clinton made a last-minute 
about-face last year on his immigration policy, a reversal that brought 
the White House in line with the top priority of Asian-Americans who had
paid $12,500 each a month earlier to attend a fundraising dinner with
Clinton that generated $1.1 million. Clinton made his reversal after the 
Democratic National Committee Vice Chairman, John Huang, waged an intensive 
effort to influence Clinton's immigration policy, according to documents 
reviewed by the Globe."
Huang wanted to make sure the foreign born brothers and sisters of 
naturalized citizens could immigrate.
<BR>
<DD>
    Three big stories. How were they covered Thursday night? Let's go 
show by show:
<ul>
<li>ABC's World News Tonight: Nothing
<li>CBS Evening News: Nothing
<li>NBC Nightly News: Zilch
<li>CNN's The World Today (10-11pm ET): Not a word.</ul>
<DD>But CNN found time for a piece by Claire Shipman on how the White House 
handles 10,000 letters a day and who can reach Clinton through his personal
Zip code. Plus, at about 10:45 ET, a live report from Bob Franken on the status
of the still-to-be released special counsel report on Newt Gingrich.
<DD>It should be noted that CNN's Inside Politics did run a full report by 
Brooks Jackson examining the immigration story broken by the Boston Globe.<BR>
<P>
<a name="2">
<BR>
2) USA Today's Supreme Court reporter, Tony Mauro, is in love not 
with the law but with Laurence Tribe, the liberal Harvard law professor 
always on the Democratic list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Just 
try to make it through Mauro's assessment of Tribe's January 8 performance
as advocate for assisted suicide in oral argument before the Court. MRC 
media analyst, and aspiring personal injury lawyer, Steve Kaminski came 
across Mauro's oozings in the January 13 edition of Legal Times. Gushed 
Mauro:
<BR>
<DD>    "Tribe's detractors think his arrogance is finally catching up with him. 
'He was his usual glib self,' one veteran practitioner sniffed after the 
argument. But Tribe has a lot to be arrogant and glib about. There is 
still no one better on his feet, no one better able to respond to questions 
from the justices with a fully developed and usually persuasive response.
<BR>
<DD>    "But sometimes he seems too nimble, too cerebral, too able to see 
contradiction and ironies and nuances light-years before the justices and
other mere mortals are able to. Especially coming in the last quarter of a 
two-hour argument, he seemed to make the justices' heads hurt.
<BR>
<DD>    "Baryshnikov probably has had the same effect on dance aficionados -- 
too much dazzle to take all at once. Maybe Tribe needs to slow down and 
simplify his routine the next time out -- and dance the macarena instead 
of Swan Lake." 
<P>
<a name="3">      
<BR>
3) MRC media analyst Clay Waters caught two examples of reporters 
explaining away the offenses of Congressman Jim McDermott, the Democrat
accused of giving to the New York Times the tape of the Newt Gingrich 
cellular call. 
<BR>
<DD>
    First, on Thursday's CNN & Company Chicago Tribune reporter Ellen 
Warren insisted: "I'm not trying to minimize the offense here, though 
I would have to suggest that the ones of Speaker Gingrich look 
considerably more severe than Mr. McDermott's."
<BR>
<DD>
    Second, the January 16 New York Times included a news analysis 
piece from Adam Clymer, the reporter who wrote the January 10 story 
revealing the Gingrich phone conversation. Clymer lamented how the 
Gingrich ethics probe has been sidetracked. But instead of condemning 
McDermott or his own role in the process, Clymer said the Republicans 
were wrong on the substance. And he actually criticized Democrats for 
not being aggressive enough.
<BR>
<DD>    Clymer argued: "The case is also playing out on a more substantive
level, emerging as a test of the House's ability to perform its 
constitutional duty to judge and discipline its own members....
<BR>
<DD>    "As a political matter, the Republicans managed brilliantly 
on the last two weekends of television talk shows to keep the focus
where they wanted. First, they emphasized how trivial the charges against 
the Speaker were -- the phrase 'jaywalking ticket' was used to describe 
breaches of tax law and furnishing untrue information to the committee.
The next weekend they stressed how bad it was for a Democrat to 
make a taped telephone conversation public.
<BR>
<DD>    "Of course, they could not have done it without the Democrats' 
giving them a clear field. The first weekend the Democrats had 
available a Time magazine article suggesting that the leadership, 
possibly waving campaign money, put pressure on two ethics committee 
members to write an extraordinary letter telling colleagues to vote 
for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker. The Democrats hardly brought it up.
<BR>
<DD>    "Then last weekend the Democrats effectively failed to make their 
case that the taped conversation, whatever its ancestory, showed that 
Mr. Gingrich had broken his promises to the ethics committee."
<BR>
<DD>
    Allow me to interpret: Hey, Democrats, we in the media are doing
all we can to provide you with the ammunition to blast Newt out of 
the Speaker's chair, but you guys keep blowing it.<BR><P>

<u>Gumbel's Parting Shocker: I'm Not Conservative!</center></u><p>
<DD>
"I don't know if I have a liberal bent...But it is fair to say it's 
very difficult for a black man in this country to be of a conservative 
bent. That's a fair statement. It's very difficult to be an African-
American male, and have an African-American son who is going to be 
18 years of age, and hear things like cops want to crack down and 
send more to prison, to hear calls for tougher statutes, less welfare, 
less programs for the poor, and less things for people of color. 
If that says I'm not conservative, so be it."<br>
-- Bryant Gumbel in the January 2 USA Today, the day before his 
last morning as co-host of NBC's Today.<p>
<BR>
<center><u>Gingrich the Assassin</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>    
"Newt Gingrich's problem, I've always thought, he's like Lenin.
They both made a revolution by shooting people -- Newt shot
Democrats, Lenin shot everybody -- and then they didn't have
enough sense to stop shooting once they won. So, I mean, once you
win, you say, 'Okay, now I've shot all your relatives, but you're
a good guy, let's work together.' Instead, Newt shut down the
government and kept on trying to shoot Democrats."
-- ABC's Sam Donaldson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, January 8.</p>
<DD><p>
Margaret Carlson, Time: "If we didn't have Newt Gingrich having
brought down Jim Wright on, on, I think, picayune, as picayune as
this, then I think there would be less hostility towards him at
this moment."
<BR>
<DD>
Andrew Ferguson, The Weekly Standard: "Jim Wright was trying to
line his own pockets in the most sordid, squalid sort of way...."
Carlson: "But he [Gingrich] was lining his own personal power
pockets, which is just as bad."<br>
-- December 28 Capital Gang on CNN.<p></p>
<DD>"Not just maybe from a technical point of view, but you had the
Speaker, somebody who led the assault on Jim Wright, he never
ended up getting prosecuted, he never broke the law. Doesn't the
Speaker's credibility kind of get diminished by this and doesn't
he become a symbol of somebody who broke the rules as opposed to
somebody who followed the rules? Doesn't this give you a
credibility problem?"<br>
-- CBS reporter Rita Braver to U.S. Rep Chris Shays (R-Conn.), 
December 29 Face the Nation.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Cronkite the Censor</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"It's [the Internet] at the moment highly dangerous; I hope that
we pacify it in the near future. A three-page, very slickly done
presentation alleged that I was drunk in an Orlando restaurant
and spit in a man's soup. And no way to trace it whatsoever. It
seems to me that these sources of so called information should
have to identify themselves. There should be a sense of
responsibility placed upon them to stand behind what they report.
I just abhor any form of censorship, but I do not think there's
anything wrong at all with banning anonymous information."<br>

<br>
Most Decisive Campaign Moment: "Sadly, the flap over the
Indonesian campaign contributions. The only thing that moved the

conditioned by nearly half a century of cold war. Strength and
toughness trumped everything else. At one military briefing
during the 1980s, Reagan was shown models of American missiles.
The American power phalluses were long and white; the Soviets',
shorter and black. We were still safely ahead, but only by the
margin of our machismo."<br>

<br>  December 30, 1996/January 6, 1997 issue. <p>

"There's an ethnic undertone to this. If these were Greeks, or
American Jews, or Irish-Americans rather than Asian, some of this
wouldn't have the same undertones."<br>
-- Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau Chief Doyle McManus on 
Indogate/Donorgate,<br>   January 4 Inside Washington.<p>
<BR>
<DD>
"I'll take Phil Gramm. Buchanan was always a sideshow and a
cartoon. But Gramm was serious, but a serious divider. He was a
classic wedge-issue politician that would have driven us apart."<br>

most pleased left the presidential race, Dec. 28.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Criminal Welfare Reform Will Bring Starvation</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"The most shameful act of '96 was welfare reform....welfare
reform became a political football in '96, an easy way to kick
around the poor and especially poor children and immigrants, even
legal immigrants. Bill Clinton thought the GOP had a hot issue,
so he closed his eyes and signed a bill that punishes children
and people who want to work, but can't find a job in a tough
market for entry level employment. This was a criminal act,
further dividing us as haves and have nots. It was shameful."<br>
-- Washington Post reporter Juan Williams on CNN's Capital Gang,
December 29.<p>
<BR>
<DD>       
"Welfare Ends. Acknowledging that the new law was 'seriously
flawed,' President Clinton signed it anyway, ending welfare as we
know it....Supporters said the new law would get people on their
feet, but criticism came from many quarters: from states that
said they couldn't meet the deadlines, from social workers who
said the new system will plunge more people into poverty, from
three top federal officials who resigned in protest. 'I think a
lot of people will start starving,' said Shawn Cornett, a
22-year-old welfare recipient in Kentucky."<br>
-- AP reporter Helen O'Neill in year-end story summarizing the 
top ten stories of 1996.<p>
<BR>

<center><u>Bombing Bob Dornan</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"Robert Dornan. B-1 Bob went ballistic after narrowly losing his
House seat in Orange County, California, to Hispanic financial
analyst Loretta Sanchez. Threatening to sue her for election
fraud, Dornan called Sanchez a 'liar' and said 'the whole thing
stinks to high heaven.' Of course, sour grapes were to be
expected from the former fighter pilot who once grabbed a fellow
Congressman by the collar and called him a 'draft-dodging wimp.'
Sanchez's campaign manager, John Sullivan, spoke for many when he
said of Dornan, 'He's been, and continues to be, a national
disgrace. All we can say is Adios.' The bad news is that Dornan
will now have more time for his second job as Rush Limbaugh's
substitute host."<br> 
-- Time on "Worst Public Performances of 1996," December 23.

<center><u>"Growing" Left</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"[Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu was a possibility because his
election was quite a surprise. He had a lot of people hoping that
he would in fact grow in the job and become a peacemaker and so
far that hasn't happened."<br>
-- Time Deputy Managing Editor James Kelley, CNN's Time "Man of 
the Year" special, Dec. 23.<p> 
<BR>

<center><u>Media Bias: A Ditsy Notion</u></center>
<BR>
<DD>
"The latter [Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes] has made his fervent
mantra the ditsy notion of the media having perverted the United
States by being a cesspool of lefty ideologues. Sure, as in ABC's
David Brinkley publicly calling President Clinton a bore."<br>

<P>
Bryant Gumbel:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>

Jimmy Carter:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>

Gumbel:
<P>

 "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?"

"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <DD>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.
<P>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <DD>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.
<P>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?"
<DD>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.

"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he
defends the tobacco interests...Yes! He got his job under very
seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <DD>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.
<P>
<br>
<b>vs.</b>
<P>
<br>
"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <DD>-- Clift, later in the same show.

<CENTER><H3>Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <DD>-- New

memoirs, October 20.

<CENTER><H3>It's Her Ideas, Stupid</H3></CENTER>
<P>

CBS reporter Rita Braver:
<blockquote>
<P>
 "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
</blockquote>
<P>
Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
"So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out."

<CENTER><H3>Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <DD>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <DD>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."
<P>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <DD>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.
<p>
<BR>
<B>Reality Check: </B>
<br>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss."<DD> -- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Very Questionable Sources of Information</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <DD>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.
<P>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <DD>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.

CNN's Brooks Jackson is usually one of the most balanced
and least gullible reporters on TV, taking on the campaign
rhetoric of both sides. But on Friday's (December 6) Inside
Politics he seemed to have let down his guard.
<P>
    Sitting beside substitute anchor Charles Bierbauer, he told
viewers: "Well, Charles, one of the more bizarre episodes may have
gotten a little less bizarre today. Back in October, attention
focused on the Buddhist temple in California where Democrats
raised $140,000 in an event attended by Vice President Al Gore.
The Wall Street Journal, back then, quoted a Buddhist nun who had
given $5,000 as saying the money was not hers, that it had been
given to her by the real donor who did not want to be identified.
But that would be illegal, so that was news, embarrassing to the
Vice President and to the Democratic Party. Now, that Buddhist nun
has changed her story and is saying the money was hers all along.
We are told she has filed a statement with the Federal Election
Commission, which is investigating, saying the money came not from
some secret donor but from her own savings and from offerings of
persons who supported her work at the temple, Charles."
<P>
<blockquote>
    Charles Bierbauer: "And, why do we suppose Brooks that she
might have once told the Wall Street Journal the money was not
hers?"
<P>
    Jackson: "We are told in this statement that she didn't know
quite how to handle a call from this national news reporter and
told what she hoped, or thought, was a harmless lie just to get
him off the phone. Turns out it was not so harmless."
<P>
</blockquote>
    How about a more logical scenario: When called by the reporter
she innocently told the truth. After DNC lawyers panicked they
came up with a legal explanation. Indeed, the December 2 Wall
Street Journal reported that "Democratic lawyer Peter Kelly"
became "closely involved with" allegations "that fraudulent
contributions may have been made to the Democratic Party during a
fundraising event at a Buddhist temple in California. 
<blockquote>    
<P>
"Mr. Kelly is a prominent Democratic fundraiser himself and
attended the temple event. After the controversy broke, he emerged
as the temple's lawyer...On the day that this newspaper published
a front page article quoting a Buddhist monk, Man Yah Shih, saying
she gave $5,000 at the fundraiser with money that wasn't hers, Mr.
Kelly called the woman and questioned her and was told
subsequently the same thing. Ms. Shih then left her temple for a
'retreat' overseas, from which she didn't return until after the
election. She now won't talk to reporters, referring all calls to
Mr. Kelly."

Here's a sentence apparently thought "outlandish" by New
York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse: "The powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people."
<P>
    That's the 10th Amendment. Here's her take on the Supreme
Court's review of the Brady gun control law. From the December 6
Washington Week in Review on PBS:
<blockquote>
<P>  
  "The Brady gun control law has been challenged, on of all
things, not on gun control grounds, but on federalism grounds, on
states rights grounds, because the bill has a provision that
requires local Sheriffs, the local law enforcement officials, to
do the background checks during the five day waiting period to
make sure a prospective gun purchaser is not a convicted felon.
And the local Sheriffs, backed by the National Rifle Association,
are arguing that this violates states rights because it in effect
is a commandeering by the federal government of the processes of
local government to make the locals officials do the Fed's work. 
And on the face of it, it sounds like a sort of outlandish
argument, you know, what local law enforcement officials do is
background checks, it's a very common kind of procedure. But this
argument has a lot of force these days because this case is part
on an ongoing review at the court and in the federal courts
generally about the whole relationship between the state and
federal government. So it's quite a potent argument, actually."

Sunday's Reliable Sources showed how the CNN program,
which is supposed to critique the news media, does anything but as
panelists pounce on anyone who dares draw attention to bias. 
<P>
    The December 8 guest panelist: former Washington Post reporter
William Powers, fresh from his inaugural New Republic piece on the
media. He's now a Senior Editor of the magazine. Regulars Marty
Schram of Scripps Howard, Bernard (I only own rust colored ties)
Kalb, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post as well as Jane Shaw of
the Los Angles Times spent an entire segment attacking Powers. One
by one they argued how preposterous they found his thesis.
<P>
    And what did Powers assert? In his December 16 New Republic
piece he showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton character
issue during the campaign. After explaining how Clinton staffers 
convinced network producers to not air some stories, Powers 
explained:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "Why, besides the skill of its practitioners, has the White
House 'outreach' worked so well? Simply put, because Clinton and
his people are, to most journalists, culturally sympathetic. What
every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every
reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal.
Most Washington reporters share with the Clinton aides a language,
a value system, a set of buttons. Outrage at, say, 'partial birth
infanticide' is not one of the buttons of this class. Outrage at
'right-wing abortion activists' is.
<P>
    "When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal
journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they
are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no
plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held
they're mostly unconscious. All of which means that, had a
Republican President been up for re-election this year, facing the
same array of ethical problems Clinton faced, the scandals would
have gotten more ink. Recall the alacrity with which the
journalism establishment seized on the sexual allegations against
Clarence Thomas, John Tower and Bob Packwood."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Of course the MRC has never seen a plot, but it would be nice
if some media people of influence would realize this "unconscious"
bias before we put "former" before their name.

Thought you could escape from Bryant Gumbel after January
3, his last Today day? Friday's New York Post brought bad news.
The Post's Josef Adalian reported: 
<blockquote>
<P>
"There's an increasingly hard-to- ignore buzz among ABC News staffer that a deal between soon-to-depart 
Today show anchor Bryant Gumbel and ABC could be a match made in 
Nielsen heaven....Over the last few days speculation among ABC News 
insiders has become commonplace that...network execs are more than 
willing to guarantee Gumbel a 10pm Thursday newsmagazine showcase 
on ABC."

<a name="COLA">
1) A congressionally appointed panel reported Wednesday that
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has overstated inflation, thus
leading to higher than necessary entitlement program payments. For
1996 they estimated the CPI was 1.1 percent too high. ABC and CBS
approached the issue not from the view of saving taxpayer money
but from the perspective of what recipients will lose and how such
an adjustment will mean more money for the government -- as if
it's the government's money that's being improperly spent. 
<P>
<DD>
    Here's how Peter Jennings led the December 4 World News
Tonight: "We begin tonight with money. Maybe a little less for
you, depending on who you are, and certainly a little more for
Uncle Sam."
<BR>
<DD>
    Reporter Lisa Stark then explained how "One third of the
federal budget is tied to the CPI, so cutting the official
inflation measurement 1.1 percent would lower all government
payments based on the cost of living, saving the government a
trillion dollars over the next twelve years. But cutting those
payments would affect 60 million Americans, including seniors who
stand to lose an average of $100 dollars a year in Social
Security."
<BR>
<DD>
    Patrick Burns of the National Council of Senior Citizens then
asserted: "It's a very simple, stealth, back door way of balancing
the budget. And it's really not based on science, it's based o
political opportunism."
<P>
<DD>
    Of course seniors wouldn't "lose" $100. They'll still get a
hike from the current payment.
<P>
<DD>
    On Wednesday's CBS Evening News Dan Rather, as usual,
forwarded the victim angle: "A plan officially proposed in
Washington today could effect the incomes of millions of
Americans, especially those older or at the lower end of the
economic scale." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Ray Brady elaborated: "From seniors to taxpayers, a special
congressional commission fired a shot today that could be felt by
anyone getting a government check."
<p>
<dd>
    Brady aired a soundbite from commission head Michael Boskin:
"The Consumer Price Index is substantially, substantially
overstating the true change in the cost of living by about 1.1
percentage points per year."
<br>
<dd>
    Brady continued: "Sound like economic gobbledygook? The
Consumer Price Index is the nation's main measure of inflation.
Government statisticians use it to figure out how much to pay in
food stamps, school lunches and Social Security, all of which go
up or down with inflation. Take the average Social Security check:
It will rise from $724 to $745 dollars a month in January, but it
would rise to just $737 dollars, a difference of eight dollars if
the congressional commission has its way."
<br>
<dd>
    Margrit Pittman, a Social Security recipient at a senior's
center illustrated the point: "For many people who come here,
eight dollars a month is a big loss. That may be the only eight
dollars they have to ever go to the movies."
<P>
<DD>
    There you have it. Transfer $13 per month more to Social
Security recipients, instead of $21 more, and they'll no longer be
able to see a movie. 
<P>
<a name="Dornan">
2) In his Monday (December 2) USA Today "Politics" column
reporter Richard Benedetto favorably examined the Carl Rowan and
Georgie Ann Geyer books which contend racial/ethnic tensions are
rising. Near the end Benedetto asserted: "Despite the authors'
bleak outlook, however, there were signs of hope in the last
elections." Benedetto cited three examples: First, five black
Congressmen won majority white districts; second, an Asian won the
race for Governor of Washington; and third:
<BR>
<DD>
    "Newly registered Hispanic-American voters provided critical
votes in many elections, most notably in the defeat of the
bombastic Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif."
<P>
<a name="foodstamps">
3) An editorial in the December 4 Washington Times noted
that Congressional Budget Office figures show "that the net effect
of welfare reform will be to increase annual federal poverty
spending by 7 percent per year through 2002." AFDC, food stamps,
Medicaid, SSI, child nutrition, etc. "will increase by 50 percent
from $198 billion in 1996 to $297 billion in 2002. With inflation
projected to average 2.8 percent a year, the 7 percent nominal
increase in federal poverty spending translates into an inflation-
adjusted increase of more than 4 percent a year."
<P>
<DD>
    That isn't the picture portrayed on network news. On the
Thanksgiving Day CBS Evening News substitute anchor Harry Smith
announced: "For the first time in decades the federal government
will no longer guarantee open-ended help to the poor. Case in 
point, food stamps. As Diana Olick reports, this could mean hunger
in America will grow, even in places famous for food and plenty of it."
<BR>
<DD>
    MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed Olick's report from New
Orleans. She began: "In a city that celebrates every street
corner, where Cajun spice walks out of every doorway and century
old eateries lure patrons from all walks of life a drafty downtown
soup kitchen is preparing for an onslaught."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick went on to explain that "On March 1st, a provision in the
new welfare reform law will cut off food stamps to all able bodied 
adults ages 18 to 50 with no dependents, who don't have a job."
She found one not-so-hard working victim: "37 year old Denise Lee
has been on food stamps most of her life. She doesn't want to
work, but she's now planning to get a job. She fears though that
others will turn to crime instead to pay for food."
<br>
<dd>
    Denise Lee: "They say times is hard and crime is up and this
and that but they ain't seen nothing yet. They ain't seen
nothing."
<br>
<dd>
   Olick: "In the 35 year history of the food stamp program there
has never been a cut this drastic. More than one million people
nationwide will be affected. That's nearly 2,000 people in New
Orleans alone. But lawmakers say this cut is critical and the 
success of the welfare overhaul is riding on it."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick then allowed Ohio Congressman Robert Ney to argue: "This
is going to force the federal government, and the state
government, and the local government right down to the most local
levels to talk about how to help people, how to have opportunity."
<br>
<dd>
    Olick concluded "The cut in food stamps will force many people
to go to work. But in New Orleans, where there are more people
than jobs, some, like Denise Lee are worrying how they will carry
this new financial burden once the government stops carrying 
them. Diana Olick, CBS News, New Orleans."
<p>
<dd>
    Only at CBS is a 4 percent increase considered a "drastic
cut."
<P>
<a name="Atlanta">
4) Continuing CBS's victimization theme, MRC analyst Steve
Kaminski caught this story on homeless which aired on the December
1 CBS Evening News. Anchor John Roberts began: "All big cities
have homeless people, it's a growing problem marked by
controversy. What to do about it? Well, the city of Atlanta has an
answer: outlaw homelessness. But that approach, says Jim Axelrod,
is causing even more controversy."
<P>
<DD>
   Reporter Axelrod started by showing viewers a mother with kids
who must ride a bus each night to find shelter: "Like most
families, Xena Hampton and her kids have a bedtime ritual. Unlike
most families, their ritual is boarding a bus to find a bed.
Which, this night, takes them twenty miles away. They are
homeless, and now a new law could make them criminals."
<br>
<dd>
    Anita Beatty, homeless taskforce: "It's immoral, it's
unethical, it's, most probably, unconstitutional."
<br>
<dd>
    After another soundbite from a homeless advocate, Axelrod
continued: "The biggest problem Atlanta's homeless advocates have
with the new law is that most people targeted have nowhere else to
go. The shelters here, they say, have enough beds for one out of
seven people who need them."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod allowed Atlanta Council President Marvin Arrington
explain: "You've got to get up and go to work every day and that's
not being inhumane, that's caring about yourself and caring 
about the environment that you live in."
<br>
<dd>
    Axelrod also aired a clip of a Wendy's manager complaining
about a homeless man urinating in front of his restaurant, but
proceeded to end with a hit on the law: "Opponents of the law will
now head to the courts worried that Atlanta's solution to this
problem will soon spread across the country. Jim Axelrod CBS 
News, Atlanta." 
<br>
<dd>
We'll never run out of victims for CBS to portray.

Gumbel's Morning Devotions
<BR>
<DD>
<i>Bryant Gumbel:</i> "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Jimmy Carter:</i> "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<br>
<dd>
<i>Gumbel:</i> "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general view.
What do you think, if anything, that says about the power of
prayer?" -- Exchange on Today about Carter's new book, Living
Faith, November 18.
<p>
<dd>
Time Does DNC Damage Control
<br>
<dd>
"In the realm of honest graft, Clinton didn't do anything Bob Dole
didn't do; he and his party just did it with the seal of the White
House behind them." <i>-- Time's Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs,
November 11.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"The intricate squalor of Democratic fundraising is the news of
the moment. But here's the big surprise: funny money is a
bipartisan indulgence. Here's another: Bob Dole -- gasp! -- is in
on the game. For most of his Senate career, Dole was the pro of
the quid pro quo. No one else has been more effective at working
the filigree of legislation, digging out just the groove to let
the American government's generosity flow unimpeded to his most
loyal supporters. And the GOP generally has engaged for years in
imaginative fundraising, and favors trading that would make
anybody blush." <i>-- Time's Richard Lacayo, next page.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Fortunately for Clinton, Dole had already blocked
campaign-finance reform and stuffed his pockets. (Ever hear of the
sugar-growing Cuban immigrant contributor or the $6 million fine
for a Republican with a money-laundering operation in Hong Kong?)"
<i>-- Time columnist Margaret Carlson, same issue.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Eleanor "Sybil" Clift
<br>
<dd>
"Let's define what we mean by attacks on Kenneth Starr. It's fair
game to point out that he is a partisan Republican, that he

seamy circumstances. That's fair game." <i>-- Newsweek's Eleanor
Clift on the November 16 McLaughlin Group.</i>

"Watergate was a criminal conspiracy conducted out of the Oval
Office. There is nothing even remotely like that alleged against
this President. We ought to wait and see what Ken Starr says. He's
the only one who has credibility, in my mind, in bringing forth
this investigation." <i>-- Clift, later in the same show.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fabulous Clinton Cabinet
<br>
<dd>
"Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the
Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any
more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who
is the Treasury Secretary?" <i>-- Tom Brokaw during NBC News election
night coverage.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Gorbachev, Impeccable Overachiever
<br>
<dd>
"It mystifies Westerners that Mikhail Gorbachev is loathed and
ridiculed in his own country. This is the man who pulled the world
several steps back from the nuclear brink and lifted a crushing
fear from his countrymen, who ended bloody foreign adventures,
liberated Eastern Europe and won for the Soviet Union at least
provisional membership in the club of civilized nations. By the
standards of the West (and by comparison with the incumbent, Boris
Yeltsin), Mr. Gorbachev is a man of impeccable character." <i>-- New
York Times foreign editor Bill Keller reviewing Gorbachev's
memoirs, October 20.</i>
<p>
<dd>
It's Her Ideas, Stupid
<br>
<dd>
<i>CBS reporter Rita Braver:</i> "But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still
stirs up controversy at home. In a Time magazine interview she
talked about her plans to travel the U.S., monitoring the
administration's new welfare reform policies. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is to never express opinions or ideas."
<i>Hillary Clinton:</i> "So it's a kind of difficult position and I think
the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you do and
get through it and wait for the first man to hold the position and
see how it turns out." <i>-- CBS Evening News story, November 25.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Alger Hiss: Just Caught Up in Cold War Hysteria
<br>
<dd>
"One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has died.
Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of rising
prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was caught up
in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member of the
Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass State
Department secrets to the Soviets....Despite the support of many
prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this country,
but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB archives,
saying that Hiss had never been a spy." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, November 15
NBC Nightly News. On November 18 Brokaw noted that "the Russian
General admitted he didn't have access to all records."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until a man
named Whittaker Chambers accused him of being a communist who
passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional hearings
Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon. Hiss was
ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood and his
marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end and last
year we reported that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim." <i>-- Peter Jennings,
November 15 World News Tonight. On November 19 Jennings issued a
"clarification," noting that "It was actually a member of Mr.
Yeltsin's staff, General Dmitri Volkogonov, who made the
statement. He later said that the evidence wasn't conclusive."</i>
<br>
<dd>
"Hiss was a Harvard-educated lawyer with a distinguished career in
government when he was accused in 1948 of helping pass secret
documents to the Soviets. The case attracted national attention
and helped spur a period of blacklisting and hysteria over the
communist threat." <i>-- CNN Prime News anchor Linden Soles, November 15.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Reality Check:
<br>
<dd>
"For the last forty years...Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so-called Venona
files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent from the
Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated 30 March
1945, talks about the activities of a high level State Department
official turned Soviet agent code named A-L-E-S, Ales. His travel
schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the bottom of the cable,
there's a notation by an officer at the National Security Agency
saying Ales was probably, quote, Alger Hiss." <i>-- Meet the Press
host Tim Russert, November 24.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Very Questionable Sources of Information
<br>
<dd>
"This is the problem with the Internet: wonderful in some ways,
but more crazy conspiracy theories float around. If you get your
information from talk radio and the Internet, you believe a lot of
this nutty stuff." <i>-- Newsweek's Evan Thomas on Pierre Salinger's
TWA 800 missile claim, November 10 Inside Washington.</i>
<br>
<dd>
"But in the end, one is left with a nagging sense that the
Dole-Kemp plan doesn't add up...and with a troubling question.
Having already tried supply-side tax cuts as the route to renewed
economic glory only to discover the nation strapped with
historically large deficits, why would we do it again?" <i>-- Peter
G. Gosselin on the Dole-Kemp campaign manifesto Trust the People,
November 3 New York Times Book Review.</i>
<p>
<dd>
Fashionably Feminist Fertility

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT>On Monday's CBS Evening News (November 25), 
Rita Braver reviewed First Lady Hillary Clinton's activities while
accompanying the President in Asia. Braver relayed that 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Her theme has been equality and opportunity for women, whether
speaking to thousands or to just a few. In Bangkok, she
comforted a former prostitute now dying of AIDS. And 
later made the point that if women are educated they are not
forced to turn to prostitution."  
 </blockquote>
<P>    
Following a clip of Mrs. Clinton, Braver continued:
 <P>
<blockquote>    
"But even abroad, Mrs. Clinton still stirs up controversy at
home. In a Time magazine interview, she talked about her plans
to travel the U.S., monitoring the administration's new welfare
reform policies. The White House immediately denied that 
the First Lady will have any formal role. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton
best expressed her own awkward situation when she told an
Australian audience that the only way for a First Lady to escape
criticism is never to express opinions or ideas."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Hillary Clinton:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "So it's a kind of difficult position and I
think the only answer is to just be who you are and do what you
do and get through it and wait for the first man to hold the
position and see how that turns out."
<P> 
</blockquote>   
Braver: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"And sources close to the First Lady say she is
still struggling to define exactly what her role will be in her
husbands next term. How to do work that is important 
but not controversial. Rita Braver CBS News, Bangkok, Thailand."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Hmmm. Maybe it's not that she expresses ideas, maybe it's
the socialist ideas that she expresses that people don't like.

A CyberAlert recipient alerted me to a November 25
Reuters story on the same topic that he saw in Yahoo, from where
I downloaded the story headlined "Hillary's Role on Welfare
Played Down."
<P>
    The piece, datelined Manila, began: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
was at the center of a new controversy on Monday after she
suggested she wanted a 'formal role' in shaping policy on U.S.
welfare reform."
<P>
    Several paragraphs later the Reuters dispatch asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A draconian welfare reform measure passed by the Republican
Congress and signed into law by Clinton at the height of the
U.S. presidential campaign in October ends a 60-year guarantee
of federal aid to the poor. It is expected to deprive at least a
million people of public assistance over the next few years."

 Monday's resignation by FDA Commissioner David Kessler
received full stories on all the evening newscasts November 25.
But NBC's Robert Hager provided the most glowing assessment of
the man who fought to expand the agency's regulatory power.
<P>
    As transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi, here's Hager's NBC
Nightly News story:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Kessler was controversial from the start, loved going after
the big guys, set the tone immediately six years ago by telling
Proctor & Gamble to get the word 'fresh' off its frozen orange
juice. When the company ignored him, Kessler began seizing the
product. P&G backed down. Later Kessler reformed the way we
label all foods, developed a whole new system for listing fat,
cholesterol, and nutrients. Kessler had a law degree from the
University of Chicago and an MD from Harvard Medical. And he was
bipartisan too, appointed by the Republican Bush, kept on by the
Democrat Clinton."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Hager continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "But all this was prelude to his landmark
decision to go after big tobacco, some of the nation's
wealthiest corporations. Call cigarettes a drug, he said, and
regulate them. It had been assumed that Kessler would stay in
office to defend the new regulations from tobacco companies and
see the regulations implemented, perhaps some, by next spring.
But he's reportedly being pursued by several universities and
his wife, once a Manhattan lawyer, is known to have tired of
Washington politics. Also there was recent flap over some of his
expense accounts uncovering dozens of errors and forcing Kessler
to write an $850 reimbursement check to the government. And all
along Kessler had no shortage of detractors."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Following a soundbite from Newt Gingrich on how Kessler was
too cautious in approving drugs and praise from Congressman
Henry Waxman, Hager concluded: "So Kessler will move on, leaving
history to judge the difference he may have made in American
health."
<P>
    Hager spent so much time hyping Kessler's activities as
accomplishments that NBC viewers never learned the other side
from those who thought Kessler symbolized the worst of the
nanny-state. As a November 27 Boston Herald editorial argued:
<P>
<blockquote>
"He thought -- he said -- the brand name 'Fresh Choice' was
misleading. Never mind that right under the name it said 'made
from concentrate.' With no evidence of harm but anecdotes spread
by plaintiffs lawyers so cherished by the Clinton
administration, Kessler ordered silicone breast implants off the
market. After the publication of two impeccable studies that
demolished the case against implants, Kessler has declined to
end the ban, condemning thousands of women to inferior
substitutes."

 Discussing politics with husband and wife team James
Carville and Mary Matalin on the November 24 Meet the Press,
host Tim Russert asked Matalin: 
<P>
<blockquote>
    "A week before the inauguration in January, the Supreme
Court's going to hear arguments about sexual harassment charges
filed by Paula Jones. Stuart Taylor in the American Lawyer, a
long piece where he lays out the charges by Paula Jones against
Bill Clinton, Anita Hill against Clarence Thomas and says the
evidence involving Jones is overwhelming compared to that of
Anita Hill. Mary Matalin, how big of a political story 
and a media story is this going to be?"
</blockquote>
<P>   
 Well, so far it hasn't been much of one. As far as I've seen
it still hasn't been mentioned on Nightly News or Today. In
fact, the only broadcast network coverage it's gotten was in a
late October World News Tonight story in which ABC's Jeff
Greenfield used the lack of coverage given the blockbuster
article as an example of why conservatives see liberal bias.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)  </FONT>Later in the same Meet the Press (November 24) Russert
played a tape of Whittaker Chambers on the old Meet the Press
radio show during which he accused Alger Hiss of being a spy.
<P>
    Two points here. First, reporters were as skeptical about
the guilt of Hiss in 1948 as they were this year when he died.
Second, after the clip, Russert actually laid out the evidence,
something Nightly News never did.
<P>
    From the Friday, August 27, 1948 at 10pm Meet the Press
radio show, here are some of the questions posed to Chambers:   
<P>
Nat Finney, Cowles Publications:
<blockquote>
<P> "I thought you left it a
little unclear as to whether you are certain in your mind, now,
whether Alger Hiss is now a member of the Communist Party or
not."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"I would not presume to say whether Mr. Hiss is or
is not a member of the Communist Party."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Finney:
<P>
<blockquote> "You mean to say that you have not made a check to
find out whether he, as you, has recanted."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I have no possibility of making such a charge.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities subpoenaed me to
tell what I knew about the Communist Party at the time that Mr.
Hiss was a member. I have testified on that, I have not 
presumed to testify what he is now."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Tom Reynolds, Chicago Sun-Times:
<P>
<blockquote> "Are you prepared at this
time, to say that Alger Hiss was anything more than, in your
opinion, a Communist? Did he do anything wrong? Did he commit
any overt act? Has he been disloyal to his country?"
</blockquote>
<P>    
Chambers:
<P>
<blockquote> "I am only prepared, at this time, to say that he
was a Communist."
</blockquote>
<P>    
Reynolds:
<P>
<blockquote> "It seems to me then sir, if I may say so, that in
some respects this may be a tempest in a teapot. You say that
you think he was a Communist, you say he was a Communist but you
will not accuse him of any act that is disloyal to the United
States."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Chambers: 
<P>
<blockquote>"I am not prepared, legally, to make that charge.
My whole interest in this business has been to show that Mr.
Hiss was a Communist."
   </blockquote>
<P>
    Back to 1996, Russert explained that "Hiss sued Whittaker
Chambers for slander, for what he said on Meet the Press"
and Hiss was later convicted of perjury for his congressional
testimony "because the statute of limitations on espionage had
expired."
 <P>
    Russert then explained: "For the last 40 years until he died
last week at age 92, Alger Hiss proclaimed his innocence. But
this year, the CIA declassified and released the so called 
Venona files, translations of actual intercepts of messages sent
from the Soviet Embassy in Washington back to Moscow. One, dated
30 March, 1945, talks about the activities of a high level State 
Department official, turned Soviet agent, code named A-L-E-S,
ALES. His travel schedule matched that of Alger Hiss. At the
bottom of the cable, there's a notation by an officer at 
the National Security Agency saying ALES, A-L-E-S was probably,
quote Alger Hiss." 
<P>
    As you saw in past CyberAlerts, when Hiss died Tom Brokaw
said he was "caught up" in a spy scandal. NBC Nightly News made
no mention of the Venona files. In fact, when they were released
this past Spring, of the broadcast networks, only the CBS
Evening News did a story (by David Martin).

The last CyberAlert reported how Peter Jennings and Tom
Brokaw last Friday (November 15) suggested Alger Hiss was
vindicated before his death. Tom Brokaw said Hiss was innocently
"caught up in a spy scandal" and "considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General...saying that Hiss had never
been a spy." Jennings claimed that "Boris Yeltsin said that KGB
files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim" of innocence.
<P>
    Since then I've come across another instance of a network
assuming he was victimized by anti-communism. On Friday's The
News with Brian Williams last week on MSNBC substitute anchor
Brigitte Quinn told viewers, as transcribed by MRC intern Joe
Alfonsi:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "Alger Hiss was a symbol of the cold war and the McCarthy
witch hunts that haunted that era. And his public disgrace
propelled Richard Nixon to the White House. Hiss died today at 
a New York City hospital. He was four days shy of his 93rd
birthday. Hiss was a brilliant lawyer and teacher until 1948 when
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused Hiss of giving him State
Department secrets to pass to the Soviets. An ambitious
Congressman named Richard Nixon lead the prosecution against
Hiss, who was convicted and sent to prison. The publicity helped
win Nixon the vice presidential nomination in 1952. As for Hiss,
he fought for vindication for the rest of his life. In 1987 a
Russian General declared that Hiss was never a spy but a victim
of cold war hysteria."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Did she say 1987? Yes, she did.   
<P>
    On Monday's NBC Nightly News (November 18), Tom Brokaw issued
a correction:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Last week on this program we reported on the death of Alger
Hiss, the establishment intellectual who was the center of a long
bitter debate about his Communist Party credentials and suspected
Soviet spy activity. Late in his life, we reported, he felt
vindicated by a Russian General's claim that there were no
records to support the claims that Hiss was a spy. However, the 
Russian General admitted he didn't have access to all records."
<P>
</blockquote>
    The next night, Tuesday, November 19, Peter Jennings got
around to noting his error. On World News Tonight he stated:
<P>
<blockquote>    
"We have a clarification tonight of something we reported on 
Friday. In the obituary of Alger Hiss, we reported that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had said that KGB files supported Hiss'
contention that he had never spied for the Soviets as he insisted
all his life. It was actually a member of Mr. Yeltsin's staff,
General Dmitri Volkogonov who made the statement. He later said
that the evidence wasn't conclusive because there were other
Soviet intelligence agencies whose files were not available."
</blockquote>
<P>    
The networks have now conceded the evidence of his innocence
is not solid, but viewers never a got a full understanding of the
depth of proof of his guilt.

 Revelations about John Huang continue to make the front
pages of newspapers, but the television networks have nearly
blacked out the entire scandal. Last week we reported that of the
broadcast network evening shows only ABC's World News Tonight, on
November 12, reported that the Commerce Dept. had launched an
investigation of John Huang to see if he really cut off ties to
the Lippo Group. The last CyberAlert detailed how a series of
revelations in the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New
York Times never made it onto the ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows. 
<P>
    Picking up where that list left off, here's a run down on
coverage this week that I compiled with the assistance of MRC
analysts Steve Kaminski and Gene Eliasen. This review includes the
three evening shows, plus CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) as well
as GMA, This Morning and Today from Sunday through Thursday.
<P>
<blockquote>  
<UL>
<LI>  In five mornings, GMA mentioned Huang in one newscast one
morning. Today and CBS This Morning devoted half of one story.
<LI> In five evenings, ABC raised Huang in two anchor-read
items. CBS devoted one full story. In four nights (no Nightly
News on Sunday) NBC aired one anchor-read brief. 
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Sunday, November 17.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
The day after the front page of the New York Times reported that President Clinton 
had met with and discussed Indonesian policy with James Riady, the former employer
of John Huang. Also, the DNC announced that Huang was let go as
part of post-election reductions.
<P> 
       CNN's The World Today and ABC's World News Tonight: Brief
anchor-read mentions of Huang leaving the DNC. Nothing on Riady
on any show.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Monday, November 18.</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times reported that Huang, who claimed he severed contact with Lippo 
when he joined Commerce, made 70 phone calls at Commerce to the Lippo Bank in
Los Angeles. The Washington Times reported that Huang lobbied to
open trade with Vietnam, a position advocated by his former
employer.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on Today or This Morning. One
mention on GMA of Huang's firing. In the evening, nothing on CBS
Evening News and NBC Nightly News. On ABC Jennings did brief item
on the 70 calls. CNN's World Today aired full story by Bob
Franken on Huang-Lippo connections. Franken even noted the money
returned from an April fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple attended
by Al Gore.

 "Close Aide to Clinton Urged Less Candor Over Indonesian" declared 
the front page New York Times headline. The Times reported that aide 
Bruce Lindsey advised describing Clinton's meetings with Indonesian billionaire 
James Riady as "social calls" though after the campaign the White House
admitted policy was discussed.
<P>
         In the morning, nothing on GMA, Today or This Morning. In
the evening, nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. The specifics weren't
spelled out on CNN's The World Today, but Wolf Blitzer did report
on a Clinton press conference in Australia that took place at
about 9pm ET:
<P>
<blockquote> 
"Sensitive questions involving a former Democratic Party
fundraiser's activities continue to chase President Clinton here
to Australia, his first overseas trip since his re-election. At a
joint news conference with Prime Minister John Howard, President
Clinton warned reporters not to rush to judgment about all of
this, including his friend and former Democratic Party fundraiser
John Huang. He compared all of this to the highly publicized case
of Richard Jewell who was wrongly accused of planting a bomb at
the Olympic games in Atlanta."
<P>         
 Clinton: "...One of the things I would urge you to do,
remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
totally baseless, I just think that we ought to make sure, we
ought to just get the facts out. And they should be reported
That's what I've encouraged everybody to do."
<P>          
Blitzer: "Mr. Clinton says he's encouraging all of his a
ides to fully cooperate and he denies that there's any official
stonewalling."
</blockquote>
<P>   
 <CENTER><H4>Wednesday, November 20</H4></CENTER>
<P>
 The above press conference is still fresh news and the DNC announces that it has 
returned $253,000 to a Thai businesswoman who had donated funds that were
really from a citizen of Thailand.
<P>          
In the morning, nothing on GMA. Both Today and This
Morning devote half of one story to Clinton's Jewell analogy.
On CBS This Morning Bill Plante reported:
<blockquote>
<P>
          "....Mr. Clinton could not avoid the controversy over
		contributions to the Democrats by wealthy Asians. Asked if his
		staff had stonewalled the issue before the election, he replied
		that he had answered all the questions asked of him and then
		compared himself with Olympic security guard Richard Jewell."
<P>
          Clinton: "One of the things I would urge you to do,
		remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering
		what has happened to so many of the accusations over the last
		four years that have bee made against me that turned out to be
		totally baseless."
<P>          
		Plante: "In fact, the question of whether those
		accusations are baseless or not is likely to shadow Mr. Clinton's
		next couple of years, but he's not likely to have to deal with
		them again on this trip because the next three days in Australia
		are mostly R&R. And tomorrow he gets the chance to do what he
		really wanted to do and that's 18 holes of golf with champion
		Greg Norman."
</blockquote>
<P>
  Of course, a CBS viewer would have no idea what he
stonewalled.
<P>
          In the evening, ABC aired nothing, NBC's Tom Brokaw
mentioned the Thai money return and CBS Evening News actually
aired a full story. Rita Braver highlighted the Jewell analogy:   
<blockquote>
<P>          
"Questions keep swirling around former Lippo Group Vice
President, John Huang. Appointed by the White House to a high
Commerce Department post then transferred to a job as a top
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. And at a news
conference, the President was asked about new allegations that
his staff deliberately delayed releasing information about
Huang's activities until after the election. A major issue, newly
disclosed White House meetings where Huang and his former Lippo
boss, James Riady discussed policy matters with Mr. Clinton. But
though some contributions Huang raised may have been illegal, Mr.
Clinton compared both Huang and himself to Richard Jewell, a man
the FBI incorrectly identified as a suspect in the Atlanta
Olympics bombing."
</blockquote>
<P>
          After a clip of Clinton claiming "I just think that we
ought to make sure we've got, you know, we ought to just get the
facts out," Braver offered a tough conclusion: "But many of those
involved in the controversy have refused to discuss their roles.
And privately, some White House aides are appalled because of the
appearance created by the unusual access of the Lippo Group." 
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Thursday, November 21.</H4></CENTER>
 Nothing on any broadcast network
show. I did not get a chance to check CNN.
<P>
    Concluding his November 18 story CNN's Bob Franklin
suggested: "John Huang may have lost his job, but neither he nor
the controversy he's the center of is about the fade away.
Congressional Republicans will see to that." 
<P>
    They will have to since the networks won't.

Jimmy Carter appeared on Today Monday (November 18) to
plug his new book, "Living Faith." Here's an exchange with Bryant
Gumbel in which Gumbel implicates prayer with Carter's poor
presidential performance:
<P> 
<blockquote> 
  Gumbel: "You write that you prayed more during your four
years in office than basically at any time in your life and yet I
think it's fair to say, and I hope this doesn't sound harsh, I
think it's fair to say, you are consistently viewed as one of the
more ineffective Presidents of modern times."
<P>    
Carter: "Well, I think that's harsh and unfair, but you have
a right to your opinion."
<P>    
Gumbel: "It's not mine. It's what I perceive as a general
view. What do you think, if anything, that says about the power
of prayer?"

Thursday night NBC Nightly News aired another segment of
its Who Cares series on charitable giving. Over video of the
Statue of Liberty, Tom Brokaw began:
<blockquote>
<P>
    "She's a symbol of hope for those seeking a better life, the
words given to us by poet Emma Lazarus. So, when the welfare
reform bill was passed by Congress this year, a bill that slashed
aid to legal immigrants, deep cuts, some $22 billion dollars
philanthropist George Soros reacted immediately, creating a $50
fund and he named it after Emma Lazarus."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw asked Soros:
<blockquote> 
<P>
"You just gave a lot of money for
immigrants because you worry immigrants, in the eyes of some
people in this country, pariahs."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw continued:
<P>
<blockquote>
 "His swift and deeply personal response to
the welfare reform bill comes at a time when many are asking
whether private giving can compensate for government cuts in
social services."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brokaw did give Arianna Huffington a chance to explain the
benefits of personal charity, but it's amazing how year after
year there are "cuts in social services" yet the budget keeps
soaring.

Boston held its Achievement in Radio Awards luncheon
Wednesday. The master of ceremonies: Charles Osgood of CBS. The
Boston Globe's Susan Bickelhaupt reported Thursday: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"As he introduced Gina (he didn't share her last name) as the one who
would hand out the awards, he took note of the catcalls and
whistles that greeted her as she took the stage in a floor-length, 
backless green gown. He then asked her to turn around, telling 
the audience, 'There are two sides to people, a front and
a back.'"
</blockquote>
<P>
    As the Boston Herald's Inside Track column observed about
Osgood making "the shapely award presenter...model her
attributes" for the crowd, "If the PC Police were there, he would
have been 'cuffed and hauled away!"

 Thursday the MRC's Free Market Project released a joint
study conducted with a group called Consumer Alert. The study
examined 13 magazines: Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle,
Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Mademoiselle,
McCall's, Parents, Prevention, Redbook, Weight Watchers, Women's
Day, and Working Woman.
<P>
    Following is the front page summary of the 12 page study. The
entire report will soon be on our <A HREF="http://www.mediaresearch.org/">web site</A>
, but for more information, to arrange an interview or to get a copy, e-mail

<P>
High-circulation women's and family magazines use most of their
ink to focus on lifestyle issues -- relationships between dating
and married couples, parenting, home decorating, fashions and
personal care, and dieting. Surprisingly, many also deal with
public policy issues relating to government activism and women's
and families' health and safety.
<P>
A joint Consumer Alert/Media Research Center study of 13 women's
and family magazines analyzed the October 1995 through September
1996 issues for their policy-oriented coverage. Part I of the
study reviewed whether expansion of government programs was
depicted positively or negatively. Part II looked at the
magazines' depiction of risk in discussing public policy issues
relating to health and safety. The study found:
<P>
<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI> In the 13 magazines studied, there were 115 positive
portrayals of government activism and/or calls for more. There
were only 18 negative portrayals and/or calls for less.
<LI> Twenty-three stories went beyond promoting bigger government
they also asked readers to lobby government officials on behalf
of expanded government programs.
<LI> In 56 articles or mentions of science and risk issues, 35 were
one-sided and did not acknowledge a skeptical view that the risks
depicted were minor and the alarmist views presented go against
mainstream science.
<LI> According to women's magazines, recycling is always good. Out
of 15 stories that mentioned recycling, there was not one
skeptical argument presented that sometimes recycling is
impractical and wastes resources.
<LI> Women's magazines featured numerous warnings about unsafe
drinking water, yet routinely bashed chlorine as unsafe, even
though chlorine provides the most effective protection against
waterborne diseases.
</UL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Recommendations:</B>
<P>
<BR> 
Look for balance in coverage of public policy
issues. Note who the spokespersons are for a particular point of
view. Is there a pattern in who is depicted as the good guys (or
gals) and bad guys? Be skeptical of articles that provide only
anecdotal information instead of scientific evidence.

<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Reporting the death of Alger Hiss, in the November 16
Washington Times, reporter Carelton Bryant noted that "Hiss's
supporters and detractors often have camped on opposite sides of
the political spectrum. Liberals, such as Adlai Stevenson and
John Foster Dulles, defended Hiss, saying charges against him
were the product of a communist witch hunt. Conservatives, such
as William F. Buckley and J. Edgar Hoover, castigated Hiss,
saying he was one of many left-leaning intellectuals swayed by
the communists' economic rhetoric during the Great Depression."
<P>
    Guess which point of view the networks took Friday night?
<P>
    On the November 15 <I>World News Tonight</I> Peter Jennings
announced:
<P>
<blockquote> 
    "We learned late today that a very controversial American had
died. Alger Hiss was an accomplished lawyer and a diplomat until
a man named Whittaker Chambers accused him a being a communist
who passed state secrets to the Soviets. At congressional
hearings Hiss defended himself against a young Richard Nixon.
Hiss was ultimately convicted of perjury. He lost his livelihood
and his marriage. He protested his innocence until the very end
and last year we reported that the Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said that KGB files had supported Mr. Hiss's claim. He
was 92 when he died today."
<P>
</blockquote>
    On CNN's <I>Prime News</I> anchor Linden Soles told viewers: 
<P>   
<blockquote>
 "Alger Hiss, the man at the center of a Cold War spy scandal,
has died at age 92. Hiss was a Harvard educated lawyer with a
distinguished career in government when he was accused in 1948 of
helping pass secret documents to the Soviets. The case attracted
national attention and helped spurn a period of blacklisting and
hysteria over the communist threat. Richard Nixon's political
career got a major boost after his aggressive efforts in Congress
against Hiss. Hiss was later convicted of perjury and spent the
rest of his life trying to clear his name."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Tom Brokaw, on NBC <I>Nightly News</I>, declared: 
<P>
<blockquote>   
 "One of the most controversial men of the post-war years has
died. Alger Hiss, at the age of 92. He was a public servant of
rising prominence in the 1930s and 1940s when suddenly he was
caught up in a spy scandal and he was accused of being a member
of the Communist Party. In 1948 he was charged with helping pass
State Department secrets to the Soviets. His case drew
unprecedented attention and he was pursued tenaciously by a
freshman Congressman -- Richard Nixon. Despite the support of
many prominent Americans, Hiss was sent to prison for almost four
years. It's a case that still divides many people in this
country, but at the end of his life Hiss considered vindication a
declaration by a Russian General, who controlled the KGB
archives, saying that Hiss had never been a spy. Alger Hiss, dead
tonight at the age of 92."
</blockquote>
<P>    
As for the vindication suggested by Jennings and Brokaw, both
were apparently referring to a 1992 statement from Soviet General
Volkogonov that the KGB archives contained no evidence that Hiss
had spied for the Soviet Union. But as even The New York Times
obituary on Saturday noted, "he conceded that he could not rule
out the possibility that some records have been overlooked or
destroyed."
<P>
    The New York Times story continued: "In 1993, Maria Schmidt,
a Hungarian historian doing research on the Hungarian secret
police, said she had discovered a stack of documents among the
files of the Interior Ministry in Budapest that implicated Mr.
Hiss as a communist spy."
<P>
    Finally, earlier this year the National Security Agency
released a 1945 message to Moscow from a Soviet spy in Washington
that identified a State Department official as an agent code-named 
"Ales." As the Times reported, "There was a notation by
someone at the National Security Agency suggesting Ales was
'probably Alger Hiss.'"

<FONT SIZE=+2>2)  </FONT> The November 13 CyberAlert reported that ABC's <I>World
News Tonight</I> on Tuesday, November 12 aired a story on the
Commerce Department launching an investigation of whether John
Huang raised money for the DNC while he was at Commerce and
whether he really cut off all contact with the Lippo Indonesian
conglomerate where he formerly worked.
<P>
    NBC <I>Nightly News</I> and CBS <I>Evening News</I> that night: No story. 
And the blackout has continued, a review of broadcast network
evening shows through November 16 found:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>    The November 13 Washington Post reported the Commerce
Department investigation and that DNC Chairman Don Fowler
conceded the party failed the check the legitimacy of donors. The
Washington Times reported on page one that Huang met with Webster
Hubbell after Hubbell resigned but before he plead guilty: "At
the time of the meeting, Mr. Huang had been at the Commerce
Department for 15 days after his resignation as vice chairman of
the Indonesian-based Lippo Group. Hubbell was on the Lippo
payroll after his 1994 resignation and was negotiating with
independent counsel Kenneth Starr for testimony in the Whitewater
probe." 
</UL>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The November 14 Washington Post picked up the Washington
Times story on the Huang/Hubbell meeting and detailed how Huang
simultaneously worked at Commerce and raised DNC money.
</ul>
<P>
        Network stories: None.
<P>
    <ul>
<LI>A front page story in the November 15 Los Angeles Times
recounted how large donations to the DNC followed a few days after
businessmen met Huang at Commerce. Also on Friday, The Wall
Street Journal revealed that Mark Middleton, the White House aide
involved in fundraising in Taiwan with Huang, "entertained
clients or potential clients in the White House staff restaurant
after he left the government and set up his own consulting
company."
 </UL>
<P>
       Network stories: None
<P>
<UL>
    <LI> The Saturday, November 16 New York Times reported that in
an interview with the paper Clinton admitted "that he twice
discussed policy about Indonesia and China with James Riady, the
Indonesian financier, Democratic contributor and longtime friend
of Mr. Clinton who is at the center of several inquiries into the
influence of foreign money in Washington."

 On Friday The Washington Post's John Carmody reported:
"Senior presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos lunched in
Manhattan yesterday with ABC News President Roone Arledge and his
top aide, Joanna Bistany. Network sources say Stephanopoulos, who
has said he plans to leave the White House soon, is being
considered as a contributor to Sunday morning's This Week as the
program undergoes changes following David Brinkley's retirement
as moderator, and on other news programs, including Good Morning
America."

Zelnick had begun his story by himself falsely characterizing the

<blockquote>
    -- "George, did the media last night and today make too much
of this magic 50 percent margin for the President, or was it
internally a big deal?"
<P>
    -- "George, recently in a New Yorker profile that I think
most would argue was very favorable about you, not only did you
mention potential plans to leave, you said, I'm paraphrasing, 'it
was time to grow up,' leading some of your detractors to say 
'what in goodness name was the senior counselor to the President
doing having not grown up, but being senior counselor to the
President.' If you can dispassionately critique your own
performance over the past four years, I'd like you to do so."
<P>
    -- "It was said of the welfare bill when it came up from the
Hill at the time that the choice for the White House was, and
this was a cynical view, either veto it as extreme or sign it and
fix it. Can you fix it?"

  <FONT SIZE=+2> 4)</FONT> Yesterday's CyberAlert reported that a November 10
Washington Post editorial incorrectly argued that many NRA-backed 
candidates, such as Colorado's Wayne Allard, lost. Tuesday's Post 
ran this correction: "In the Colorado election to replace retiring Sen.
Hank Brown, Rep. Wayne Allard was the winner last Tuesday. In an
editorial Sunday we listed him incorrectly as having lost."
<P>
    A nice start, but as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham
pointed out to me the Post had also listed "Vince Snowbarger,
Kansas," as "among the other NRA favorites who lost." In fact,
Snowbarger won his House seat race 50 percent to 45 percent for
his Democratic opponent.
<P>
    Maybe next time the Post should fact-check the Handgun 
Control Inc. press release before running it as an editorial.

<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5)</FONT> Appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman Monday
night ABC Prime Time Live co-host Diane Sawyer recounted an
experience on a recent plane flight:
<P>
<blockquote>
    Diane Sawyer: "The other day, this is your worst nightmare.
It happened to me on the plane. I am sitting there, and I'd been
traveling and traveling and I'm in who knows what time zone,
there is no time zone for which I am in. And sitting next to me
is this woman who has this sumptuous bosom, there's just no other
way to put it. And something must have sublimely set in,
grandmother reveries, or something like that, and the next thing
you know thirty minutes later I wake up and my nose is right in
the cleavage. We are not talking just leaning against, I'm just
buried in there, my little nose. It's true, it's a true story.
And one eye opened and you think 'where am I?' And then the other
eye opens and you look up and there she is, and she's absolutely
benign, like God sent me a pillow. It was beautiful, it was
beautiful."
<P>
    David Letterman: "Had there been complimentary wine on the
flight? Was there a delay and everybody got an extra cocktail, is
that what happened?"
<P>
    Sawyer: "It was just temptation, like you and Morley Safer,
you know how it is."
<P>

    It would be impossible to make this stuff up.

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> Past CyberAlerts have quoted examples of reporters
tagging Dole, Gingrich and conservatives as "harsh" and examples
of reporters stating as fact that it was the Republicans who
shut down the government, as if President Clinton had nothing to
do with it. Well, MRC analyst Steve Kaminski alerted me to a
media bias combo quote in which CBS reporter Bob Schieffer did
both. On the November 3 Sunday Morning Schieffer asserted: 
 <P>
<blockquote>   "Newt Gingrich has become sort of a logo for harsh
Republican rhetoric. I don't think there's anybody who would
tell you today that the Republicans maybe did not go a little
too far in the harshness of their rhetoric. They really
irritated a lot of people, poll after poll shows it, local
officials will tell you that, when they shut down the
government. They got the blame for that and I think in some 
ways it really kind of frightened people."

<P>
<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> UPN's "Star Trek: Voyager" episode last Wednesday,
November 6, revolved around the crew of the Voyager, which is
from the 24th Century, traveling back in time to 1996 Los
Angeles in order to avert the destruction of the Earth in the
29th Century. The cause of the future disaster: a Mr. Henry
Starling, played by Ed Begley Jr., who heads a computer company
ominously named ChronowerX.
<P>
    Because of a time-travel mess up Starling has obtained
technological know-how from a 29th Century spaceship. The
Voyager crew learns he's an evil businessman who became rich and
powerful by using this knowledge to create a new computer chip
in 1969 and dominate the new industry. They conclude the
"computer age of late 20th century shouldn't have happened." 
In order to keep the Voyager crew's arrival secret, businessman
Starling dispatches one of his goons to murder the astronomer
who alerted him to their arrival. 
   <P>
 Anyway, at one point the camera pans his office and full
screen for a couple of seconds is a picture on a table: a framed
photo of "Starling" shaking hands with President Richard Nixon.

<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> The November 10 Washington Post ran an editorial titled
"Slim Sales at the Polls for the NRA." A reliable source, a
CyberAlert recipient, urged me to check the editorial's content.
It reads in part: "Though the big campaign contributions from
the NRA flowed as usual this year, they didn't pay off the way
they once did. Some of the strongest opponents of responsible
handgun and assault weapon controls were among the losers."
Conveniently, the Post supplied a list of these losers: "Among
the NRA favorites who lost....In Senate races, Wayne Allard in
Colorado..."
<P>
    Wayne Allard, known to those outside the Post as Senator-elect 
Allard, captured 51 percent of the vote versus 46 percent for his 
Democratic opponent.            
<P>
<BR>
<a name="4">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> While we're on the Post, the November 11 Weekly
Standard observed: "The Washington Post has editorialized
against color-blind public policies, but it has embraced
colorblindness in an area where color presumably does matter --
in describing the appearance of individuals....we read in
October 26's Post of an abduction from a garage at Tysons II
Galleria mall near Washington: 'Police describe the suspect as
muscular, about 6 feet 1 inch tall and about 190 pounds, with
short dark hair and dark eyes.'...
<P>
    "In fact, the police described the suspect as muscular and
dark-skinned...so at least the warning posters at the mall said
the next day. But the police description was too politically
incorrect to be reproduced by the Post, which is evidently more
afraid of getting angry calls from black 'community leaders'
than it is interested in helping apprehend a rapist.'"
<P>    
Indeed, that's not an isolated example. The November 9 Post
carried an account of a street robbery in D.C. suffered by
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Here's the complete
description of the purse-snatcher as provided by the Post: "The
thief was a man of undetermined age who wore a white satin
jacket, police said."

<BR>
  <FONT SIZE=+2> 5)</FONT> Here are some poll numbers I never found the space to
run before the election. So, before they become antique:
<blockquote>
<P>
    -- A September poll of 1,000 registered voters for the
Freedom Forum (conducted by the Roper Center), found that most
who believe the media are biased think the media are biased to
the left: "Nearly one-third (31%) say coverage favors the
Democratic party, while 9% say coverage favors the GOP. More
than half (53%) regard coverage as balanced."
<P>
    -- Recall how the networks ignored many Clinton scandal
stories that newspapers covered? The same Freedom Forum/Roper
poll showed why that's relevant: "More than half of all voters
(56 percent) said they get most of their information about the
presidential campaign from television. An additional 30 percent
get most of their information from newspapers (17 percent),
radio (11 percent), or magazines (2 percent)." 
<P>
   -- A Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll
released October 25 found: "A huge majority of voters (67%)
believe that among four leadership groups in the country, the
news media exerts too much influence on which candidate becomes
President, followed by business corporations (59%), labor unions
(45%) and the churches (15%)."

<FONT SIZE=+2>1)  </FONT> On Friday's PBS Washington Week in Review NBC News
reporter Gwen Ifill offered her view on what the Republican
congressional leaders and Clinton will do next year: 
<P>
<blockquote>   "I don't see any of them talking about entitlement reform in
any real way other than to brand the other guy someone who's
interested in cutting your own mother off."
<P>
    Entitlement reform, as in Medicare? Where has Ifill been?
Isn't that an issue the Republican Congress tried to "reform" in

<FONT SIZE=+2> 2)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught the loaded spin from
Time magazine on how Republican House members fared in Tuesday's
election. Writing the cover story for the November 18 issue that
was released last week, Michael Duffy and Nancy Gibbs asserted:
<P>
<blockquote>
    "Nearly half the casualties came from Gingrich's militant
class of 1994, who had pushed the Speaker hardest to the right
and demanded the deepest cuts in popular domestic programs in
their zeal for a balanced budget. Gone are at least six of 71
GOP freshmen, including Dan Frisa of New York, who was defeated
by Carolyn McCarthy, the widow of a victim of the Long Island
Rail Road shooting, who ran on a single-issue platform: gun
control."
</blockquote>
<P>
    I think 17 House Republicans lost by the latest count, so
really only about a third were freshmen. But let's do a little
math based upon Time's numbers. Six of 71 lost. That's 8.5
percent, meaning 91.5 percent of the House freshmen won. Quite a
repudiation of those "extremists." 
<P>
    Also among the Republicans who lost on Tuesday: Peter Blute
and Peter Torkildsen, two moderates who abandoned Gingrich on
some key votes and were gun control advocates.

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>3) </FONT> As mentioned in the last CyberAlert, on Thursday's
Larry King Live King said David Brinkley's election night
remarks reminded him of "wacko talk radio." Here's the complete
transcript of that November 7 exchange with guest Ted Koppel.
(Diane Rehmm is host of a 10am to noon talk show on a Washington
public radio station and her show is heard on NPR stations
around the country.)
<P>
<blockquote>
    Larry King: "How about the part where he said 'he's a bore,
always will be a bore.'? That sounds, someone called Diane
Rehm's radio show the other day, and this was the first I'd
heard of it, and I was driving along."
<P>  
 Ted Koppel: "I was listening to the same show, heard the same
call."
<P>
    King: "And it was a lady."
<P>
    Koppel: "Very nice lady."
<P>
    King: "And she was disappointed, very nice lady, a fan of
David Brinkley. She was very disappointed. And when I heard the
quote it sounded to me like it was Limbaugh or Liddy or Ollie
North. It was like wacko talk radio. It didn't sound like
Brinkley. In other words, Brinkley's always been irreverent, but
always kind of classy."
<P>
    Interesting to learn that while both King and Koppel listen
to a talk show, it's a public radio talk show.
<P>
    On Friday David Brinkley taped an interview with Bill
Clinton for airing on Sunday's This Week, his last show as host.
Brinkley, who had called Clinton "a bore" and said his election
night speech was full of "goddamn nonsense," began the
interview: "Before we begin I am reminded of something I wrote
years ago. 'It may be impossible to be objective,' I said. 'But
we must always be fair.' Well after a long day election day, and
seven hours on the set, what I said at the end of our election
night coverage was both impolite and unfair. And I'm sorry. I
regret it."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Brinkley had the class to apologize for interjecting his
opinion into a newscast. I await Bryant Gumbels's apology for 
insults against Republicans over the years.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="3">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> Reminding one of Nixonian thinking, last week Bill
Clinton promised to "cut out of American politics" his enemies. The
comment has hardly generated any media outrage. I've only seen
it on one TV show: CNN's Late Edition, and then only thanks to Bill
Bennett. On Sunday, November 10 host Frank Sesno raised it
during an interview with Bennett and Mario Cuomo:
   <blockquote>
<P>
 Frank Sesno to Mario Cuomo: "Mario Cuomo I need to ask you
about this, because amid all this hugging and this 'vital
center' and this other nonsense that we hear about that will
soon fade away as we actually get down to the reality, there is
this item that Bill Bennett actually caught in USA Today a
couple of days back that's a pick up from the Associated
Press quoting Bill Clinton as telling political supporters in
Arkansas that he 'will devote a lot of time,' I am quoting from
the paper here, 'going after detractors who pursued him on
Whitewater and other ethical questions.' He called political
attackers, quote, 'a cancer,' and vowed, quote 'to cut them out
of American politics.'"
<P>
    Cuomo: "Excuse me, that was President Clinton?"
<P>    
Sesno: "Yes. That is remarkable stuff. What do you make of
that?"
<P>
</blockquote>
    As Bennett observed, if the President were Republican such a
remark would cause "a firestorm" in the media.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="5">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>5) </FONT> Speaking of what Sesno termed "nonsense," on the Don
Imus radio show on Thursday, November 7, NBC anchor Tom Brokaw
urged the Congress to forget doing anything conservative and
avoid investigations. Here are some of Brokaw's comments, as
transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: 
<blockquote>
    Though voters kept the Congress in Republican hands Brokaw
saw no endorsement of the 1994 switch: 
    "I don't think it is a status quo election. I think there is
a kind of command, if you will, from the public to move to the
sensible center and let's get some things done....I don't think
that you can say that there's any ideological revolution as the
Republicans claimed two years ago nor do I think this President
can now say that he has this overwhelming mandate. I think what
people have cried out for is some return to common sense in
American politics. And I think that you see that reflected
already in Alfonse D'Amato, his evil twin, Skippy, apparently
has vacated his body and now he says we no longer need these
investigations of Bill and Hillary. I mean it's really one of
the remarkable turnarounds in contemporary politics."
   <P>
 Imus: "Isn't that really from Senator D'Amato covering his
own situation because he's got to run for reelection here in '98
and a lot of these exit polls here in New York suggest that
people well, hate him.
<P>
    Brokaw: "....I think that's what people want. I think that
they want politicians in Washington to solve the real problems
that are going on and when they make an assignment to a special
prosecutor or to the Justice Department, let them do that kind
of investigation....
   <P>
 "And you must remember, a lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential
aspirations four years from now. They'll want to get things done
because I think that's the underlying message from the country
here - solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems
within the administration that need to be investigated, but
there are agencies and ways of doing that without tying up
Congress in these expensive hearings."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<hr width=33% align=left>
<P>
<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>6) </FONT> Finally, on the humorous front, here's a bit of what
Senator John Kerry told Katie Couric on Today Wednesday morning
after his re-election over Bill Weld: 
<blockquote>
   "The fact is that out of the last five Governors of
Massachusetts, four of them have been Republicans. People forget
that about Massachusetts. We are a reflection of the rest of the
country. We're fairly conservative, people want the same things
people want in the rest of the country."
<P>
</blockquote>
    Massachusetts conservative? Reflection of the country? This
the morning after Bob Dole got just 28 percent in the state. He
did worse only in Rhode Island. And, the day after the state's
two GOP House members were turned out. 
<P>
    As for Republican Governors, current Governor Weld is a 
Republican. Before him Democrat Michael Dukakis held the office 
for eight years and he succeeded Ed King, another Democrat who 
beat Dukakis in the 1978 primary. That means two of the last three 
have been Democrats.

1) A front page story in the November 7 Los Angeles Times
reported: "The Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that
it is returning one of its largest 1996 campaign contributions,
$325,000, to Yogesh K. Gandhi because it could not verify that he
was the source of the funds." On Thursday the DNC returned a
$50,000 donation to a Greek businessman. 
<BR><DD>
So how did the networks play this confirmation of the pre-election 
GOP charge that the DNC took money from foreign nationals, which 
is illegal? Not a word on the November 7 CBS Evening News or NBC 
Nightly News. Only ABC's World News Tonight covered it. Reporter 
Jackie Judd put the news at the top of her piece on Republican 
plans to investigate Clinton.
<P>
But Thursday's NBC Nightly News found time to report
D'Amato's announcement and to disparage the quest for information.
Jim Miklaszewski's story started with the news of cabinet
resignations, then moved to D'Amato. Here's the end of his
report: 
<BR><DD>
    Jim Miklaszewski: "One of the Clinton's chief antagonists in
Congress, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, announced his Whitewater probe
is over"
<br><dd>
    D'Amato: "I think if we get into this business of looking
like we're out to fish, to bring up something to embarrass the
President. I don't think that's good for the country."
<br><dd>
    Miklaszewski: "White House officials are under no illusions
and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue investigations
on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's
announcement may signal an end to any high profile political
witch hunts. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the White House."
<p>
When the Senate held four weeks of hearings chaired by
D'Amato in July and August 1995 NBC Nightly News ran a grand
total three stories.

2) Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas has
discovered that Paula Jones may have some credibility. On the
November 3 Inside Washington the panel discussed the new American
Lawyer article in which reporter Stuart Taylor learned that "a
comparison of the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests
that the evidence against the President is far stronger than the
media has let on -- and far stronger than the evidence against
[Clarence] Thomas."
<BR><DD>
On the show Evan Thomas explained: "There are two witnesses
here that matter, there are two friends of Paula Jones that she
spoke to right after the alleged incident. And they do not
generally make their story available to the press, generally.
They talked to one reporter from the [Washington] Post, Mike
Isikoff, and the Post worried about whether to do this story for
a long time, finally ran a kind of somewhat diluted version of
it, and nobody talked to these women. Now, Stuart has gone back
and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale."
<BR><DD>
Nina Totenberg, who first publicized Hill's unsubstantiated
an uncorroborated charges, then asserted: "There are two things
in this article: one is the examination of the evidence which is
fair game and not dramatically new but very interesting and
somewhat compelling. The other is the Anita Hill argument and I
would say that's apples and oranges. This woman is going to get
her day in court or she's going to settle, one or the other."
<P>
When the Jones story first came to light Evan took a bit
different approach. On the May 7, 1994 Inside Washington he
declared:
<br><dd>
"Yes, the case is being fomented by right-wing nuts, and yes,
she is not a very credible witness, and it's really not a law
case at all...some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the
trailer parks...I think she's a dubious witness, I really do."
<P>
The American Lawyer article has been out for two weeks. So
what has Evan Thomas put in Newsweek. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski
reports nothing appeared in this week's or last week's issue.

3) Yesterday's CyberAlert reported how at the end of ABC's
election night broadcast David Brinkley noted the creativity of
his ABC colleagues, and then charged that "Bill Clinton has none
of it. He has not a creative bone in his body. Therefore he is a
bore and will always be a bore." I also predicted that his
remarks would become big news as the journalistic community
cringed at the anti-Clinton remarks. 
<P>
Well, Thursday's newspapers brought plenty of stories and a
remark earlier election night that didn't air on ABC's Washington
affiliate. Just after Clinton finished his speech, at about
12:30am ET, this exchange occurred, as printed in the November 7
Dallas Morning News. (Rush Limbaugh on Thursday also played a tape
of Brinkley's comments.)
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "I wish to say that we all look forward with great
pleasure to four years of wonderful, inspiring speeches full of
wit, poetry, music, love and affection. More goddamn nonsense."
<br><dd>
Peter Jennings: "You can't say that on the air, Mr. Brinkley."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Well, I'm not on the air."
<br><dd>
Jennings: "David, we are on the air."
<br><dd>
Brinkley: "Too bad. I told you I was leaving."
<P>
<DD>Thursday night the controversy led Larry King's CNN interview
with Ted Koppel. King called the remarks "mean-spirited," and
something he'd expect from "wacko talk radio" hosts like
Limbaugh, Oliver North or G. Gordon Liddy. [There will be more of
King's comments in the next CyberAlert.]
<br><dd>
All fall reporters regularly referred to Bob Dole as "harsh,"
but no controversy erupted. Back on the February 20 Today show
Bryant Gumbel derided Pat Buchanan as "Mr. Puke-anan." 
<br><dd>
I'm still waiting for the media consternation.

4) Here are some more quotes from election night coverage on
NBC and CBS, as collated by Steve Kaminski, Geoffrey Dickens and
Joe Alfonsi.
<ul>
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "How concerned is the President about the potential of his being, sort of, tied down as Gulliver was by the Lilliputians, by all this scandal investigation, ethics investigations that are bound to be unleashed?"
<li><i>Dan Rather to Senator Trent Lott:</i> "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the White House with so-called ethics inquiries?"
<li><i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "At one point Trent Lott was talking about unleashing some investigations of fundraising and other matters at the White House. Do you think he will pull back from that once reality sets in come January?"
<li><i>Dan Rather:</i> "The Colorado Senate race has been decided. Our CBS News estimate is the seat will remain Republican with Wayne Allard finishing with roughly 51 percent and Tom Strickland somewhat below that. The Democrats thought that Wayne Allard perhaps was, 'too far right' to succeed the retiring Republican, Senator Hank Brown. Turned out to be not the case, Allard wins it for the Republicans in Colorado."
<li><i>Up next, Rather labeled a Democrat, but not as "too far left." He used a milder tag for a Minnesota Senator:</i> "No surprises here, although Paul Wellstone, the Republicans had targeted him. They thought they had him. Frequently called the most liberal member of the United States Senate, but Wellstone has returned for a second term in Minnesota."
</ul>
<P>
Brinkley may have dumped on Clinton, but here's what NBC
viewers got after Clinton's speech:
<ul>
<li><dd><i>Maria Shriver:</i> "Tom, very emotional ending to his speech. Expressed a lot of gratitude. He said he was humbled by this victory. And I don't know if you could tell, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be brushing away some tears. A lot of hugging up on that stage. A lot of tears in this audience. A tremendous amount of emotion here this evening. A lot of young people with smiles on their face but holding each other. Certainly a night that I don't think anybody here will ever forget." <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "We're watching the two couples on stage now.  They are the icons of the baby boomer generation!" <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "That's true!"  <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton. They're handsome families." <br><dd>    <i>Maria Shriver:</i> "They're picture perfect!" <br><dd>    <i>Tom Brokaw:</i> "Right!" 
<li><i>Brokaw after 1am ET:</i> "That's 30 Rockefeller Plaza overlooking the ice-skating rink and if Bill Clinton were here tonight he'd be down there skating to his heart's delight obviously because he's been re-elected President of the United States." 
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "We're back. Thirty Rockefeller Plaza there. I half expect to see Jimmy Cagney singing 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' and dancing between those flags."
<li><i>Brokaw:</i> "Brian Williams, I have a question. You've been covering the Clinton White House for some time. Do you think that there is any more heroic figure, however not very visible, than Bob Rubin, who is the Treasury Secretary?"
</ul>

5) On Wednesday night's Late Show with David Letterman
actress Marisa Tomei appeared. Here's part of the interview:
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Did you vote yesterday?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Are you happy with the outcome?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I'm very happy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Have you ever met President Clinton?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yes I have."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Where'd you meet him? At the White House?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Yeah. I met him at the White House."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "What was that like?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "It was very sexy, actually. It is that whole feeling."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "Sexy in what sense? You're not talking about the President?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Well, it's a round room, first of all, the Oval Office."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He's an enormous guy, isn't he?"
<br><dd>
Tomei: [taken aback, assuming a reference to Clinton's penis size]
"I don't know. [pause] I'm sure. It's why I voted for him."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "I mean he's fat, is what I was driving at."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "Oooh."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "I don't think so."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "He is fat and I'm going to continue to say so."
<br><dd>
Tomei: "No, he's healthy. He's healthy."
<br><dd>
Letterman: "No, they say, you know they released his medical
records like about a month ago to show that he was okay, he can 
run for another four years. And I'm telling you they fudged,
because they said he's 215 [Letterman laughs]. Two-fifteen is
when lunch ends for this guy."
<p>
The gender gap solved. All Bob Dole had to do was meet women in a "round room."

"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession." -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30

Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." -- <i>World News Tonight</i>, October 27, 1992.
<P>
"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." -- Dan Rather,

"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." -- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS <i>Evening News</i>. The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." -- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC <i>Nightly News.</i>

of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." -- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.
<P>
"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If

<FONT SIZE=+2> 1)</FONT> If you say something less than glowing about President
Clinton, then you are "harsh." On Monday (November 4) night's
World News Tonight, ABC anchor Peter Jennings told viewers:
<blockquote>    "Some of the harshest language about the President, again
today coming from Ross Perot. Mr. Perot made only one public
appearance today, in his home state of Texas."
</blockquote>
<P>
    And here's Perot's harsh comment: "Would you allow a man with
pending criminal charges to babysit your children? It's a joke.
You wouldn't think about it."

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2) </FONT> In a short World News Tonight segment Monday night Sam Donaldson explained some of the changes in committee
chairmanships that would happen if Democrats take control of the
upper chamber. But only one Senator got an extremist tag:
<blockquote>    "At the Armed Services Committee, you'll find Carl Levin, far
less user friendly to the armed services, would be the chairman.
In Foreign Relations, Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative would no
longer be there. And in Labor and Foreign Relations, Ted Kennedy
would chair once again. If the President wants to try for health
care reform once more, he'd have a friendly committee there."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Yes, he said "Labor and Foreign Relations" when he meant
Labor and Human Resources.

<BR>
     <FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught CBS reporter Bill
Plante adopting liberal spin as fact on Monday's This Morning.
Looking back at the 1996 campaign, Plante asserted at one point: 
   <blockquote> "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made
for TV convention? No way. It really began with this year's State
of the Union address. The President already knew he'd have no
opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled
badly by shutting down the government."

    <FONT SIZE=+2>4) </FONT> On Saturday's Capital Gang on CNN both Margaret Carlson of Time and Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal put their liberal
hearts ahead of their political brains. 
<P>
   Margaret Carlson offered this prediction on the House races,
as transcribed by MRC intern Joe Alfonsi: "Some of the Democrats
are going to suffer from the down draft from Clinton and the
money. Some of these freshman are going to go and that's great
relief. Helen Chenoweth, her evil twin, Andrea Seastrand in
California, J.D. Hayworth, Steve Stockman, the painter from
Texas." 
<P>
   National Review's Kate O'Beirne jumped in: "More women in
Congress Margaret, what's wrong with you?" Carlson countered:
"You have to reach a certain level of competence."
<P>
    O'Beirne then predicted the GOP would hold the House. Al Hunt
agreed, but: "All the reporting that I've done, suggests that
Kate is absolutely right and I think over 90 percent of the
incumbents are going to be re-elected because it's a good year
for incumbents. But my gut tells me that two dozen of those
Gingrich robots, the freshmen, are going to bite the dust and the
Democrats are going to pick up 25 seats. Mark I'm not sure I
believe it, but it's my prediction and I'm sticking with it."
<P>
    We'll soon know if Hunt's dream of a Democratic House will
come true.

<BR>
   <FONT SIZE=+2>  5) </FONT>Why are Generation Xers (those in their 20s) turned off
by Campaign '96? Here's the explanation of Tabitha Soren from MTV
as espoused on Monday's This Morning: 
   <blockquote> "This year you have two known quantities so young people feel
like they are dealing with people who are political insiders and
that generally turns younger people off. They really feel, our
polls show, that they are disinterested and even the people who
are voting are not really happy with their choices. They feel
like they're sort of choosing between which Menendez brother do
they like better. So, a lot of them also say they'd love to turn
to a third party if they thought they could win. But I think
that's keeping a lot of people away from the process."
</blockquote>
<P>
<BR>
    Between watching all the election night coverage and going to
an election night party, I probably won't have time to do a
CyberAlert for Wednesday morning, so expect the next CyberAlert
Wednesday night/Thursday morning.

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>NPR's Mara Liasson predicts that <a href="#second">in a second term Bill Clinton will propose many new government programs,</a> but that doesn't make him a liberal.
<li><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> says Republicans shut the government down and asserts: "I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide in 1994."
<li>Among the DNC donors listed in the report the Democrats initially refused to release: <a href="#celebs">Hollywood celebrities from Robert Zemeckis to Danny DeVito.</a>
<li>A TV <a href="#host">network host admits supporting George McGovern</a> -- when she was seven years old.
</ol>
<a name="second">
1) A lot of little government programs add up to big government
and putting mandates on business is the latest way liberals have found
to impose their views, but that's escaped NPR's Mara Liasson. On
Washington Week in Review Friday night on PBS (November 1) Liasson
assured viewers that Republican are wrong to tag Clinton a liberal:
<br><dd>
"There's this myth that if Clinton does get the Democrats back in
control [of Congress], he'll revert to the quote 'old Bill Clinton.' The 
Republicans would like you to believe he'll become a liberal again. 
I don't think that's going to happen. I think the White House has 
prepared a second term agenda that is geared with either a razor-thin 
Democratic majority in mind, or Republicans still in control. They are 
going to be able to get the same program through no matter what. And 
it's going to be these small, incremental things, teeny tiny proposals 
that he's made this year, nothing big, no big government programs."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
2) Republicans and conservatives may gain House and Senate seats 
on Tuesday and Bill Clinton is winning by stealing conservative issues
and claiming credit for the accomplishments of Congress, but Sam Donaldson
doesn't think the country has moved right.
<P>
In the roundtable portion of Sunday's This Week with David Brinkley
Sam Donaldson went so far from reality that even Cokie Roberts felt 
compelled to correct him:
<br><dd>
    Sam Donaldson: "George is always seeing a conservative tide. If 
three county commissioners are elected in an off season and they 
happen to be Republican conservative, you say there's a Republican 
conservative tide. I don't think this was a Republican conservative tide 
in 1994."
<br><dd>
Cokie Roberts: "How come only Democratic incumbents lost and no 
Republican incumbents lost?"
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "Because I think it was the voters saying throw the 
bums out."
<br><dd>
Roberts: "But no Republican incumbents lost."
<br><dd>
Donaldson: "But I'm taking about conservative tide. There was an 
anti-Democratic tide, absolutely, Cokie. They said throw these Democrtaic 
bums out they've had all these years in Congress and we don't like it 
and we don't like our lives and they're in."
<br><dd>George Will: "Speaking for conservatives, let's just say 1994 is 
alright with us no matter what you call it."
<br><dd>Donaldson: "Are you going to shut down the government again, did 
that strategy work?"
<P>
<a name="celebs">
3) At a campaign rally in New Jersey on Sunday, actress
Whoopi Goldberg introduced the President. While she's on the
road for the campaign, her friends in Hollywood have been writing
some large checks. When the Democratic National Committee last 
week released a donor list they initially withheld, the Washington
Times checked to see who was among those making the $10.1 million
in donations that arrived in early October. Among the names:
<ul>
<li>TV producer Norman Lear: $80,000
<li>Movie director Robert Zemeckis: $50,000
<li>Actor Robin Williams and wife Marsha: $30,000
<li>Eagles singer Don Henley: $30,000
<li>Actor Danny DeVito: $5,000
<li>Movie Director Rob Reiner: $5,000
<li>Former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis: $5,000
</ul>
Meanwhile, the October 31 Washington Post had this item
in a "day in the life" story on the campaigns:
<br><dd>
"3pm, Washington. Kevin Spacey, the movie actor is touring the
Clinton-Gore headquarters....The entire Clinton-Gore Washington
operation screeches to a halt. Eventually they get Spacey to
participate in a daily campaign ritual. The staffers have taped
a sheet a butcher paper to a door. On the paper, in crayon, somebody
has drawn the White House and the number seven -- as in seven
more days and it's over. As the Olympic fanfare blares from a
boombox, and the staffers cheer him on, Spacey jumps through the
paper like Superman."
<P>
<a name="host">
4) Opening the Saturday Today show on November 2, co-host
Jodi Applegate promoted an upcoming segment. In so doing she
showed that members of the media don't grow liberal with age, 
they start out that way.
<BR><DD>
Jodi Applegate: "Did you hear about the Weekly Reader poll 
that was out this week?"
<BR><DD>
Jack Ford: "Did you used to get them in school? I loved them."
<BR><DD>
Applegate: "Oh yeah. In 1972 I voted for McGovern, because  
'govern' was in his name. This was my thinking when I was seven 
years old. Anyway, they're uncannily accurate at predicting the 
outcome of the presidential campaign so we'll take a look at why 
that might be."
<P>
How much do you want to bet that she's voting for Clinton this 
year because she thinks the C in Clinton stands for "compassion"?

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#huang">revelation of John Huang's frequent white house visits</a> led Thursday's Good Morning America, but were not mentioned at all on Today or This Morning.
<li>Wednesday's <a href="#nbc">NBC Nightly News</a> did not include a word about Huang, but ABC and CBS did air stories on him.
<li>ABC's Jeff Greenfield explores <a href="#bias">whether liberal bias may explain</a> why scandals don't hurt Clinton. 
<li>Five days before the election <a href="#cnn">CNN bumped Inside Politics back a half hour</a> in order to show....
<li>The November 4 edition of the MRC's <a href="#nq">Notable Quotables.</a> 
</ol>
<a name="huang">
1) <b>"DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often: Log Shows 
Him There 78 Times Since July '95"</b> declared the front page story 
in the Thursday, October 31 <i>Washington Post</i>. The <i>Washington Times</i> 
headline read: <b>"Huang Frequent White House Visitor: Also Got Unusual 
Security Clearance Waiver."</b>
<BR><DD>
So, did these headlines prompt stories on the network morning 
shows? MRC analysts Steve Kaminski and Jim Forbes told me not on CBS 
This Morning or NBC's Today. Only GMA, MRC analyst Gene Eliasen observed, 
didn't ignore the news. GMA co-host Charlie Gibson opened the show:
<BR><DD>
"The lead story involves campaign fundraising. More fuel on the 
fire of that story that has been catching heat in the latter days of 
the campaign. John Huang, the fellow who was at the center of that 
Indonesian fundraising connection for the Democrats. The people in 
the administration have been downplaying his importance, but now 
there is word he made more than sixty visits to the White House in 
the first part of this year, those visits ending right away when 
those stories about Indonesian fundraising broke, and we'll have 
that in our newscasts throughout the morning."
<P>
Tuesday morning on Good Morning America Gibson had wondered 
why there wasn't more coverage of questions about Democratic 
fundraising, suggesting that "if Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them." (See last quote in Notable Quotables 
below.) The question remains for the other networks, but Thursday 
morning Gibson's reporting addressed his concerns.
<P>
<a name="nbc">
2) Thursday night NBC Nightly News failed to mention John 
Huang's name. Introducing a story on the Clinton campaign, Tom 
Brokaw announced: "For his part, President Clinton is attempting 
to cool off the controversies over his campaign contributions. 
NBC's Brian Williams is in California tonight ahead of the 
President's trip there."
<P>
But that was it. Williams said nothing about fundraising, 
instead reporting that "in Las Vegas he [Clinton] hit Dole on the 
tax cut plan. He reminded the audience about Dole's role, along 
with Gingrich, in shutting the government down during the winter."
<P>
Next, NBC aired a story from Lisa Myers on what will happen if 
Democrats win Congress. She began by noting that Dick Gephardt says 
"Democrats are more moderate than two years ago." She reported that 
"long time liberals who claim to have signed on to the new centrist 
agenda" would get the committee chairmanships. But she compared that 
to reality, asking Congressman Charles Rangel: "Are you committed 
to balancing the budget in six years?" Rangel shot back: "No."
<P>
On World News Tonight, Jackie Judd explored the latest on the 
John Huang front, noting the Republicans have asked if donors 
"were front men to donate money that came from illegal sources, 
and did large contributions influence foreign policy."
<P>
On the CBS Evening News Thursday, Dan Rather stated: "President 
Clinton's strategy to deal with the pre-election attacks is keep 
moving, change the subject and have aides handle damage control.
Case in point: Questions about John Huang, the Democratic fundraiser 
with easy access to heavy money interests in Asia. It now turns out 
Huang also had much easier access to the White House itself than was
previously disclosed."
<P>
Later in the show in a "Follow the Dollar" segment, a week after 
ABC did it, Linda Douglass examined John Huang's trail.
<P>
<a name="bias">
3) World News Tonight looked at why scandals don't damage 
Clinton and gave airtime to the liberal bias explanation. Peter 
Jennings introduced the October 31 story: "We have one additional 
report tonight on these many questions about the behavior, and in 
some cases the alleged behavior, of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton during 
these last few years. ABC's Jeff Greenfield tonight on what sticks 
and what doesn't and what may stick around."
<P>
<DD>Here's the end of Greenfield's piece:
<BR>
<DD>"Among Republicans, one of the most popular explanations for 
Clinton's invulnerability is a liberal media bias. And at least one 
journalist thinks the critics may have a point. A forthcoming article
in The American Lawyer magazine argues that Paula Jones' charges of 
sexual harassment against then-Governor Clinton are far more credible 
than those of Anita Hill against Judge Clarence Thomas. But the 
article's author says the Paula Jones case has been covered very 
differently."
<BR>
<DD>Stuart Taylor, The American Lawyer magazine: "Imagine if Paula Jones 
or someone just like her made allegations, just like this, with evidence
just like this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich."
Greenfield: "If the polls are right all these charges will have very
little impact on the election. But once the political season ends, they 
could cast giant cloud over a second Clinton term."
<P>
Indeed, though the American Lawyer piece has been out for a week,
as far as I know this is the first network mention.
<P>
<a name="cnn">
4) Five days before Americans vote CNN carried live coverage of 
TV talk show host Jenny Jones testifying in a Michigan murder trial 
instead of their daily politics show. CNN stayed with her past 4pm ET, 
the time for Inside Politics. She stepped down at about 4:20 and CNN 
carried Inside Politics a half hour late at 4:30pm.

<b>Gun to Our Heads</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Going into the homestretch, the campaign is taking on faint overtones 
of the old protection racket with Republicans increasingly sounding like 
the Capone gang, offering protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob." 
<i>-- ABC's John Cochran on House GOP strategy, October 27 This Week 
introductory story.</i>
<P>
<b>The Bad News is Really Good, Good News Really Not</b>
<BR>
<DD>"The government reports today that the economy slowed down over the 
summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 
percent growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was 
campaigning in Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling 
off is necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, 
the numbers were good news. Senator Dole on the other hand was in 
Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers 
are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected 
there could be a recession."<i> -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings, October 30 
World News Tonight.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD><i>Peter Jennings:</i> "The [2.7 percent GDP] rate is more than economists 
had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<i>Bob Jamieson: </i>"The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big 
appliances and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But 
many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking 
a sharp turn for the better." <i>-- World News Tonight, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<DD>"The government is out with its final official report on economic 
growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic slowdown. 
In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at an annual 
rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth rate of 
the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential candidates 
to put their own spins on today's economic numbers." <i>-- Dan Rather, 
Oct. 30 CBS Evening News.</i>
<center><b>vs.</b></center>
<DD>"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again,
but there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even 
if they are accurate, they may be too little too late to help 
President Bush because it was also announced today that consumer 
confidence in the economy continues to fall." <i>-- Rather on the 
October 27, 1992 CBS Evening News.</i> The GDP figure was later 
revised upward to 3.9 percent for the 3rd quarter.
<P>
<DD>"The economy was slow, but steady going in the last quarter. Many 
economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is 
under control and interest rates will stay low. But, Bob Dole has 
another vision." <i>-- Tom Brokaw, October 30 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<b>vs.</b>
<DD>"The President [Bush] tonight finally has an economic number that he 
can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking in today 
and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning around." 
<i>-- Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, October 27, 1992.</i>
<P>
<b>Relaying Democratic Spin as Fact</b>
<BR>
<DD>"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need 19 seats.
And as of today it looks like they could win them. Democrats are taking 
special aim at the Republicans elected in 1994. They're endangered in 
part because their leader is so unpopular. With the help of millions
of dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind
voters that these freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they 
shut down the government." <i>-- ABC's Cokie Roberts, October 18 World 
News Tonight.</i>
<P>
<b>Cheap Shot</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when he said, 
`Until death do us part?'" <i>-- CNN Talk Back Live host Susan Rook after the 
RNC's Ed Gillespie said Dole's "word is his bond." Quoted by Washington 
Post media reporter Howard Kurtz, October 21.</i>
<P>
<b>NBC: No Big Deal, Republicans Just as Bad</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts 
contributions from overseas." <i>-- Gwen Ifill on Perot's speech criticizing 
Clinton's illegal foreign donations, Oct. 24 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
<DD>"In a year when you talk about, corporations who give $25,000 chunks of 
money, why are people particularly outraged when people with last names 
like Cabrera and people from India and Korea and Indonesia and China 
all of a sudden get, there just seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing 
as a subtext in some of the criticism." <i>-- NBC News reporter Gwen Ifill 
on PBS's Washington Week in Review, October 25. Cabrera is now serving
 a 19-year sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S.</i>
<P>
<DD>"Beyond the tedium of the day to day campaigning, there's another much 
more alarming development this year -- money. Huge amounts of money 
pouring into both parties, raising very serious questions about 
influence and conflict of interest." <i>-- Tom Brokaw opening the 
October 29 NBC Nightly News.</i>
<P>
"Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse Helms, have also 
tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of these investigations will 
produce answers until months, or years, after election day." <i>-- Andrea 
Mitchell concluding her October 29 NBC Nightly News story.</i>
<P>
<DD>"On campaign finance, White House officials admit that both sides are 
dirty. The best defense: Republicans do it too." <i>-- Jim Miklaszewski, 
October 29 The News with Brian Williams on MSNBC.</i>
<P>
<b>Dole Was Okay When He Raised Taxes</b>
<DD>"Dole knows better. Columnist Matthew Miller has even fancifully suggested 
that the Senator's 15 percent tax cut proposal is really part of a secret 
Dole plan to have radical tax-cutting decisively repudiated at the polls. 
That way, the death of his political career can give life to the principle 
of fiscal responsibility that he devoted so many years of that career to 
advancing. If only." <i>-- Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, Oct. 21.</i>
<P>
<DD>"One of the roles of a journalist is to afflict the comfortable and 
comfort the afflicted. But after the debate ended, not one network news 
anchor or commentator noted the oddness of two presidential candidates 
hankering for tax handouts. Like Clinton and Dole, the anchors and 
television pundits earn more than 99 percent of all Americans. If 
those same TV commentators made say, $35,000 a year, they might 
have been more struck by Dole and Clinton's bantering." <i>-- U.S. 
News Senior Writer David Whitman, October 21</i>.
<P>
<DD>"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt. 
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining battle 
of his career." <i>-- Actress Blair Brown narrating Frontline on PBS, 
October 8.</i>
<P>
"Just a year later, when he saw that supply-side economics had 
ballooned the deficit, Dole worked hard to raise government revenues 
by closing tax loopholes, and pushing through what was then the 
argest tax increase in history." <i>-- Ken Bode narrating "Bob 
Dole's Odyssey" in CNN's Democracy in America, Oct 20.</i>
<P>
<b>Charles Should Be In Charge</b>
<BR>
<DD>"Bob Dole is running around the country saying, `Where is the 
outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic Party hiding 
this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out raising 
money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic national headquarters. Newsweek 
says you have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge 
gifts from people, businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist 
monks and nuns who have taken vows of poverty giving big amounts 
of money to the Democratic Party, and nobody seems to notice this. 
Somebody said the other day if the Republicans had done this the 
press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"

and Cokie Roberts, October 29.</i>

<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Here today, gone tomorrow. Tuesday night the three networks led with <a href="#stories">stories of Democratic fundraising.</a> Wednesday night neither ABC's World News Tonight or the CBS Evening News mentioned anything about Democratic fundraising. Only NBC Nightly News ran a piece.
<li>A tale of two campaigns. Third quarter GDP this year was below the rate in the same quarter in 1992. This year the networks gave a straight forward account, or offered a spin that favored Clinton. Announced one anchor: <a href="#slow">"The economy was slow,</a> but steady going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means inflation is under control." That's not the treatment George Bush got four years ago.
<li>ABC's Charlie Gibson cited several Clinton scandals Tuesday morning and <a href="#pressing">asked why the media aren't pressing Democrats:</a> "If the Republicans had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away with this?"
<li>A talk <a href="#host">show host and a former network news anchor</a> in bed together, add a little nudity on ABC, and you get... 
</ol>
<a name="stories">
1) The current issue of Newsweek includes a story about John 
Huang and a Clinton ally in Taiwan involved in questionable fundraising 
in that island nation. Wednesday's Los Angeles Times moved the story 
further. It began:
<br><dd>
"Mark Middleton, a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide 
from Arkansas, was responsible for arranging a controversial encounter 
between President Clinton and Liu Tai-ying, the chief financial manager 
of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party, in September 1995, officials said 
Tuesday." The LA Times went on to report that Liu offered to donate 
$15 million to the Clinton campaign, which would be illegal.
<P>
NBC Nightly News began Wednesday night (October 30) with three 
stories in a row on the campaign. In the third, Andrea Mitchell examined 
the Taiwan angle to the DNC/John Huang fundraising activities. She 
relayed allegations that a Clinton ally was "shaking down" Taiwan 
businessmen.
<P>
ABC or CBS coverage Wednesdsay night of this or any part of the 
DNC fundraising/Huang saga: Zilch. ABC didn't even air a full campaign 
story. CBS did relay Dole's newest target, as Phil Jones reported:
<BR><DD>
"Clinton White House ethical controversies also remained high on 
Dole's agenda. He took a swipe at Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's 
government travel, while reminding supporters what they could do with 
the money from his 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "You ought to take a vacation instead of Hazel O'Leary flying 
around the world at your expense."
<P>
<a name="slow">
2) In late October 1992 a 3rd quarter GDP of 2.7 percent was 
announced. October 30 of this year the 3rd quarter number was released: 
Just 2.2 percent. 
<P>
Wednesday night CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced the 
bad news: "The government is out with its final official report on 
economic growth before the election. And it indicates a dramatic 
slowdown. In the third quarter of the year the U.S. economy grew at 
an annual rate of just 2.2 percent, that is less than half the growth 
rate of the second quarter. It didn't take long for the presidential 
candidates to put their own spins on today's economic numbers."
<P>
Phil Jones did a story with Dole's reaction, followed by Rita Braver, 
who began: "Mr. Clinton did not mention the sharp economic slowdown in 
the last quarter. Instead, he looked at the overall numbers for the year 
and claimed things are just getting better..."
<P>
Up next, Ray Brady identified the culprit: falling consumer spending. 
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy 
was starting to pick up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that 
expression, 'It's the economy stupid'? And George Bush went down to 
defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but not 
enough so that most voters will be feeling it."
<P>
Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"? Could it be because the media
kept putting the worst possible spin on 1992 economic news? Well, to
find out I sojourned into the MRC tape library. Let's start with CBS. 
On October 27, 1992, the day of the GDP announcement, Dan Rather 
asserted: 
<BR><DD>
"Just one week before the election and the Bush administration says
the U.S. economy has turned the corner and started expanding again, but 
there is some doubt about the accuracy of the figures, and even if they 
are accurate, they may be too little too late to help President Bush 
because it was also announced today that consumer confidence in the
economy continues to fall."
<P>
Reporter Susan Spencer reported in from the Bush campaign: "He crowed 
today at upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though 
some economists warned that may not hold."
<P>
Rather was right about the number being inaccurate, but not in the
direction he thought. It was later revised upward to 3.9 percent for
the 3rd quarter.
<P>
On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show: "Today's 
unemployment report from the government appears hopeful on the surface.
It says the nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second 
month in a row. But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs 
program for teenagers. That program is about to end, and as Ray Brady 
reports, the picture ahead is bleak."
<P>
Brady: "...Bare minutes after the announcement, the Federal Reserve 
moved to cut interest rates to speed the economy. But those strikes and
layoffs at General Motors, and thousands of inner city kids soon to come
off those summer job payrolls. Those could mean bad news for next month's 
figures. After hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a 
tenth of a point again last month, most economists now predict next
month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent."
<P>
One month later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. Let's go to
the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News. Ray Brady skipped over his mistake
and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment 
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's 
largely because many Americans simply stopped looking for work, so 
they're no longer counted as unemployed....The fact is, 17 months 
after the recovery started, the economy is stuck in neutral, partly 
because business is running scared. It's not expanding like in a 
recovery, but it is cutting back like in a recession."
<P>
In between the two unemployment reports, on the September 15, 1992 
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began the broadcast: "Seven weeks now until 
election day and new figures out today indicate the economy is flat. 
The government officially reported today that retail sales plunged 
half a percent last month, biggest drop in five months, hardest hit 
appliances and automobiles. Another sign of a sluggish economy: 
consumer prices rose just three-tenths of a percent."
<P>
CBS was not the only culprit. Look at ABC and NBC.
<P>
<b>ABC's World News Tonight</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "In politics today, the economy as viewed from 
two sides. The government reports today that the economy slowed down 
over the summer. The Gross Domestic Product, which measures all economic 
activity, was up 2.2 percent, but that is less than half the 4.7 percent 
growth in the second quarter. President Clinton who was campaigning in 
Michigan noted that many economists say a cooling off is necessary to 
keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news. 
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with 
Mrs. Dole. He says the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say 
if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there could be a recession."
<P>
<DD>October 27, 1992
<BR><DD>
Peter Jennings: "The [2.7 percent GDP] is more than economists had 
projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." 
<BR><DD>
Bob Jamieson: "The increase in economic growth was driven by a surge 
in consumer spending. The best news came from spending for big appliances 
and furniture, which rose by nearly nine percent. But many economists say 
the report is not proof the economy is taking a sharp turn for the better."
<BR><DD>
The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President may 
complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he 
is so pleased about are not that definitive, according to a great many 
independent economic analysts."
<P>
<b>NBC Nightly News:</b>
<P>
<DD>October 30, 1996:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "We're now down to five full days before the election 
and the President is mostly protecting his lead while Bob Dole is 
looking for any last minute opening. And today again he tried the 
national economy. The economy was slow, but steady going in the last 
quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means 
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low. But, 
Bob Dole has another vision. So, we begin tonight with NBC's David Bloom."
<BR><DD>
Bloom told how "Bob Dole predicted today that Bill Clinton's 
re-election would plunge the nation into another recession." Jim 
Miklaszewski then gave Clinton's more upbeat spin.
<BR>
<DD>October 27, 1992 Nightly News:
<BR><DD>
Tom Brokaw: "The President tonight finally has an economic number 
that he can brag about, but at the same time consumers were checking 
in today and they're yet to be persuaded that this economy is turning 
around. The good number is the Gross Domestic Product, that's the rate 
of economic growth July through September. It hit 2.7 percent, that's 
well above what most economists predicted. But in this unusual economy, 
that's not enough, not with another report out today showing a sharp 
drop in consumer confidence."
<P>
All this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding
that "in September 1992, 98 percent of all sources on the evening news
criticized the state of the economy."
<P>
<a name="pressing">
3) Discussing the campaign with Cokie Roberts and Bill Kristol on 
Tuesday's Good Morning America, Charlie Gibson acknowledged media bias:
<BR><DD>
"Let me get to a second thing. Bob Dole is running around the country 
saying, 'Where is the outrage?' Where is it? We now have the Democratic 
Party hiding this guy John Huang until after the election, who was out 
raising money. You've got rafts of big contributors all listing the same 
address, which is the Democratic National headquarters. Newsweek says you 
have the ambassador to Taiwan out there soliciting huge gifts from people, 
businessmen in Taiwan and you have Buddhist monks and nuns who have taken 
vows of poverty giving big amounts of money to the Democratic Party, and 
nobody seems to notice this. Somebody said the other day if the Republicans 
had done this the press would be killing them. Why are they getting away 
with this?"
<P>
As noted above, Wednesday's World News Tonight didn't mention any of 
the topics raised by Gibson.
<P>
<a name="host">
4) So what are former CBS News anchor Connie Chung and husband Maury 
Povich up to? See for yourself, as USA Today's October 30 "People" section 
reported Povich's tale of the bedroom:
<BR><DD>
"Sharon Lawrence 'did me one of the great favors of all time,' the talk 
show host said on Tuesday's Fox After Breakfast. 'I've never met the woman, 
but the other night on the episode of NYPD Blue...her semi-nude shot. Connie 
and I were in bed and the shot comes on. I got very lucky. I really did. 
Thank you, Sharon Lawrence, until my dying day. One of the great nights 
of all time."
<P>
Wonder what happens when Maury orders up one of those pay-per-view 
cable movies?

<p>
<h3>Four items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#dnc">Washington Post's front page story on the DNC's decision to not file a FEC report on early October activities, followed later Tuesday by a reversal of that decision, and all on a day when John Huang gave a videotaped deposition, prompted the three broadcast networks to lead with DNC finances</a> Tuesday night.  But the networks also relayed the Democratic spin: Republicans do it too. NBC reported that "White House officials admit that both sides are dirty."
<li><a href="#attack">CBS Tuesday night labeled a Clinton attack "one the harshest,"</a> but it was more than harsh, it was downright preposterous.
<li>The <a href="#nyt">New York Times charged Tuesday that Bob Dole wants to destroy 32 years of civil rights work,</a> but the newspaper counts employer paid continuing education as a "civil right."  
<li><a href="#gorby">Tom Brokaw, hosting Tuesday's MSNBC InterNight, called Mikhail Gorbachev "a courageous, far-seeing prophet"</a> and said he hopes Gorbachev returns to office. 
</ol>

<a name="dnc">
1) Viewers of Tuesday morning's Today learned that
Republicans are "doing the same thing." As transcribed by MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens, 
<P>
<DD><i>Katie Couric asked Tim Russert</i>: "Tim, let's talk about the big news this morning. It's that the
Democratic National Committee will not file its required final
statement of campaign finances by November 5th. Which is really
unheard of. Why are they doing this?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert responded</i>: "Because they are afraid of what's in
there Katie, obviously. This has become an obscene process! It is
outrageous the amount of money that is pouring into both these
political parties! I do think the Democrats have probably taken
it to a new level, a lower level...."<br>
<DD><i>Couric then asked</i>: "Well Tim if Republicans are doing the
same thing what are people supposed to think?"<BR>
<DD><i>Russert</i>: "Well I think If anything comes of this is that the
American people and the media and other people of good intentions
in the political process will say,  Hey we embarrassed ourselves!
We elevated or lowered, excuse me, this political process to
levels of cynicism where the American people said,  Oh you all
take foreign money.' And they finally, finally do something to
clean up this mess. Because it has become a sewer Katie."
<P>
<i>On the CBS Evening News Tuesday night, Rita Braver concluded
her story from the trail with Clinton</i>: "Aides say he will
probably deliver a speech on campaign finance reform later in the
week, trying to paint Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich as the people
who stopped tougher laws."
<P>
<i>Tom Brokaw opened the October 29 NBC Nightly News</i>: 
    "If this campaign has an unofficial motto, it is this:  Wake
me when it's over.' But, beyond the tedium of the day to day
campaigning, there's another much more alarming development this
year -- money. Huge amounts of money pouring into both parties,
raising very serious questions about influence and conflict of
interest."
<P>
    <i>That led into story from Andrea Mitchell in which she
asserted</i>: "Of course Republicans, including Bob Dole and Jesse
Helms, have also tapped into foreign fundraising. And none of
these investigations will produce answers until months, or years,
after election day."
<P>
    Brokaw and Mitchell failed to distinguish between accepting
money from foreign nationals for campaign spending, which is
illegal, and getting money from Taiwan businessmen for a
foundation-run museum, as Helms did, which is legal.
<P>
    <i>Later, on MSNBC's The News with Brian Williams, NBC reporter
Jim Miklaszewski offered a nice spin that had the Clinton
campaign "admitting" the Republican are just a bad</i>: "On campaign
finance, White House officials admit that both sides are dirty.
The best defense: Republicans do it too."
<P>
<a name="attack">
2) Earlier in Rita Braver's piece cited above, she noted
that heckling from Ohio college students "provoked one of the
President's harshest attacks of the whole campaign on Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD><i>Clinton</i>: "I would be screaming too if I wanted a country that
took Head Start and Big Bird away from five year olds, school
lunches away from ten year years, summer jobs away from 15 year
olds and college loans away from 20 year olds."
<P>
    Harsh yes, but Braver could have noted the charge has no
basis in reality.
<P>
<a name="nyt">
3) <b>"Dole Attacks 32 Years of Civil Rights Laws"</b> declared a
October 29 <i>New York Times</i> headline. In an October 20 New York
review of Bill Clinton's civil rights record, reporter Steven
Holmes began: "In his nearly four years in office, President
Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of any
President in the last 30 years." Holmes insisted that George Bush
and Ronald Reagan "often seemed hostile or indifferent to civil
rights issues."
<P>
As pointed out to me by MRC analyst Clay Waters, The New York
Times has a pretty broad definition of civil rights. In a box
beside the Holmes story, the paper listed "promises in the civil
rights area that President Clinton made as a candidate in 1992."
Here are some:
<ul>
<li>"Lift caps on damage awards in sex discrimination cases."
<li>"Work to pass Motor Voter bill."
<li>"Support statehood for the District of Columbia."
<li>"Require every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training."
<li>"Expand Earned-Income Tax Credit."
</ul>
<a name="gorby">
4) Mikhail's Gorbachev's book tour brought him to MSNBC's
InterNight on Tuesday night, October 29. Tom Brokaw opened the
show:<br>
<dd>"It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on
your point of view. From the perspective of the West, the former
President of the Soviet Union of course was a courageous, far-seeing 
prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet 
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War."
<P>
    Thirty minutes later Brokaw concluded the interview with
another salute to the communist:<br>
<dd>"We always welcome you in this country, Mikhail Gorbachev.
We're especially pleased to have you tonight on InterNight. And
we offer our very best, of course, to Raisa Gorbachev and we hope
that you'll have a long and happy life. Perhaps one day again
we'll see you in political office in Russia. We know that you've
devoted your life to peace and to changing your country and those
of us who have gotten to know you count ourselves among the
privileged."
<P>
    From the perspective of a Western journalist, maybe, ignoring
both the internal collapse of communism despite Gorbachev's
efforts to save it and the role of Ronald Reagan.

<li><a href="#bash">Republican interest in drug dealer Jorge Cabrera and in money
from Indonesia is motivated by "foreigner bashing."</a> So says a
reporter for NBC News.
<li> A panel of <a href="#federal">federal judges on Friday asked the independent

generated any network coverage.

</ol>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bash">
<P>
<font size=+2>1)</font> On Friday's Washington Week in Review on PBS (October 25),
NBC's Gwen Ifill opined: "In a year when you talk about, corporations 
who give $25,00 chunks of money, why are people particularly outraged
when people with last names like Cabrera and people from India
and Korea and Indonesia and China all of a sudden get, there just
seems to be a lot of foreigner bashing as a subtext in some of
the criticism."
<P>
    It took Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Alan Murray
to tell her the obvious: "It is against the law for non-residents,
foreign companies, foreign governments to give money to political
campaigns. Now what's happening here is the money seems to be
legal residents, but some of them have admitted, I mean there was
this one woman who we talked to who admitted it wasn't her money.
Someone came and handed her $5,000, it was a money laundering
system."
<P>
    As for Cabrera, could it be that, well, he's now serving a 19-year
sentence for smuggling 6,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S?
<p>
<br>
<a name="federal">
<p><br>
<font size=+2>2) </font> On Friday a panel of judges authorized independent counsel
Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's
involvement in the FBI files matter.
<P>
     On the October 28 Today Sunday morning, NBC's Tim Russert
insisted: "This is dead serious. I mean the ethical problems
of the Clinton Administration are now troubling even to the most
partisan Democrats. The incident you're talking about is that
the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, requested
that the special prosecutor look into whether or not Bernard
Nussbaum, counsel to the President of the United States, lied
about Hillary Clinton's role in Travelgate. This is dead serious
stuff and I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an
election."
<P>
    So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? In Sunday's Washington Post Howard Kurtz reported that 
"it was not reported by the three network evening newscasts" Friday 
night. 
<P>
    That's not quite true, but it was hardly a major story. The CBS 
Evening News didn't mention the news. On ABC's World News Tonight
anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item. And how did Russert's NBC,
where he is Washington Bureau Chief, treat a story that he insists 
can't be dismissed nine days before election day? NBC Nightly News 
offered viewers only a brief item read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<P>
    In his Post piece, Kurtz quoted Russert's reaction to Dole's
liberal bias charge: "I find it ironic that Dole is criticizing the
media for not covering all the stories we broke. Whether it's the 
Indonesian gardener or the Buddhist monks, he should be crediting
the LA Times, Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
I think his anger is misplaced."
<P>
    Hmmm. Which media outlets didn't Russert credit? Any of the 
networks, not even his own.
<p>
<br>
<a name="dole">
<p><br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>3) </font> Affirmative action and immigration have been winning issues 
for Republicans in California and by coincidence they are just the 
subjects that NBC's David Bloom has tagged "divisive." 
<P>
    After showing a clip of a Dole immigration ad, on the Saturday, 
October 26 NBC Nightly News, Bloom concluded: "But even many Republicans 
who believe Dole could have won here on a divisive issue like 
immigration, now say it's too late." The next night, Sunday, Bloom 
concluded his story from California: "Until now, Dole on the campaign 
stump, had largely shied away from divisive social issues like 
affirmative action for fear of alienating swing voters. Not anymore."
<p>
<br>
<a name="al">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>4)</font> In the beginning of the show story Sunday for This Week
with David Brinkley, ABC's John Cochran looked at how Republicans
are now separating themselves from Dole, suggesting to voters that
they need a check on a re-elected Clinton. He concluded with this 
bizarre analogy: "Going into the the homestretch, the campaign
is taking on feint overtones of the old protection racket with
Republicans increasingly sounding like the Capone gang, offering
protection against Bugsy Clinton and his mob."
<p>
<br>
<a name="cbs">
<p><br>
<br>
<font size=+2>5) </font> Finally, a little reality check for Clinton. Here's an excerpt 
from Friday's CBS Evening News story by Bill Plante:
<P><blockquote>
    Plante: "But while Mr. Clinton walks the high road on the stump. 
His advertising, all of which he personally approves, has been 
overwhelmingly negative. He courted young voters today with a message 
of hope. A new ad courts senior voters with a message of fear."
<P> Clinton ad: "You've worked you whole life and hoped for a secure
retirememt. That's why it's so wrong that Dole and Gingrich tried
to slash Medicare $270 billion."
<P> 
   Plante: "Never mind that the President's own budget would have
cut future Medicare spending almost as much."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Now that the election is in the bag for Clinton it's safe for the
networks to scrutinize his claims.

<H3>Five items today:</H3>
<ol>
<li>In an address at the National Press Club on Thursday, <a href="#Perot">Ross Perot rejected the Dole campaign's overture to endorse Dole</a> and he criticized Bill Clinton's character. The three evening shows highlighted the first, but ABC's World News Tonight failed to report Perot's anti-Clinton comments. Both ABC and NBC charged that Bob Dole "lashed out" at Clinton." NBC's Gwen Ifill complained that "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though he also accepts contributions from overseas." On CBS, Phil Jones said the Perot gambit demonstrates that Dole is "determined to try anything."
<li>After Wednesday's order proved fruitless, on Thursday a federal judge issued another order <a href="#huang">demanding the DNC to produce John Huang.</a> Of the broadcast network evening shows, only ABC's World News Tonight reported the effort to locate him.
<li>On CBS, Dan Rather offered an uncritical look at video of <a href="#devout">Bill Clinton hugging a "devout Catholic"</a> after convincing her that it was okay for him to veto the partial birth abortion bill.
<li>NBC's Lisa Myers contended on MSNBC that <a href="#tax">tax cuts are incompatible with balancing the budget.</a> By promising a tax cut, she charged, Bob Dole "seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<li>Republican House <a href="#chenoweth">freshman Helen Chenoweth</a> told Tom Brokaw that she's "just a plain spoken Western woman." Brokaw countered on Thursday's Nightly News: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right." 
</ol>
<a name="Perot">    
1) Thursday night (October 24) ABC's World News Tonight made
no mention of Perot's comments about Clinton's character. Instead,
ABC emphasized Dole's attack, saying he was "livid" when he 
criticized the media. Anchor Diane Sawyer announced: "In a speech 
in Florida Mr. Dole lashed out at the President and a lot of other 
people too."
<P>
<DD>Reporter Jim Wooten began: "Clearly frustrated by his stalled 
campaign, Senator Dole was fiercely critical today not only of the 
American media, but of the American public as well for not recognizing 
his virtues and the President's vices....As for the press, he was 
practically livid, telling an audience of the faithful in Pensacola
that the sins of the Clinton administration are being concealed by 
partisan newspapers and networks."
<BR><DD>
Dole: "Now we know the liberal media's not going to report on all 
these things because they want him re-elected. They like it the way 
it is. We need the media to tell the American people the truth and the 
truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a landslide."
<P>
    NBC Nightly News did run clips of Perot's attacks on Clinton, 
but in trying to lessen the damage to Clinton Gwen Ifill failed 
to distinguish between accepting money from foreign nationals, which is 
illegal, with getting money from U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies 
or from naturalized citizens, which is legal:
<BR><DD>
    Gwen Ifill: "Ross Perot attempted to blast his way back into 
contention today with a scathing indictment of President Clinton and 
the Democratic party's fundraising tactics, which includes accepting 
money from abroad."
<BR><DD>
    Perot: "If you love this country and your children, how could you 
even consider voting for a candidate that has huge moral, ethical and 
criminal problems facing him as our country has problems to solve."
<BR><DD>
    Ifill: "Perot barely mentioned Republican Bob Dole, even though 
he also accepts contributions from overseas."
<P>
    Next, David Bloom reported in from the Dole campaign. His piece
began:
<BR><DD>
    "Spurned by Ross Perot, an admittedly frustrated Bob Dole lashed 
out today at voters"
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "Wake up America."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "At President Clinton's ethics."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "This is a disgrace."
<BR><DD>
    Bloom: "And especially at the liberal media, who Dole blamed for 
trying to engineer his defeat."
<BR><DD>
    Dole: "We need the media to tell the American people the truth, 
and the truth is Bill Clinton ought to be voted out of office in a 
landslide."
<BR><DD>
    On the CBS Evening News this is how Phil Jones concluded his story
on Perot and Dole: "Perot says he finds the whole Dole request to be 
weird. Was it an act of desperation? No says one top Dole aide. He 
calls it determined, determined to try anything."
<P>
<a name="huang">
2) Last Sunday, DNC General Chairman Chris Dodd promised that 
John Huang would be made available to the media. So far, no one's been
able to find the DNC fundraiser (and former Commerce Department 
official) responsible for bringing in the illegal $250,000 from 
South Korea and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other questionable
donations from overseas. On Thursday, a federal judge took action. As
reported by Brian Ross on Thursday's World News Tonight (October 24):
<P>
    Brian Ross on John Huang: "In Washington today, a federal judge 
ordered Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce 
John Huang to testify in a civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the 
Commerce Department for big Democratic contributors. The judge's unusual 
action came after Huang could not be found at his home in Glendale 
California or when U.S. Marshall's went to an address yesterday in 
Washington that the judge had ordered the Commerce Department to 
provide..."
<P>
    Reporter Mark Litke followed with a dispatch from Jakarta on 
the Lippo conglomerate's Asian empire and ties to Clinton.
<P>
    While ABC thus updated viewers on the Indonesian scandal, neither
CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News mentioned the scandal or Huang's
name. (CNN's Inside Politics did offer an anchor-read brief.)
<P>
<a name="devout">
3) Over video of Bill Clinton along a rope line talking with a 
teenage girl who at first is crying, then is smiling and, finally, is 
hugging Clinton, Dan Rather announced on the October 24 CBS Evening 
News: 
<BR><DD>
    "In Louisiana President Clinton had this tearful encounter today 
with a teenager. She said she was a devout Catholic and was upset with 
the President's veto of a bill banning late-term abortions. The 
President spoke with her awhile, saying he had vetoed that bill after
talking with women who might have died without the procedure. As you 
see, this seemed to satisfy the teenager who said she felt better and 
would tell her mother 'it's okay to vote for President Clinton,' 
unquote."
<P>
   Of course, Rather didn't bother telling viewers that the bill 
Clinton vetoed had a life or health of the mother exception.
<P>
<a name="tax">
4) MSNBC's News with Brian Williams on Tuesday night (October
22) ran a profile of Dole by Lisa Myers. It began:
<P>
    Lisa Myers: "The heart and soul of Dole's agenda is his economic 
program, built around the bold, some say extravagant, promise."
<BR><DD>
    Bob Dole: "We'll have a President who will cut taxes 15 percent 
across the board for every taxpayer in America."
<BR><DD>
    Myers: "With that promise, that half a trillion dollar tax cut, 
Dole seems to have cast aside the most enduring commitment of his 
35 year career -- balancing the budget."
<P>
<a name="chenoweth">
5) Thursday night Tom Brokaw narrated an "In-Depth" segment
exploring big money from special interests pouring into congressional
races. His case study: The Idaho race of GOP freshmen Helen
Chenoweth (targetted by labor unions) vs. Democrat Dan Williams.
<P>
    Brokaw asserted: "Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term 
Republican Congresswoman."
<BR><DD>
    Chenoweth: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I 
come from an innocuous state. I'm just a plain-spoken Western woman."
<BR><DD>
    Brokaw: "Not exactly. In her first term Chenoweth was a cheerleader 
for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum wage, 
trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hardliner 
on gun laws. So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists."
<P>
    Brokaw didn't make any negative comments about the views espoused
by the Democratic candidate. He concluded by noting that the two
candidates have debated, "But their campaigns are trapped in a cloud 
of money, saturating the air, polluting the political process, and 
that's a loss for everyone."
<P>
    So is a campaign trapped in a cloud of media distortion, polluting
the fair and balanced dissemination of political views.

<li>Developments on the <a href="#foreign">foreign citizen fundraising</a> front continue, but TV network viewers don't hear anything about them. On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported a major DNC donor had no money of his own to donate and a federal judge issued a subpoena for John Huang, now in hiding. None of the broadcast networks reported the first item; only one reported the second, but two found time to mention the sentencing of a Dole fundraiser. 
<li>NBC's Today on Wednesday reported nothing about the campaign during its two hour broadcast, but devoted a top of the show segment to a major crisis: Denial of <a href="#toilet">toliet paper to Detroit public school students</a>. 
<li>One Wednesday newspaper headline declared that Clinton is maintaining lead in California. Another the same day relayed that Dole and <a href="#catching">Republicans are catching up</a>.

<li>Dole's not gaining in the polls, so what's to blame. A CBS reporter Wednesday morning suggested "that his harsh <a href="#backfired">tactics may have backfired."</a> 
<li>A wealthy <a href="#actor">Hollywood actor and producer</a> identified, on Wednesday's NBC Nightly News, what ails America: Too much concern about making money. 
</ol>
<p>
<a name="foreign">
1) <b>"$325,000 Gift to Democrats Raises New Set of Questions:
Relative of Mahatma Gandhi Who Made Donation Say's he's Now in
Debt. DNC Calls Money Legal."</b> -- October 23 <i>Los Angeles Times</I>
front page.  
<P>
    It's illegal for foreign citizens to contribute to U.S.
campaigns, so the question in the case of Gandhi is whether
his donation really came from foreign nations.
<P>
    Keeping that in mind, here's the lead of the LA Times
story:<b> "The state of California says Yogesh K. Gandhi owes
$10,000 in back taxes. His California driver's license has
been revoked because he has failed to pay his traffic fines.
Claiming pauper status, he did not pay the $20 filing fee for
his divorce.
<BR><DD>"Yet Gandhi...gave a hefty a hefty $325,000 to the Democratic
National Committee....Gandhi emerged Tuesday as the latest in
a series of campaign donors whose contributions are raising
questions about the influence of foreign money in American politics.
Like the others, Gandhi's contribution was handled by John Huang,
the DNC fundraiser who brought in a series of six-figure donations,
some of which have proven illegal or suspect."</b>
<BR><DD>Speaking of Huang, he went into hiding last week to avoid the
media. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a subpoena for him
to appear.
<P>
    How were these two developments reported Wednesday night? The 
LA Times story was not reported by any of the three evening shows
-- not ABC's World Nes Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
    Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena for Huang. On
the CBS Evening News Dan Rather noted, without offering any 
specifics, how the Clinton team were trying to ignore the foreign
money angle and had asked the FEC to investigate. Eric Engberg then
did a Reality Check on how it takes years for the FEC to complete
an investigation. 
<P>
    But immediately after Engberg's piece, Dan Rather announced that
Simon Fireman, a former Dole fundraiser, had been ordered to pay $6
million in fines for laundering money to avoid contribution limits.
NBC's Tom Brokaw also mentioned Simon as he introduced a piece by
Lisa Myers on soft money fundraising by both parties. 
<P>
<a name="toilet">
2) Thirteen days until the election, but on Wednesday
Today couldn't find time for any mention of the campaign, MRC
analyst Geoffrey Dickens observed. But Today devoted the second
segment of the 7am half hour to a major crisis in Detroit:
access to toilet paper in the schools. 
<P>
    Interviewing David Snead, superintendent of the Detroit 
schools, Bryant Gumbel became enraged at the new rules which
restrict how much toilet paper students can use. He demanded:
"Hang on one second! One second! I saw a quote, one second!
David Snead I saw a quote from Charlie Fobbs. He is your Director 
of Housekeeping and Grounds for your school district. He said,
his words, 'They need to teach them, the students, to use only
the amount they need.' Isn't the matter of how much toilet paper
one needs rather personal?" 
<P>
    Gumbel's latest definition of civil rights: Unlimited access
to toilet paper. How long until Clinton proposes a federal
"Equal Access to Toilet Paper Act"?
<P>
<a name="catching">
3) Two contrasting headlines from Wednesday October 23:
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of the Los Angeles Times: <b>"Clinton Keeping 
Solid Lead Over Dole in State"</b>
<BR><DD>
    On the front page of Investor's Business Daily: <b>"California 
Vote Is Back in Play: Shrinking Gap in Polls Spurs a Heavy GOP Push"</b>
<P>
<a name="backfired">
4) On Wednesday's This Morning on CBS reporter Sandra 
Hughes offered her opinion of why Dole isn't catching up.
As caught and transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski, this is 
how she concluded her October 23 story: <b>"Dole criticized Clinton 
for raising taxes and breaking campaign promises. But over the 
past few days, his tough talking rhetoric has been noticeably 
toned down even though Dole won't admit that his harsh
tactics may have backfired."</b>
<P>
    Maybe if the media didn't condemn as "harsh" every anti-Clinton 
comment made by Dole, his pointing out some of Clinton's character
problems wouldn't have "backfired."
<p>
<a name="actor">
5) Starting this week and through election day, NBC Nightly
News is running a series called <i>"Fixing America"</i> in which various
leaders in different fields tell what they think should be done.
Wednesday night's offerings included this from actor/producer
Henry Winkler, aka "The Fonz" in Happy Days back in the 1970s:
<br><DD>
    "I think that we have to humanize America. I think that the 
worst thing that ever happened to this country was the quarterly 
report. The pride of process. The pride of what we do and the 
people who do it, the population, are being moved aside just so 
that we can show a profit three or four times a year. I think 
we're going to bottom line ouservelves into oblivion."
<P>
    Remember that before you put any money down to buy a ticket
to one of his future movies.

<h2>***Media Research Center CyberAlert***</h2>
<i>10/21/96</i><p>
<p>
</center>
<p>
<h3>Three items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>ABC's Cokie Roberts reported that <a href="#freshmen">Newt Gingrich and the House freshmen</a> "shut down the government."
<li>The <a href="#sandinistas">Sandinistas were just "socialists"</a> according to Peter Jennings. And ABC's Beth Nissen relayed that Daniel Ortega's theme song is Beethoven's Ode to Joy and his TV ads portray him as a "Latino Gandhi."
<li>The networks ignored the pardon issue for weeks and have yet to report anything about <a href="#livingstone">Craig Livingstone's assistant Mari Anderson</a> contradicting his story on the FBI files, but Washington Post reporter Howard Kurtz thinks a panel of reporters would have raised the topics in last week's debate. 
</ol>
<a name="freshmen">
<hr>
1) On Friday's World News Tonight (October 18), ABC's Cokie
Roberts explored whether Democrats might take back control of the
House. When conservatives complain that the media are
misinforming the public about Medicare cuts and how the
Republicans closed down the government, reporters counter that
they are only reporting what "Democrats say." Well, Roberts said
they "remind voters" of how Republicans caused the shutdown, as
if no responsibility for the shutdown can be placed on Bill
Clinton. Here's the beginning of her piece:
<P>
"To take back the House of Representatives the Democrats need
19 seats. And as of today it looks like they could win them.
Democrats are taking special aim at the Republicans elected in
1994. They're endangered in part because their leader is so
unpopular. With the help of millions of dollars from organized
labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down
the government...."
<P>
<a name="sandinistas">
<hr>
2) Later on Friday's World News Tonight, ABC previewed
Sunday's election in Nicaragua. Peter Jennings announced:    
"Under the heading of 'Whatever Happened To' we go to visit a man
who a decade ago was a very big thorn in the American side. The
United States sent hundreds of millions of dollars to Nicaragua
to defeat the Sandinistas and Daniel Ortega was their commander.
Ultimately the socialist programs of the Sandinistas and Mr.
Ortega fell out of favor. But there is a presidential election in
Nicaragua this Sunday and Daniel Ortega is back."
<p>
Reporter Beth Nissen found that "Daniel Ortega has changed
his tune. Literally, from militaristic Sandinista songs, to
Beethoven's Ode to Joy." And, she told viewers how "The new
Daniel is portrayed in his campaign ads as contemplative,
reverent, a man who cares deeply about the poor, a kind of Latino
Gandhi."
<p>
<a name="livingstone">
<hr>
3) In a Friday piece reviewing Wednesday night's
presidential debate, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz
noted how the "average citizen" questioners didn't help Dole by
asking about Clinton's ethics. Kurtz then wrote: "If reporters had
been asking the questions, you can bet there would have been
aggressive demands to know whether Clinton planned to issue any
Whitewater pardons and who had hired Craig Livingstone and why
Dole was raising the 'character' issue and so on."
<p>
Hello. Has Kurtz been on Mars the past few weeks? Print
reporters, maybe. But which of the broadcast TV network reporters
who have yet to report the six month gap in the log book of who
accessed the FBI files, the fact that Livingstone's assistant
said he knew he was improperly obtaining Bush administration
files, and who never mentioned the pardon issue for more than a
week after Clinton raised the subject on the NewsHour, did Kurtz
expect to suddenly be interested in Clinton scandals? -- Brent
Baker

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<p>
<li><FONT  SIZE=-1>But first, a quick correction: The quote from the CBS
Evening News cited in yesterday's CyberAlert was incorrectly
attributed to Bill Plante. In fact, the quote came from Phil
Jones.</FONT>
<ol>
<li><a href="#worried">Before Wednesday night's debate reporters worried</a> about
Dole's more aggressive plan. NBC's Matt Lauer said it meant the
campaign "is now getting meaner." On CBS, Phil Jones worried
that in a "town meeting" format, Dole may be seen as "being too
mean." Dan Rather warned that Dole planned to unload a "carpet
bombing on character."
<li><a href="#face">On Face the Nation, Bob Schieffer asked</a> if Dole's tax cut
proposal is responsible for "the economic mess that the country
is in."
<li><a href="#quiz">A quiz question</a>: A man identified as a "Democratic
strategist" has been making the rounds of TV shows to provide
the pro-Clinton spin. He is married to which network
correspondent who is covering the Clinton campaign?
</ol><br>
<a name="worried">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> Today show news anchor Matt Lauer opened the 7am
newscast on Wednesday (October 16) by blaming Dole for causing a
mean campaign. As transcribed by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens:
"Good morning everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego."
<p>
On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones showed
a clip of him shouting questions about debate strategy at Bob
Dole as Dole got into his car:
<blockquote>
   Phil Jones: "Ethics?"<BR>
   Dole: "Maybe."<BR>
   Jones: "Do you worry about it backfiring if you get into that?"<BR>
   Dole shook his head, and Jones then explained:<p>
   "Well, attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole
because of the debate format. The candidates will be facing
voters who are asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole
has never been able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he
got back in his 1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing
he needs tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the
questioners who thinks he's being too mean."
</blockquote>
Introducing the next story from Rita Braver on the Clinton
beat, Rather asked: "Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing
for a kind of carpet bombing on character?"
<p>
<a name="face">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> Most analysts suggest that Dole's 15 percent tax cut
plan has not been a more effective campaign issue because people
don't believe he'll follow through. Not Bob Schieffer. He thinks
Dole's problem is that people believe he's committed to the
supply-side theory behind the plan. 
<p>
    On the October 6 Face the Nation, Schieffer asked Ross
Perot: "You mentioned the economic mess that the country is in.
The keystone of the Dole campaign at this point seems to be a 15
percent across the board tax cut. That seems to go against a lot
of the things that Senator Dole has said in the past. I know
that you personally would not have gone in that direction. But
do you think that is one of the reasons that the Dole campaign
is running behind as it is now? What do you think of the 15
percent tax cut? Is it at all realistic? Could that be done?"
<p>
<a name="quiz">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> Quiz answer: Rita Braver, the White House correspondent for
CBS News. Her husband: Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer who
played George Bush in mock debates with Bill Clinton in 1992. In
addition to Clinton, he served as a debate coach for Michael
Dukakis and Walter Mondale. Wednesday night he appeared on CNN
both before and after the debate, identified on screen as a
"Democratic strategist."
<p>
How convenient. Rita Braver gets the Clinton spin at work
and at home.

rebound. Here's the introduction and beginning of their story of
the state of cities this election year:
<blockquote>
Peter Jennings: "Here in Detroit itself we've noticed a
difference. It was impossible to come here in years past without
the state of the city itself being an issue. Not this year, not
here. And as ABC's Dean Reynolds reports tonight, not in many
other places as well."</blockquote>

Dean Reynolds, over video of a building being torn down: 
<blockquote>
"In Detroit this morning it was down with the old. Down with the
high-rise symbols of urban rot to be replaced by new
neighborhoods. Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office."
Mayor Dennis Archer: "There is a sense that there is a
relationship between the city of Detroit and Washington and that
it is positive."

Bowen examined some hot House contests. As transcribed by MRC
analyst Steve Kaminski, here's how Bowen described the choice
voters face in a California district:
<blockquote>
    Jerry Bowen: "In the 22nd District along California's
central coast, freshman incumbent Andrea Seastrand is in the
fight of her political life. Challenged again by Democrat Walter
Capps, the college professor she defeated by less than 1 percent
of the vote last time. It is a contest of stark contrasts. The
55 year-old Seastrand: ultra-conservative, pro-life, pro-assault
weapons, anti-gay, anti-illegal immigrant."
<P>
</blockquote>
    After a soundbite from Republican Seastrand, Bowen continued: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"The soft spoken 62 year-old Capps, liberal down the line: abortion
rights, gay rights, gun control, opposed to the death penalty."

<LI><a href="#correction">A correction</a> and a clarification of previous MRC CyberAlerts. Plus, a fact checking error from ABC on Jack Kemp.

</OL>
<a name="correction">
<H3>1) A clarification and a correction of two topics from MRC CyberAlerts from last week.</H3>
<P>
First, the October 8 CyberAlert reported that on Monday night
(October 7) ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
fact check stories on the Dole-Clinton debate. In fact, CBS
Evening News did, but ABC's piece aired on Good Morning America,
not World News Tonight. In addition, CNN's Brooks Jackson did a
fact check piece for Inside Politics.
<P>
Second, the October 11 CyberAlert noted that unlike in 1992,
this year neither ABC's World News Tonight or CNN's Inside
Politics ran fact checking stories on the VP debate. That's
correct, but MRC analyst Gene Eliasen pointed out to me that
ABC's Good Morning America did run one Thursday morning.
<P>
<DD>ABC reporter Jack Smith asserted: "Both men indicated that
taxes are too high, right? But federal taxes as a portion of
household income are actually lower now than they were 15 years
ago. Kemp made this assertion."
<BR>
<DD>Jack Kemp: "Every time in this century we've lowered the tax
rates across the board revenues went up, not down."
<BR>
<DD>Smith: "Wrong again. The last time this was tried, in 1981,
real income tax revenues fell three years in a row and drove up
the deficit."
<P>
Reality Check: Following the 1982 recession, income tax
revenue grew consistently. As Norman Ture pointed out in Ed
Rubenstein's book The Right Data, "With the recovery beginning in
late 1982, budget receipts expanded rapidly, on the average by
slightly over 8 percent a year, through fiscal 1990."

<H3>2) On Friday, a study appearing in the Journal of
Epidemiology and Community Health, was released.</H3> It showed that
abortion is responsible for 5,000 cases of breast cancer each
year. ABC's Peter Jennings Friday night (October 11) delivered
not a news report but a warning:
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings: "There was a study released at Penn State
University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had
abortions and the risk of developing breast cancer. And if you
see it around, remember this. It is not original research, but an
analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute
says those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and
because of that, various other scientists say today the Penn
State report is flawed."
<P>
Jennings did not have to worry: While on CNN's The World
Today Jeff Levine provided a full report about the study and its
critics, neither CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News even
mentioned the study.
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<H3>3) CBS has turned a self-serving Clinton anecdote into a 
prime time movie.</H3> Here's an exchange from Friday's Late, Late
Show with Tom Snyder:
<P>
<DD>Les Moonves, CBS entertainment division President: "The President
did actually pitch me a movie of the week idea which we ended up
shooting....It's unusual when the President of the United States
pitches you, actually a wonderful movie of the week."
<BR>
<DD>Tom Snyder: "What was it, a young guy from Arkansas becomes
President?"
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "No, it was about the Family and Medical Leave Act, a
true story that he was involved in where a young girl had visited
the White House. He'd come back from his morning jog, and this 13
year old girl was there in a wheelchair. The President went over
to her and she evidently was dying of leukemia and the father
went over to him and thanked the President for having passed the
Family and Medical Leave Act so he could be with his daughter.
She was going to die, but at least he could say good-bye. As the
President pitched it, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,
legitimately. It was very moving. We ended up shooting the movie
starring John Ritter as the father and the President appears in
it as himself."
<BR>
<DD>Snyder: "You will stop at nothing."
<BR>
<DD>Moonves: "I will. I'm shameless for ratings, what can I tell you.
But we're not allowed to show it until after the elections."
<P>
To get to the truth of the anecdote, do we divide by six or by two?
<P>
<a name="dole">
<H3>4) In the media lexicon, anything about character or illegality is harsh and/or nasty.<BR></H3>
 Two examples:
<BR>
<DD>Monday night (October 14) this is how David Bloom began his
NBC Nightly News story: "In his harshest, most personal attack
yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton
Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is
slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal
campaign contributions."
<BR>
<DD>The night before, on ABC's World News Sunday, anchor Carole
Simpson asked: "The candidates are back on the road, but will
they take the high road or the low road?"
<BR>
<DD>Reporter John Donvan observed: "Did Bob Dole attack Bill
Clinton in harsh terms today? Yes he did. Plenty."
<BR>
<DD>Dole: "Drug use has doubled because nothing has been done in
this administration. He's been AWOL. He's been AWOL before, but
now he's really been AWOL now."
<BR>
<DD>Donvan: "But did Dole get personal, dig into the President's
past, stir up the mud of Whitewater and other issues of
character? No, he isn't. And despite being urged to do so by some
members of his own party. Dole in person is still taking the high
road, hitting the President hard on his record but not going
after Clinton on his personal life and moral character. Some in
Dole's camp wish that he'd get nastier at this point with polls
delivering constant bad news to the campaign."
<P>
Following a clip of Dole saying he's "thinking about" being
tougher and a soundbite from Jack Kemp, Donvan concluded his
story: "Dole himself continues to be the gentleman on the stump.
That may make for a duller campaign than some would like, and
perhaps a losing one. But it lets the candidate play out this
possibly climatic moment in his career more like a statesman,
less like a nasty politician. John Donvan, ABC News, Hamilton New
Jersey."
<P>
Just what reporters want. Dole to lose while not damaging Clinton.

<a name="conservative">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>1)</font>On Thursday's CBS Evening News, reporter Phil Jones
concluded his piece on the Dole campaign with a conservative spin
on Kemp's debate performance: 
    "In private, off the record discussions, with both Dole and
Kemp aides there's a strong sense of disappointment in Kemp's
debate performance. They talk about missed opportunities, the
feeling that Kemp let the Vice President take credit for issues
like welfare reform. As one Dole aide asked cynically, 'Did he
study much?'"
<P>
<br>
<a name="extreme">
<P>
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>2)</font>)Later in the October 10 CBS broadcast, Bob Schieffer
traveled to Ohio's 6th CD which encompasses the southern part of
the Buckeye state. For the House seat, Republican freshman Frank
Cremeans faces his 1994 opponent, Democrat Ted Strickland.
Schieffer stated as fact that the Republican House shut the
government down, ignoring the at least equal role of the
President in refusing to sign continuing resolutions or
appropriation bills. 
<P>
    Here's the second half of the story:
<P>
Schieffer: "Now the two are back for a re-match that typifies the
predicament many Republican freshmen are finding. The revolution
and its talk of changing things like Medicare backfired with some
voters. Just ask the Republican county chairman here."<br>
Roger Bennett, Clinton County Republican Chairman: "I think
they've lost confidence in Newt Gingrich."<br>
Schieffer: "Remember, he's the Republican, not the Democratic
chairman. Why is that? Did you just go too far?"<br>
Bennett: "I think he went too far and I think if you make a
mistake you back up and say, 'darn it I made a mistake,' and you
go back and do it over again the right way."<br>
Schieffer: "Where did he make the mistake? In shutting down the
government."<br>
Bennett: "I think that is the big thing because it involved all
the older people They were really concerned. It scared the
Dickens out of them."<br>
<P>
<br>
   Having established the GOP as the culprits for the shutdown,
Schieffer concluded by endorsing the Democratic candidate's view
that House Republicans are extremists:
<br>
Schieffer: "One reason Republican Cremeans, a Gingrich stalwart
in Washington, stresses the local angle here. Is your opponent
running against Newt Gingrich or is he running against you.
Cremeans: "Well, you'd have to ask him that. What I've tried to
do is represent the district."<br>
Schieffer: "For sure, his opponent promises the same. He's
learned a lesson too."<br>
Strickland: "And that lesson is that people want moderation and
when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or
from the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from
that."<br>
Schieffer: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland
and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are
running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time.
Bob Schieffer, CBS News, Chillicothe Ohio."<br>
<P>
<br>
<a name="fact">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2> 3)</font> After the 1992 VP debate, both ABC's World News Tonight
and CNN's Inside Politics ran fact checking stories which were
dominating by corrections of Dan Quayle. This year, The
Washington Post ran a piece October 10 citing errors made by Kemp
and Gore. The Post identified five errors made by Gore. But, this
year neither ABC or CNN ran a reality check piece.
<P>
    Of course, you can't always trust the fact checkers. Post
reporter Michael Weisskopf offered this "correction" on Kemp:
"Kemp...defended the tax proposal by arguing that every tax cut
in the 20th century has produced higher government revenue. But
many economists disagree. The huge Reagan tax cut in 1981
resulted in a tripling of the budget deficit over a dozen years."
<P>
   Talk about apples and oranges. Taxes were cut, but as the
numbers show, tax revenue grew faster than inflation in the
1980s. Spending soared even faster, leading to higher deficits.
<P>
<br>
<a name="pbs">
<P>
<br>
<font size=+2>4) </font> Speaking of Reagan bashing, MRC associate editor Tim
Graham caught some in Tuesday night's PBS Frontline special, The
'96 Choice. Actress Blair Brown, who narrated the show, stated:
"By 1985, Reagan's economics had plunged the country into debt.
Dole's all-out fight to lower the deficit became the defining
battle of his career."
<P>
<br>
<a name="night">
<P>
<br>
<br>
   <font size=+2>5) </font> With several presidential biographers as guests, on
Thursday's (October 10) MSNBC InterNight Bryant Gumbel explored
presidential character. Much of the show was devoted to defending 
Bill Clinton's character. Here are a few of Gumbel's questions:
<blockquote>
    -- Talking about Clinton, Gumbel asked The Washington Post's
David Maraniss: "In the first two years this is a man who tried
his best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight
for gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    He tried to balanced the budget?
<P>
  <blockquote>  -- "Do any of those things of which Bill Clinton is charged,
when it comes to character, have much to do with governing
effectively, or with leading?"
</blockquote>
<P>
    Having failed to mention anything about lying and Clinton,
Gumbel moved on to Reagan.
<P>
<blockquote>    -- To Reagan biographer Lou Cannon: "Lou, I know you feel as
if Reagan had few, if any, character flaws. But let me ask you
this. When one sidesteps, or refuses to acknowledge the
consequences of their policies or actions, why shouldn't that be
viewed as a character flaw? Or when one lies. For example, let me
roll a clip and then we'll come back. This one deals with Iran-Contra."
</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>
    -- A segment later, he returned to Reagan, asking Cannon if
it was true "that while he appeared to be empathetic, his
policies caused enormous suffering for those who were least able
to afford it?"
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<a name="bob">
<P>
<br>
<br>
 <font size=+2>6)</font> Appearing on NBC's Tonight Show Thursday night (October
10), NBC and MSNBC reporter/anchor Brian Williams told Jay Leno
the following anecdote (ALL CAPS = Williams impersonating Bob
Dole yelling):
<blockquote>
   Brian Williams: "I was watching his acceptance speech in San
Diego, which was really the speech of his life, it was a very
dramatic event. And I'm standing there with one of our younger
producers at MSNBC. She's 24 or something and I said 'What do you
think?' She said, 'You know, he scares me.' And I said, 'What do
you mean he scares you?' She said 'It doesn't matter what he's
trying to say, it doesn't matter what the speech says or how well
he's doing it, all I hear him say is GET OFF MY LAWN! I have this
mental image. I'm playing with my friends on the rich guy's lawn
and the guy comes to the door, with his little pen, you know, and
says GET OFF MY LAWN!'" 
</blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Talk about image over substance. And not much sensitivity toward
the disabled.

<OL>
<LI><a href="#bozo">Dole's reaction to a man in a crowd calling Bill Clinton "Bozo"</a> generated media condemnation on Wednesday. Boston Globe and USA Today stories portrayed Bozo as part of a grand strategy. On Today, Katie Couric charged that the campaign "turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday" and she blamed "the right wing" for his new strategy. 
<LI><a href="#soft">Dole's intentions are scrutinized on Today, but Al Gore gets a softball interview</a> that began with this challenging question: "Many can see that you have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in our history."

</OL>
<P>
<a name="bozo">
<B>1)</B> On Tuesday a man in a crowd yelled at Dole "Please
get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on
his way out." But to believe some media reports you'd think
Dole set out Tuesday to launch a new campaign strategy based
upon insulting Clinton. 
<P>
Here's the headline in the Wednesday, October 9 Boston
Globe: <I>"Dole Goes On Attack, Calls Clinton 'Bozo.'"</i> The
subhead: <I>"Comment Draws White House Retort."</I> 
<P>
USA Today's headline declared: <I>"Dole Quips That He'll
Beat 'Bozo.'"</I> The lead of Judy Keen's story: <I>"Bob Dole
politely called his rival 'Mr. President' during Sunday's
presidential debate. But on Tuesday, he referred to him as
'Bozo.'"</I>
<P>
On Wednesday morning's Today Katie Couric talked with
Tim Russert. Here's part of their discussion, as transcribed
by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens: 
<BR>
<DD>Couric: "Let me just turn to the presidential campaign
very quickly. As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly
nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a
moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President
Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being
President. You heard that bozo exchange. Effective strategy
or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "I don't think it's an effective strategy.
I was rather surprised. I think Senator Dole was very
effective Sunday night in raising his favorable rating with
the American people. He didn't move many votes but at least
he was looked at in a much more favorable light with his
sense of humor and quickness."
<BR>
<DD>Katie Couric: "But the right wing thought he wasn't
aggressive enough?"
<BR>
<DD>Tim Russert: "Well obviously he's responding to that
criticism and what he's saying is, 'My God, I haven't
reached 40 percent in the polls yet! I have 20 percent of
the Republican party still not voting for me. The only way
to get to them is by being more aggressive and negative on
Clinton.' The problem is Katie when you do that, what you do
is say to a large amount of women, the so-called gender gap,
they don't like that. And they have said repeatedly they
want a more positive campaign. It's a very risky, very risky
venture by Senator Dole."
<P>
<a name="soft">
<B>2)</B> Meanwhile, Al Gore gets a little nicer treatment.
Later on Wednesday, Today aired an interview with the Vice
President caught by MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens. Here are
all the "questions" posed by Ed Gordon (a frequent host of
MSNBC's InterNight).
<P>
<DD>-- "Many can see that you have indeed been the most
powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with
the role that you played for four years?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "The debate is coming up. What do you want people to
come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What
should they know about Al Gore?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Biggest difference between you and Jack Kemp?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're
there to help the President. Now having said that, do you
want the job in 2000?"
<BR>
<DD>-- "Any concerns that you all are overconfident with the
lead that the polls show and is there any concern that
because the lead is so large you might not be able to use
your coattails to usher in people into the House and the
Senate?"
<P>
Five questions, but Gordon couldn't squeeze in an
inquiry about Al Gore's hypocritical tobacco speech at the
Democratic convention.
<P>
<a name="race">
<B>3)</B> Speaking of sucking up to the VP, ever since a pro-Bush
independent expenditure campaign in 1988 highlighted
the Dukakis furlough of Willie Horton, for the media
Horton symbolized how the GOP "plays the race card."
Conservatives regularly pointed out, to no avail, how Gore
first raised the issue in a 1988 primary debate.
<P>
But in a story for CNN's AllPolitics.com Web site two
CNN reporters on Tuesday cited Gore's question not as an
example of racial politics but as a sign of Gore's
toughness. MRC analyst Steve Kaminski noticed the following
sentence in a VP debate preview story by CNN reporters Marc
Watts and Bob Franken:
<P>
<DD>"Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as
a Senator, he first raised what became known as the 'Willie
Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary debate."
<P>
In a February 13, 1992 CNN special on race and the
campaign, MRC associate editor Tim Graham reminded me, Ken
Bode placed all the onus on the GOP: "David Duke's
exploitation of white working class fears about blacks
echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically
notorious convict in America. William Horton, Jr., the focal
point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the
readiness of political leaders to exploit the racial
divide."
<P>
<a name="engberg">
<B>4)</B> Monday's CBS Evening News (October 7) included a
"Reality Check" segment by Eric Engberg on facts asserted
during Sunday's debate. Here's a piece of the story:
<P>
<DD>Eric Engberg: "Some facts got mangled."<BR>
<DD>Dole: "For the first time in history, you pay about 40
percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food,
clothing and shelter combined, for taxes under this
administration."<BR>
<DD>Engberg: "Exaggeration. The most recent government study
says the average household spends $16,000 on the basics, and
only $6,000 on all taxes, including state and local taxes
outside the President's control."<BR>
<P>
As Engberg would say, TIME OUT! On Tuesday the Tax
Foundation released a report showing Dole was correct and
Engberg was wrong. The Tax Foundation discovered that the
government report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
"greatly understates taxes paid....Among the omissions, the
survey does not list the employee's share of Social Security
tax payments among taxes paid....Similarly, the BLS survey
does not report sales and excise taxes paid....Just as
important, the BLS survey results altogether ignore the
effect of indirect levies, such as business taxes, on
American households."
<P>
Factoring in all these taxes, the Tax Foundation
calculated that for households from $22,500 to $750,000
plus, taxes took a larger bite than the total for food,
clothing, and housing. The Tax Foundation found that
households in the $45,000 to $60,0000 category spent $16,000
as Engberg said on "the basics," but had a $25,000 tax burden. 
<P>
We need a Reality Check for the CBS Reality Check.

<a name="Dole">
<FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT>) On Tuesday night (October 8) ABC's World News Tonight
and NBC Nightly News aired stories on the big spending by labor
unions to defeat freshmen Republicans. The CBS Evening News and
ABC's World News Tonight featured pieces with clips of their
correspondent interviewing Bob Dole on his bus.
<BR>
<DD>
The big news of the day: Bozo. A man in a crowd yelled at
Dole that he should get bozo out of the White House. Dole shot
back: "Bozo's on his way out."
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw opened Inside Politics: "Was he borrowing
the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole
lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill
Clinton?"
<P>
On World News Tonight, ABC's John Cochran began his piece:
"Under pressure from critics in his own party to get personal
with the President, today Dole said he's ready to do just that.
In a series of interviews Dole admitted he was too soft on the
President in their first debate, especially on White House access
to FBI files on well-known Republicans...."
<P>
Noting that Dole failed to demand that Clinton promise not
the pardon those involved in Whitewater, Cochran ran a clip of
Dole explaining: "It would seem to me, particularly in the first
debate, when there's this myth out there about the mean Bob Dole,
if I'd done anything that even appeared to be stepping over the
line, that would have been the story."
<P>
Cochran continued: "That was exactly what happened today when
a supporter asked Dole to please get the bozo out of the White
House. Dole said bozo's on his way out."
<P>
Of course, Cochran made it the story. He didn't have to. The
CBS Evening News didn't mention the exchange.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="FBI">
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2</FONT>) Cochran didn't use Dole's admission that he went too
easy on Clinton on the FBI files as an opportunity to report how
an aide to Craig Livingstone had contradicted his story. But he's
not the only reporter with an aversion to Clinton scandals. On
Monday's This Morning (October 7) Mark McEwen discussed the
debate with Bob Beckel and Fred Barnes. McEwen told Barnes:
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night."

<FONT SIZE=+2>3</FONT>) NBC's Today has also failed to report anything on the
deposition from Craig Livingstone's aide (see October 6
CyberAlert for details). But, on Tuesday morning Today's Matt
Lauer repeatedly pressed Newt Gingrich about his ethics case. 
<BR>
<DD>
Lauer asked Gingrich seven questions about the debate and why
he's so unpopular, then fired six questions about Gingrich and
the ethics committee. Here are the last six question posed by
Lauer in his October 8 interview with Gingrich:

<blockquote> "Are you completely sure, Mr. Speaker, that you have been
completely forthright and truthful in providing information to
this committee?"<BR>
<DD>"But wouldn't it seem somewhat obvious that there must be
something that's disturbing or distressing them completely. Why
would Republicans, on the subcommittee, vote to expand the
investigation if they haven't found something that disturbs even
them?"<BR>
<DD>"But can you think of a logical reason why they would do
that?"<BR>
<DD>"Do you envision any circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under
which you might be forced to resign based on this investigation?"<BR>
<DD>"So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt
Gingrich was not truthful with us in supplying information?"<BR>
<DD>Gingrich: "I don't think they can say that."<BR>
<DD> "If they did, would you consider resigning?"<BR>

with Elizabeth Dole. One of Couric's questions:
<blockquote>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for a
Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures, in
the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?"

Maybe he's just paying the price for a biased media.

<Li> On Thursday the <a href="#nasty">Dole and Clinton</a> campaigns released new TV
ads. Guess which one NBC's Brian Williams labeled "nasty." 
<LI>In front of cameras in the Senate press conference facility on
Friday, Senator <a href="#orrin">Orrin Hatch </a> released the deposition of a former
aide to Craig Livingstone. She said the FBI files were not
obtained by mistake and that there are pages missing from the log
tracking who looked at the files. Network coverage: Zilch.
<LI> The Wall Street Journal's <a href="#al">Al Hunt</a> spews some mean-spirited
venom, tagging a former Republican presidential candidate a
"hatemonger" (and it's not Pat Buchanan), calls one current U.S. 
Senate candidate an "extremist" while saying another symbolizes 
"hate." Special bonus: he trashes Kenneth Starr.

On Friday night's (October 4) CBS Evening News, reporter
Phil Jones explained what Dole has to do in the debate: "He's got
to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15 percent tax cut,
can be paid for without draconian cuts in social programs. He
wants to talk about the character issue, but he can't get
personal or look mean-spirited doing it."
<P>
    Avoiding a media tag of being mean-spirited will be pretty
tough. Just look at Thursday night's (October 3) The News with
Brian Williams on MSNBC.
 <P>   Williams announced: "We're going to take a look at the new
political ads that are out tonight. There are two of them. We're
going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which
takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory. Here it is now
in its entirety."
<P>
<DD>    And here's the "nasty" ad:
<P>
<blockquote>Dole ad narrator: "How to speak liberal."<BR>
Clinton video: "I can tell you this. I will not raise taxes on
the middle class to pay for these programs."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes right on the middle
class. How to speak more liberal."<BR>
Clinton: "People in this room still mad at me for that budget<BR>
because you think I raised your taxes too much."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised taxes even on Social
Security."<BR>
Clinton: "It might surprise you to know that I think I raised
them too much too."<BR>
Narrator: "That's liberal for I raised your taxes and got
caught."<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
    Disjointed maybe, but nasty? Williams continued: "President 
Clinton is firing back with a new ad touting his achievements in 
office and once again tying Bob Dole to House Speaker Newt Gingrich."
<P>
    MSNBC showed the non-nasty ad which is all in color, except
for the video of Dole and Gingrich which is in black and white:
<P>
<blockquote>
Clinton ad narrator over video of scenes matching the text:
"Imagine. It's 11pm and you know where your kids are. At home.
President Clinton supports curfews so children are home and safe.
School uniforms to instill discipline. Ban cigarette ads aimed at
our children. Require teenage mothers to stay in school or lose
welfare.
<P> 
[black and white video of Dole next to Gingrich]: Dole and
Gingrich tried to slash school anti-drug programs. They'd take us
back.
<P>
[video in color of Clinton strolling under trees]: President
Clinton is looking forward. Helping parents to teach children
responsibility, protecting our values."

The front page headline in the Saturday, October 5
Washington Times declared: "Livingstone Lied on 'Filegate,' Ex-Aide 
Implies." The Washington Post also made the news its lead
story: "White House Contradicted on FBI Files: Ex-Aide Tells
Panel Staff Knew of Checks on GOP Officials." The Los Angeles
Times ran a story inside, but Saturday's New York Times had not a
word.
<P>
    Having watched all three broadcast network evening shows
Friday night, this was news to me. ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News and the NBC Nightly News did not mention the
development.(CNN's The World Today co-anchor Linden Soles did do a
brief item on it with a soundbite from Hatch.) What did TV
viewers miss?
<P>    
Here's the opening of Post reporter George Lardner's story:
<blockquote>"A former executive assistant in the White House security office,
contradicting accounts by her old boss and co-workers, told
Senate investigators this week that 'everybody in the office
knew' in the fall of 1993 that they were obtaining FBI files on
'people who were no longer working there.'
"The aide, Mari Anderson, an ex-Clinton-Gore campaign worker,
said they even joked about some prominent Republicans still listed
as current White House pass holders."</blockquote>
 <P>
   Later in the story:
<P>
<blockquote>"Asked about a six-month gap in the security office log
maintained to show who checked out files, Anderson said she was
confident some pages were missing from the copy the White House
provided the committee. She said she distinctly remembered making
checkout notations in the loose-leaf log during that six month
period, from March 29, 1994, to September 21, 1994."
</blockquote>
<P>
    Nixon only "accidently erased" 18 minutes. 
<P>
   So, did the front page treatment in both of Washington's
newspapers prompt network interest? No. NBC's Today on Saturday
didn't mention the news, but did find time to report that the
maker of M&Ms is test marketing 18 new colors. Saturday night,
ABC and CBS evening shows were bumped by college football in DC,
but NBC Nightly News aired nothing.  
<P>
    Minutes later on CNN's Capital Gang National Review's Kate
O'Beirne made the revelations her Outrage of the Week, observing:
"It remains to be seen if this prompts the outrage from the
people in the press is so richly deserves."
<P>
    Not so far. Sunday morning Sam Donaldson at least did ask
This Week with David Brinkley guest Leon Panetta a question about
it.
<P>
<BR>
    UPDATE 1: Last week I reported that none of the broadcast
networks reported the September 25 revelation of the six month
gap in the log. MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens has let me know that
CNN's The World Today (10pm ET) did air a whole piece that night
by Bob Franken.
<P>
    UPDATE 2: Last week I also reported that the networks failed
to note the FDIC report on how Hillary Clinton had deceived them.
Well, Friday night, a week and a half after the report made The
Washington Post's front page, it made NBC Nightly News, but only
through the hook of a chance to disparage Kenneth Starr for
speaking Friday at Regent University. 
 <P>
   NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reported: "Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic
Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White
House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for
political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
    Miklaszewski went on to summarize the status of Starr's
inquiry into the First Lady. Miklaszewski described the
FDIC report and aired the White House rebuttal.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>3)</FONT>
 On Saturday's Capital Gang (October 5) on CNN, Al Hunt,
Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor, was full of
hate. 
<P>
<blockquote>    -- "I think North Carolina is a test in the great divide in
the Republican conservative movement. There's the politics of
hope personified by Jack Kemp and there's the politics of hate
personified by Jesse Helms."<P>
    -- On Louisiana where Democrat Landrieu faces Republican
Jenkins: "In Louisiana, I think, Mary Landrieu is a bad
candidate, but she's going to win for three reasons. Woody
Jenkins is an extremist, Bill Clinton's going to carry Louisiana
and Newt Gingrich has scared those African-Americans. There'll be
a big black turnout."<P>
    -- His Outrage of the Week: "Kenneth Starr, the supposedly
non-partisan independent counsel investigating the Clintons, was
the featured speaker yesterday at a luncheon sponsored by right
wing hatemonger Pat Robertson, *whose Christian Broadcasting
Network and Regent Law School*. By pandering to Clinton-haters,
Mr. Starr appears to be abandoning all pretenses of impartiality.
He went into this job with a reputation as a fair-minded
conservative. He now looks more like a political hit man
desperately eager for a future Supreme Court appointment." 
    [* There is a word missing, but that's what he said.]

"softly."

feels free to interrupt him."
<LI>The <a href="#october">October 7</a> edition of Notable Quotables. If you make it

ABC <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced<BR>
Thursday night (October 3): 
<P>    "For days President Clinton has been dominating the news with
his efforts to ease the crisis between Israel and the
Palestinians. Today, Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage
with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's
work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy. Senator
Dole called the past three years rudderless and illusionary. He
claimed the President has squandered American power. The
administration has so far answered softly, but says there is more
to come."
<P>
    Reporter John Cochran went on the tag the speech as
"scathing." He reported: "In a scathing critique of Clinton
foreign policy, Dole rolled off a long list of what he called
failures, going back to the 1993 effort to restore order in
Somalia."
<P>
    What was the administration's response that earned Sawyer's
"soft" description? CBS and NBC viewers heard Press Secretary
Mike McCurry's retort. He played off Spiro Agnew's "nattering
nabobs of negativism" line (not generally considered "soft") and
asserted that Dole foreign policy advisers are "nattering
naysayers of gloom." ABC didn't show viewers McCurry's soundbite.
<P>
    On NBC Nightly News, David Bloom also used the term "harsh"
to describe Dole's speech: "It was Dole's harshest critique yet
of what he called Clinton's failed foreign policy." But a bit
later in his story Bloom put the tone in a better light, noting
that "After reviewing his speech over breakfast with retired
General Colin Powell, Dole chose his words carefully. His tone
was measured. He was playing politics, but he wanted to appear
presidential."
<P>
<BR>
<a name="gore">
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>2)</FONT>
CBS reporter Rita Braver profiled Al Gore Thursday
night. Her October 3 Evening News piece included this rather
bizarre sequence: 
<blockquote>Braver: "He's in on every key White House meeting and
decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore
convinced the President to create a controversial national
monument in Utah. Of late, Republican have attacked him for making
a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer
caused by smoking."<BR>
Gore at Democratic convention: "It hurt very badly to watch her
savaged by that terrible disease."<BR>
Braver: "While for several years after her death he let tobacco
be grown on land he owned. Gore dismisses that attack as
politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he
feels free to interrupt him."<BR>
Gore, going to microphone in front of Clinton: "Could I add a
word since..."<BR>
Braver: "But above all Gore sees his job as making the President
look good. And he's been amply rewarded. It's no secret that if
Bill Clinton is re-elected he wants Al Gore to succeed him."
</blockquote>
<P>
    So, CBS acknowledges the whole premise of Gore's emotional
convention speech was a fraud, but it's wrong to even raise the
subject because he's so powerful he can cut in front of the
President at a podium.

away free candy. What's not to like? Everybody knows what happens
when you eat too much candy. You get cavities. You get sick. You
get fat. A big tax cut may feel good but it can cause
problems...`Candy?' Dole says. `No thank you,' the voters reply.
`We're feeling much better now and we don't want to get sick
again.' Dr. Dole and Dr. Kemp are supply-side specialists. They
have a revolutionary theory that says `Candy is good for you!
More tax cuts, more growth. More growth, more income.' Now what a

<LI><a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> wonders if OJ Simpson "will ever get a fair shake in this country?" It's one of several liberal questions on race he poses to Johnnie Cochran.
<LI><a href="#moderate">The newly moderate</a> President Clinton attends a fundraiser packed with aging 1960s lefties and Hollywood celebrities with animus toward Republicans. 
<LI><a href="#faithful">Incredibly, a major newspaper</a> says it was an error to report that Bill Clinton and Dick Morris have been unfaithful to their wives.
</OL>
<P>
<a name="gumbel">
<B>1) Wednesday's Today (October 2)</B> carried the third part of
Bryant Gumbel's interview with Johnnie Cochran. And as he did on
Monday, Gumbel again used the segment as an opportunity to
promote his liberal views on race.
<P>
<DD>Discussing how much media attention the first OJ trial
attracted, Bryant Gumbel asked: "Do you think if those two
victims had been, say, Marguerite, his first wife, and Al
Cowlings, his best friend, that there would have been the same
amount?"
<P>
<DD>Johnnie Cochran responded: "Absolutely not. And I think any
person who wants to be honest about it would say the same thing."<BR>
<DD>To which Gumbel shot back: "Why? Because America doesn't care
about black victims?"
<P>
<DD>After Cochran's reply, Gumbel inquired: "Most white Americans
still charge that OJ's jurors didn't do their job. You talk about
a rush to judgment. They would claim the same. They would claim
the verdict was race based. Do you think their judgment of those
jurors is race based?"
<P>
<DD>Then, after asking if the complicated case merited more
consideration that jury gave it in a few hour of deliberation, 
Gumbel wondered: "Do you think OJ will ever get a fair shake in
this country. Will people ever let him live out his life and
accept the fact that he was acquitted?"
<P>
<DD>Fair shake? He's a millionaire football player who
successfully led a second career as a sports commentator, actor
and commercial spokesman. He then murders two people but is found
not guilty. How unfair.
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<B>2) At Boston's Fleet Center Saturday night</B> the Democrats
and Senator John Kerry held a $2 million fundraiser starring
several celebrities.  
<P>
<DD>During the Democratic convention, NBC's Tom Brokaw insisted
that since 1992 Clinton and Gore "have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center." Keeping that assurance in
mind, here's a bit of Boston Globe reporter Michael Grunwald's
September 29 story on the event: "Peter, Paul and Mary played
'Blowin in the Wind,' even though President Clinton has been
accused of doing just that. In fact, the legendary folk trio even
played 'Puff the Magic Dragon' -- and the President clapped along,
war on drugs notwithstanding....It was a long, strange trip at
the Fleet Center last night, as a parade of lefty rockers and
folkies brought back a slice of 1960s culture for a 1990s audience." 
<P>
<DD>These 1960s activists were in attendance to praise the
President. The Washington Post reported on September 30: "Mary
Travers said peace, justice and equality are still what the fight
is all about, while [Don] Henley praised the President for
protecting the environment and exhorted the audience to elect a
Democratic Congress 'so that there will be trees to hug,'"
<P>
<DD>Current stars also attended as the Boston Herald's Ed Hayward
reported that comedienne/actress Whoopi Goldberg announced: "I'm
glad to see some good-looking people in office. The other party
seems to have taken some ugly pills."
<P>
<DD>Isn't that the kind of language the media deem "nasty" when
uttered by a conservative?
<P>
<a name="faithful">
<B>3) The Internet Guild's Steve Allen caught this gem</B> while
doing a Nexis search. Under the "corrections and clarifications"
heading the September 5 Chicago Tribune corrected syndicated
columnist Linda Bowles: 
<P>
<DD>"In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated
that President Clinton and his former campaign adviser Dick
Morris both were 'guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives
and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven to
have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error." 
<P>
<DD>So, this is an "error" but reporting "slashes" in Medicare or
school lunches is just solid reporting.

<LI><a href="#20/20"> To Hugh Downs on 20/20</a> Friday night, it's Hillary the world's most persecuted First Lady. And Barbara Walters comes at Bill Clinton from the left, charging the welfare bill was "too extreme."
<LI><a href="#headlines">You can't always trust what you read.</a> A local example of conflicting headlines based on the same facts. 
<LI><a href="#text">The text of the September 23</a> edition of Notable Quotables. Most of the quotes have not been in any CyberAlert messages. Among the quotes, the New York Times says the Republican Party has been "a vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the Goldwater campaign..." Plus, Time and Newsweek slobber over Al Gore.
</OL>
<a name="20/20">
<B>1) On Friday night (September 20) ABC's 20/20</B><BR> ran Barbara
Walters' interview with the Clintons. Introducing the second segment,
co-host Hugh Downs announced: 
<P>
<DD>    "She is, perhaps, the most criticized, the most scrutinized,
First Lady in history. Everyone has an opinion about Hillary Clinton,
and Mrs. Clinton has heard them all. How has her marriage changed in
these four years? What are her concerns now, both personal and political?
Barbara continues now with the President and the First Lady, the world's
most powerful couple."
<P>
<DD>    During that segment, Bill Clinton said he might have Hillary
work on welfare reform during his second term, a suggestion that he
may scale back welfare reform to please liberals. But instead of pursuing 
the possibility that his signature was nothing more than election-year
positioning, in the next segment Walters asked him:
<P>
<DD>"Even your own aides, many of them, and advisers feel that the bill 
is too extreme. Two of your advisers recently quit. Under the new bill a
60 year old federal guarantee of aid to needy families will end. It's
been estimated as many as a million children will go hungry. What are
you going to do about that?"
<P>
<a name="headlines">
<B>2) In the Virginia Senate race,</B><BR> incumbent Republican John
 Warner faces Democratic challenger Mark Warner. Having both
candidates share a last name isn't the only confusing part about
following the race. Just look at these two headlines from
September 19 on a Mason-Dixon poll showing the Republican Warner
leading 54 to 34 percent.

<I>-- Some of Bryant Gumbel's questions to former Clinton business partner and convicted felon Susan McDougal and her attorney, September 17 Today.</I>
<P>
<B>Mistake to Talk to Conservatives; Mistake Not to Talk to Liberals</B><BR>
"Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian
Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the
religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing
voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes
to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich
team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, in
reinvigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign
official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him
thanks for me.'"<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's David Bloom, September 14 Nightly News.</I>
<P>
<CENTER><I>vs.</I></CENTER>
<P>
"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd [at the NAACP convention].
That comes as no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to
speak at the convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he
was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and
an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here,
Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines
and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this
presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."<BR>
<DD><I>-- NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, July 10 Nightly News. </I>
<P>
<B>Fallows' Hillary Fan Club Application</B><BR>
"Is Hillary Clinton's predicament worse because she is a woman?
Probably so. From Primary Colors to Rush Limbaugh to Saturday
Night Live, the hostile stereotype of Hillary is the domineering
ice-woman, the one person who scares the Most Powerful Man in
the World. Bill Clinton has suffered when judged on the age-old
standard of masculinity: military service. But female observers,
from Camille Paglia to Maureen Dowd, have judged Hillary with a
catty ferocity they would not apply to men. A man with a prim
exterior can get into trouble, too, as Jimmy Carter could
testify, but he mainly risks being seen as a weakling. Such a
woman is an emasculating schemer." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New U.S. News & World
Report Editor James Fallows in an essay titled "She's Lois Lane"
in the September/October Mirabella magazine.</I>
<P>
<B>Ad Says Dole Opposes Time Off While Your Kid Dies: I Loved It!</B><BR>
"That family leave ad was right on the mark. You know, it
absolutely escapes me how somebody can be for family values and
yet be willing to deny a father the opportunity to spend time
with a critically ill child or a mother time with a newborn
without fear of losing their job." <BR><DD><I>-- Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt on the Clinton campaign's negative ads, CNN's Capital Gang, September 14.</I>
<P>
<B>Intensely Competitive Puff Pieces About Gore</B><BR>
"George Bush fumed about jokes that he had put his manhood in a
blind trust to serve as Ronald Reagan's Vice President. The
young Dan Quayle never convinced the country he had the gravitas
to be Veep, let alone top man. But the cerebral, private,
intensely competitive Al Gore has managed the contortionist's
feat of projecting an almost perfect loyalty to his boss's
re-election without diminishing himself...Gore and Clinton, both
brainy, moderate Southerners with an abiding interest in the
plumbing of government, speak an easy shorthand and razz each
other like competitive brothers." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter J.F.O. McAllister, September 2.</I>
<P>
"Though Al Gore relishes politics almost as much as his boss
does, tonight he is next door in the Old Executive Office
Building, doing what he really loves: thinking about complexity
theory, open systems, Goethe and the absence of scientific
metaphors in modern society. He's writing a speech, and the
elegant Ceremonial Office is strewn with pizza cartons and Diet
Coke cans...Clinton may lead the country into the millennium,
but it is Gore who truly embodies the new century's
possibilities and anxieties."<BR>
<DD><I> -- Newsweek reporter Bill Turque, September 2.</I>
<P>
<B>As Opposed to Those Pro-Civil Rights Southern Democrats</B><BR>
"But most important is the Republican Party's recent record as
the vehicle of white supremacy in the South, beginning with the
Goldwater campaign and reaching its apex in Richard M. Nixon's
`Southern Strategy' in 1968 and 1972. Republicans appealed to
Nixon Democrats (later Reagan Democrats) in the northern
suburbs, many of them ethnic voters who had left the cities to
escape from blacks, with promises to crack down on welfare
cheats and to impose law and order, and they fought against
affirmative action." <BR>
<DD><I>-- New York Times Washington Bureau Chief
R.W. Apple on why the Dole-Kemp ticket isn't attracting black
support, September 19.</I>
<P>
<B>Clinton Makes Life Great, Dole Makes It Worse</B><BR>
"For most people in this country, life is awfully good. So
Clinton doesn't need to raise any issues. He just needs to point
to his record and promise more of the same. The people who don't
have a great life right now -- the 39 million people below the
poverty level, the 40 million people with no health insurance,
the 6.2 million people earning at or below the minimum wage --
are the people who really do have the issues. But Dole isn't
about to reach out to them, and they aren't about to vote for
Dole or the Republicans. That would make their plight worse, if
that's possible."<BR><DD><I> -- Former NBC News President Michael Gartner
in his USA Today column, September 17.</I>
<P>
<B>So What If the Tax Burden's At A Historic High?</B><BR>

tax cuts at all?"<BR>
<DD><I>-- Time Washington reporter Michael Duffy to
Alan Murray on PBS's Washington Week in Review, September 6.</I>
<P>
<B>The Media Encouraged Newt's Extremism</B><BR>
"The media's preoccupation with conflict in general deeply
affects the behavior of politicians, especially in Congress. An
ambitious politician knows that the sure way to command press
attention is with sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt
Gingrich built his power with media fireworks." <BR>
<DD><I>-- Former New York Times reporter Hedrick Smith narrating his PBS special
People and the Power Game, September 3.</I>
<P>
<B>Bigoted Bonnie</B><BR>
"TV viewers saw a well-orchestrated image of a moderated
Republican Party, portraying itself as pro-woman,
pro-minorities, and pro-tolerance. This is in sharp contrast to
the delegates on the floor, sixty percent of whom
self-identified as conservative Christians." <BR>

<a name="networks">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Last week</FONT> I reported that the network evening shows had
failed to mention a FDIC report which concluded that Hillary
Clinton had drafted a real estate document meant to "deceive"
federal regulators. The FDIC report was released last Monday,
September 23. Through Monday night September 30 it had yet to
generate a mention on any of the broadcast networks.
<P>
<I>What else went unreported on network evening shows last week:</I>
-- On Tuesday, September 24 a House committee held hearing on
how the Clinton Administration let criminals become citizens. The
Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers
yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight
subcommittee of  rampant' abuses in the Citizenship USA program
that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records
become citizens."
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- On Wednesday, September 25. Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a
six month gap in the log listing who at the White House accessed
the FBI background files. The Washington Times bannered the news
across page one the next day.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting.</I>
<P>
-- also on Wednesday, The Washington Times reported that U.S.
Rep. John Mica had sent a letter to Clinton's drug czar demanding
release of a four month old Institute for Defense Analysis report
that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective
than Clinton's drug treatment emphasis. Just 9 percent of
Clinton's drug budget goes to interdiction.
<I>Network evening show coverage: Still waiting, but drug czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to respond at an October 1 House hearing.</I>
<P>
-- On Thursday, September 26, 170 members of Congress send a
letter to Clinton asking that he promise not to pardon any
Whitewater figures. In an interview last Monday on the PBS
NewsHour Clinton had said he thought Kenneth Starr was out to get
him and the President defended Susan McDougal's decision to
refuse to testify. The Sunday Washington Times had a story which
began: "House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government
if Republican demanded a vote on a resolution calling for
President Clinton not to pardon key Whitewater figures, Rep.
Spencer Bachus said yesterday."
<I>Network evening show coverage: One question from anchor John Roberts to analyst Laura Ingraham on the Sept. 29 CBS Evening News.</I>
<P>
What did they cover? Between last Thursday and Sunday each of
the network evening shows aired two stories on Newt Gingrich's
dealings with the House ethics committee. And on Sunday's Today,
co-host Jodie Applegate couldn't quite get her history correct,
asking Gingrich Press Secretary Tony Blankley:
    "Mr. Blankley, it was seven years ago that Newt Gingrich
called on Jim Wright, who was then the Speaker of the House, to
step aside because an investigation had begun into his affairs."
<P>
<I>Of course the investigation had more than "begun."</I>
<P>
<a name="headline">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) The House</FONT> wrapped up its work over the weekend. Monday's
USA Today headline over a page A13 story reviewing the session
under GOP control read: "A Lean, Some Say Mean, GOP Machine."
<P>
<a name="acceptance">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) Another sign</FONT> of positive progress: On the September 28
Saturday Night Live guest host Tom Hanks played Peter Jennings in
skit in which Jennings interviews Clinton, Dole and Perot. 
<BR><DD>Here's Tom Hanks as Peter Jennings: "Mr. President, we here
at ABC News are not in the business of making endorsements, but
everyone here is voting for Bill Clinton and I personally cannot
imagine how any decent person would not, in fact, do the same. In
light of this, which of your many achievements do you feel
important to emphasize as we head toward the election?"
<P>
<I>It's hard to tell parody from reality.</I>
<P>
<a name="clinton">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>4) Friday's Washington Post</FONT> "In the Loop" column relayed:
"Scuttlebutt at the Voice of America has it that former U.S. News
& World Report political reporter Steven Roberts is being wooed
to replace outgoing VOA director Geoffrey Cowan." New U.S. News
Editor James Fallows asked Roberts to step down a few weeks ago,
but the Post reported that "The VOA was thinking about Roberts
before new U.S. News boss James Fallows began the purge."
<P>
<a name="yes">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>5) On Monday's (Sept. 30) Today,</FONT> Bryant Gumbel began day
one of a three day series with Johnnie Cochran. While Gumbel did
ask about OJ's alibi and how even if the Los Angeles police
botched the investigation and employ racist, that it's hard to
believe a conspiracy, he also posed these two questions:
    "Comments that he has made to others would seem to indicate a
certain degree of, and not unjustifiably, a certain degree of
anger, bitterness. Has he expressed that to you?"
    "Why do you suppose it is that one year after his acquittal,
most white Americans at least, cannot accept the idea that he's
out walking around free, refuse to let him live his life?"
<P>
<I>Hmmm? Could it be that not everyone is happy that he got away with murder?</I>

<LI><a href="#abc">ABC's World News Tonight</a>, which didn't report poverty and

<a name="abc">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Bad news is news, not good news. Right?</FONT> Not at ABC when
the good news benefits Clinton.
<P>
    On October 6, 1994 the Census Bureau reported poverty had
risen to a three-decade high. ABC's World News Tonight: No story.
On October 5, 1995 the bureau reported a slight drop in poverty,
but the gap between richest and poorest grew. ABC's World News
Tonight: No story.
<P>
    On September 26, 1996 the Census bureau reports median income
up and poverty down. ABC's World News Tonight: Big story
crediting Bill Clinton.
<P>
    Peter Jennings opened the show Thursday night: "On World News
Tonight this Thursday, a bloody day between Israelis and
Palestinians. The Census Bureau says that Americans are earning
more for the first time in six years. Family income is up."
<P>
    Barry Serafin reported in his story that median household
income was up 2.7 percent, but still lower than 1989. Serafin's
story continued:
<BR><DD>"The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4
million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than
the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped
to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent. What does it add up
to?"
<BR><DD>Professor Frank Levy, MIT: "Things are slowly getting better and
the people feel OK about it. It's not nirvana, but it's certainly
not doom and gloom either."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "And there was certainly no gloom and doom at the White
House where the President pounced on the new figures."
Clinton: "The news is remarkably good, and I'd like to share it
with you."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Citing the income gains the President declared that the
country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans"
<BR><DD>Clinton: "We have had the largest decline in the inequality of
incomes in America in 27 years."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "Census Bureau officials, however, said that decline was
so small it was statistically insignificant. Still, there was
praise for today's generally upbeat report."
<BR><DD>Levy: "Well I think the credit is shared between the President
and Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve."
<BR><DD>Serafin: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good day for
Bill Clinton."
<P>
<DD>The New York Times reported June 30 that "the share of
national income earned by the top 5 percent of households grew at
a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan
administration, which was often characterized as favoring the
rich." ABC's World News Tonight that night: No story.
<P>
<DD>Immediately following Serafain, Jim Wooten reported on Bob
Dole in Florida. Wooten noted that Dole correctly pointed out
that poverty rose in Florida, then reported: "Still, the Senator
had much less to say about the numbers than about a President he
says is lying to older Americans, telling them Republicans will
cut Medicare, trying to frighten them into voting Democratic."
<BR><DD>Following a Dole soundbite, Wooten continued: "Then Senator
Dole tried to raise a bit of fear himself about Mr. Clinton's
plans for a second term."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He'll raise taxes again on the America people if he's re-elected."
Wooten: "The Senator insists that his principle campaign themes -- his 
bad news message about a limping economy, stagnate wages, high taxes 
and heavy deficits -- will eventually change the shape of this election. 
So far they haven't, but he keeps trying."
<P>
<DD>They might have a better chance if ABC weren't endorsing Clinton's 
claims while countering Dole's by saying he's also employing fear. 
<P>
<a name="what">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) On the September 25 Inside Politics</FONT> CNN's Bernie Shaw
took up the Dole charge that Clinton is really a liberal. To put
Shaw's question in context, here's how the exchange went with
Republican strategist Charlie Black and Democratic strategist
Frank Greer:
<BR><DD>Charlie Black: "People don't mind name calling if you call them
conservatives, which is what Bob Dole is. Teenage drug use has
doubled because Bill Clinton reduced the size of the White House
drug office 83 percent. How can you say he's had a good record on
drugs? Bernie, here's the problem. Bill Clinton wants the federal
government to run your life. He wants to take more and more of
your hard-earned money and then he wants to reward you a tax
credit if you behave the way he wants you to behave."
<BR><DD>Frank Greer: "It's the same worn-out rhetoric that they tried to
use in Congress and it didn't work."
<BR><DD>Bernard Shaw: "I understand the desire to talk about issues. I
understand that. A very innocent question. What's wrong with
being a liberal?"

Arizona electorate.
<LI>The Weekly Standard discovers that President Clinton hired his
<a href="#speech">speechwriter </a> from U.S. News & World Report because Clinton liked
how the journalist covered his 1992 campaign. That reporter now

<H3> 1)</H3> On Tuesday night's (September 17) World News Tonight, ABC's
Jim Wooten reported from Arizona on Bob Dole's campaign. Wooten 
asserted:<P>

<DD>"It's one measure of Senator Dole's problems that he even feels it 
<DD>necessary to campaign here in Arizona, Barry Goldwater's ultra-
<DD>conservative backyard. But the race is close here, quite close."
<P>
    Not "usually safe for Republicans," but "ultra-conservative." How
"ultra-conservative" exactly is Senator McCain? And if the state is so
"ultra-conservative" how could it possibly go for Clinton?

<H3>2)</H3> The September 23 Weekly Standard includes a profile of chief
White House speechwriter Donald Baer who had been Assistant Managing
Editor of U.S. News & World Report when he jumped to the Clinton team
in 1994. Writer Christopher Caldwell explained how Baer got his job:
<DD>    "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during
the 1992 campaign. While other journalists -- David Shribman of The
Wall Street Journal, Joe Klein of New York, Ron Brownstein of the Los
Angeles Times -- ignored the more sensational aspects of the campaign
for enthusiastic grapplings with 'Clintonism,' Baer wrote with extreme
empathy about Clinton's background.
 <DD>   "'I think it's a southern thing' says one of Baer's journalistic
colleagues, who also knows Clinton. 'Being of the South and still being
rooted there, yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself
in the larger world -- the two of them have a lot in common.' While
Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not necessarily a liberal.
Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism. This 
enthusiasm can appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. 
One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as 
'bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. 'Clinton was the moral 
leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"

<H3>    3) </H3>Last week the MRC released its study of prime time network
coverage of the party conventions. We found four times more extremist
labels were applied to Republicans as Democrats, but Democrats were
tagged liberal twice as often as Republicans were called conservative.
In addition, virtually all of the questions to both parties came from 
the left as the networks portrayed both the Republicans and Democrats
as too conservative. 

<DD>    Last week the Center for Media and Public Affairs also released
its study. CMPA examined not prime time but the ABC, CBS and NBC
evening newscasts during the two convention weeks. Some of their
findings:
<UL>
<LI> "Journalists continued to crowd out the politicians, taking
up 12 times as much airtime as the newsmakers. Reporters' comments
took up 75% of the speaking time in convention stories, compared
to only 6% for the four nominees. Other party officials and delegates
accounted for 10% of the airtime."
<LI>  Both parties' policies got even worse press than their 
candidates -- three to 1 negative overall. Five out of six sources 
(83%) criticized GOP policies, and two out of three (67%) rejected 
the Democrats' stands."
</UL>
<P>
    The Washington Post's John Carmody summarized the finding: 
"Comments on the two issues most talked about -- abortion during
the GOP meeting, welfare during the Democrats' -- suggested a 
left-liberal bent."

<LI>On Tuesday's Today show <a href="#gumbel"> Bryant Gumbel </a> interviewed Susan McDougal
from  jail in Arkansas. But instead of pressing her on why she
won't tell what she knows (for which she's been granted
immunity), Gumbel sympathized with her plight and portrayed her
as a victim of Republican politics. He asked: "Have you any doubt
that Kenneth Starr and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that
is purely political?"
<P>
<LI> CNBC cancels the <a href="#cal"> Cal Thomas </a> show, a decision Thomas says will
only fuel conservative feelings that the media are liberal.

1. Susan McDougal has already been found guilty of fraud
and been jailed for contempt of court for over a week for
refusing to answer questions about Bill Clinton's knowledge of
the fraudulent SBA loan deal. From the September 17 Today show,
here are some of Gumbel's questions to her, transcribed by MRC
intern Matt Turosz:
<P>
    Gumbel: Mrs. McDougal, let me start with you if I might. How
bad has confinement been there in Conway?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "How are you being treated by the authorities and the
other inmates?"
<P>
    Gumbel: "There are those who are obviously hoping that in
prison will prompt a change of heart on you part. Are you having
any second thoughts about refusing to answer questions?"
<P>
    Gumbel then posed his one and only tough question: "According
to reports, you were charged with contempt after being asked to
testify, about whether Bill Clinton knew about an illegal loan or
the purchase of a piece of property with some loan proceeds. Why
have you refused to answer that question?"
<P>
    McDougal responded by claiming Ken Starr had lied to her
before and failed to come through on a deal: "He used witnesses
against me with perjured testimony. Would you buy a used car from
this man. I certainly wouldn't go into a hearing without my
lawyer, into a grand jury room, and answer questions he asked me.
He has lied repeatedly. I won't deal with him."
<P>
    Instead of challenging her, Gumbel summarized her view: "So
basically you don't trust his promises of immunity from
prosecution in exchange for answers to his questions?"
<P>
    McDougal responded: "...He has lied about me. He has lied
during the trial. He has lied after the trial. And he has said
many times give us a proffer, something against the Clintons,
something that we can use, and we'll make all your problems go
away. Well, I'm sorry, that's just not how America works, and
that not how I want to deal with him."
<P>    
Gumbel next queried "Is there any amount of time in jail that
might make your either (A) change your mind or (B) have second
thoughts about trusting Mr. Starr and his deputies?"
<P>
    McDougal answered: "I told you earlier, I become stronger
everyday in my conviction everyday that I sit here."
<P>
    Gumbel then asserted: "Have you any doubt that Kenneth Starr
and his deputies are pursuing an agenda that is purely
political?"
<P>
    McDougal: "I don't believe anyone in America doubts it....I
want to know were I can go to complain about these people's evil
agenda to overrun me to get to the President."
<P>
    Gumbel took the same approach in talking to her lawyer:
"Bobby McDaniel, you said that your client is being used as
political pawn. Have you any legal recourse but to sit there and
watch this unfold?"
<P>
    A couple of questions later Gumbel returned to McDougal and
again bought her premise: "Given that you think this is all just
a Republican witch hunt, do you expect the pressure to ease
somewhat after the election?"
<P>

2. On Monday CNBC announced the cancellation of the weekend
interview shows hosted by Cal Thomas, Al Roker and Gerry Spence.
Thomas's last show (6:30pm and 1am ET Sat. and Sun.) will air in
early October. The Washington Post's John Carmody on Tuesday
quoted Thomas suggesting that the decision will "further the
already deep suspicion among conservatives that the news media is
overwhelmingly liberal."
<P>
    I'll let you know when Thomas finds another outlet and,
hopefully, a more prominent time slot.

<B>Dear MRC Member</B>,
<BR>
<P>
What happened to the conservative revolution we were all so excited about a year and a half ago? On Election Day 1994 the GOP captured both the House and the Senate, Clinton's socialized health care plan had been demolished, his agenda was in ruins. Most conservatives were celebrating the death of liberalism. 
<P><blockquote><I>I wasn't. I publicly warned that the conservative movement had no idea what was about to hit it.</I></blockquote>
<P>And did it ever. The left-wing press launched the most vicious, dishonest character 
assassination campaign I've ever seen. Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and others were vilified daily. The media flat out lied, thousands of times in 
fact, about the Contract with America, saying the "cuts" were going to put women and children, the poor and the elderly, on the streets -- hungry and naked. Clean air, clean water, our national parks -- everything was endangered. 
All because of those "tax cuts for the rich."
<P>You know I'm not exaggerating any of this.The left-wing press stopped at nothing in its attacks. Just look at how they accused the conservative talk radio community of responsibility for the greatest act of terrorism in U.S. history -- the Oklahoma City bombing. It defies belief.
<P>And look at the damage the liberal media caused. Today the Contract with America is 
in shambles. Newt Gingrich has the worst approval rating of any politician in America. And 
Bill Clinton -- considered politically dead one year ago -- is enjoying his highest ratings ever, and leading Bob Dole by 20 points according to some surveys.
<P><I><blockquote>The national press has turned much of America against our ideas by distorting 
everything we stand for. Theirs is an awesome power -- and they are using it.</blockquote></I>
<P>At a national press conference, which took place on June 5, I announced that the 
Media Research Center at <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> 
has launched the biggest political counterattack in history to stop these `60s-era elitists once and for all. 
<P>The MRC has been quietly working on our<B> "Tell the Truth!" </B>campaign for months, 
test-marketing it to conservative activists and voters each week. In the past few weeks my staff and I have been interviewed for ABC's <I>Nightline</I>, CNN's <I>Crossfire</I>, CBN's<I> 700 Club</I>, C-SPAN, CNBC, and many other national media outlets. 
<P>A powerful forum for the MRC is talk radio. In the past month, we've conducted over 50 radio interviews which have aired on hundreds of stations, and reached millions of voters. MRC spokesmen have appeared on nationally syndicated shows like the 
<I>G. Gordon Liddy Show</I>, the  <I>Ollie North Show</I>, and the <I>Michael Reagan Show.</I> And, when Rush Limbaugh invited me to host his radio show recently, I used it to show millions of Americans just how distorted the left-wing press has become.
<P>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. We are combining our sophisticated media 
research operation with advanced technology to produce the most comprehensive and 
creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal media.
<blockquote><I><P>The MRC <B>"Tell the Truth!"</B> campaign is hitting the liberal press in a way it's never been hit before. We have one message for the left-wing "news" media: Your days of 
unchecked bias are over. </I></blockquote>
<P>I am confident that this critically important campaign will end the media's non-stop 
attacks on conservatives, and put an end to their incessant support for Clinton and his ilk. Because of the urgency and importance of this campaign, your generous gift to the MRC is more vital than ever.<U> Thank you for helping us.</U>
<BR>

<p>
<H3>    Only one item today:</H3>
<P>       
<BR>
    Bill Clinton snubbed the Christian Coaltion conference over the weekend, 
but the media reacted a bit differently than when Bob Dole decided to not 
address the NAACP. 
<P> 
    Friday night none of the network evening news shows mentioned Clinton's
decision not to appear, though all did pieces on the conference. The issue
came up only on CNN's Inside Politics. In July, all the networks aired stories
about Dole not going to the NAACP convention. (Dole made a surprise appearance 
at the Christian Coalition meeting on Saturday and offered an introduction to
Jack Kemp who had been scheduled.) 
<P>
    Neither ABC or CBS had an evening newscast Saturday night on 
Washington stations because of college football, but NBC did not
get bumped for sports, so let's compare NBC's coverage.
<P>
On the July 10 NBC Nightly News, Jim Miklaszewski reported from the
NAACP gathering:
<P>    
<DD>"No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as no surprise to Bob 
Dole. Dole had been invited to speak at the convention yesterday, but declined.
He claimed he was already committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball 
game. To those at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<P>    
After explaining how the crowd was very anti-Republican, Miklaszewski
concluded his story: "By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those
racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans 
that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge."
<P>
On Saturday night's (September 14) NBC Nightly News, David Bloom 
reported:
<P>
<DD>    "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition 
despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might
send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters."
<P>
    Bloom concluded his story:
<P>
<DD>    "Clinton's campaign spokeman said in a statement 'watching Bob Dole arm 
in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued 
by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' Bob Dole tried, perhaps even succeeded today, 
in re-invigorating his Republican base. But a top Clinton campaign official 
was all smiles, saying, 'if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'"
<P>
    Anchor Brian Williams then announced: "The Christian Coaltion claims 
almost two million active members and is a potent political force in 31 states, 
but its voice is no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians. NBC's 
Bob Abernethy has our report."
<P>    Abernethy then began his bizarre story on "conservative" Christians:
<P>
<DD>"The Christian Coalition's organization, money and grassroots activism have 
made it one of the most important voices in the country for conservative values, 
especially opposition to abortion. The coalition's success has troubled other
Christians who agree with many of its objectives, but are uncomfortable with
its partisianship, and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its
neglect of the poor. One group of coalition critics is the Call to Renewal. 
It heard today from children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman."
<P>
    Abernethy went on to look at Jim Wallis of Sojourners, a left-wing 
crusade. He never got to any "conservative Christians."
<P>
 Let me summarize the differences in approach to one major candidate 
failing to appear at one of the conventions:
<P>
<OL>
    <LI> Dole's snub is big news. Clinton's is not.
    <LI> Dole's decision was "an insult to all African American voters." 
Clinton's was not an insult to all Christian-American voters.
    <LI> Dole's address to the Christian Coalition "might send the wrong message 
to moderate, swing voters." Clinton's appearance before the left-wing NAACP did 
not.
    <LI> Dole's speech prompted NBC to air a bizarre story citing only liberals 
about how the Christian Coalition does not represent all conservative Christians, 
many of whom are "troubled" by its policy views. Clinton's NAACP address did 
not prompt NBC to do a story on how the NAACP does not represent all liberal 
African-Americans or even all African-Americans, nor any consideration of how 
the NAACP's policies "trouble" anyone.
</OL>
<P>
    Tom Brokaw insisted at a June National Press Club appearnace: "We've 
worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do." Hard to tell.

ads were little more than character assassination. Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, 
ABC and CBS portrayed Dole as the villain who has dirtied the until now clean campaign. Only
NBC looked at Clinton's role. On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings announced: "The campaign for President took a 
nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out
at the Democrats for what he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the kindest 
thing Mr. Dole had to say." Reporter Jim Wooten showed clips of Dole complaining about Clinton and of Dole raising the medical records issue. Then he explained:
<P>
<DD>		"Press Secretary McCurry was asked by reporters today if the
		records would show indication of a number of diseases, including
		a sexually transmitted one. He said, no."
<P>
McCurry: "This has been put into play no doubt by those who seek to destroy the President. The President's physician reported on May 24th of this year he was in excellent overall health. Shecould not have done that if any of the allegations about diseases were true."
<P>
Wooten, concluding his piece: "It was bound to come to this no doubt as Senator Dole has been under considerable pressure from his campaign tacticians to begin attacking the President on
issues of personal character. So far he's resisted. Today may have been a signal that he's changing his mind."
<P>
  <DD><I>  So Dole's to blame for a reporter asking about a "sexually
transmitted" disease.</I>
<P>
    Then, Peter Jennings got to the second part of the how the campaign "took a nasty turn today" premise. Immediately after Wooten
finished he introduced the next story: "The President is going to
come under further Republican attack with the release next week
of the House Committee on Government Operations and Oversight's
report on the firings at the White House travel office."
  <P>  On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton
as victim theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole re-opened one of his
favorite lines of attack today about President Clinton's health
records. Phil Jones is our man with the Dole campaign, Phil."
Jones provided a very short piece which dealt only with the
medical records issue, and concluded: "Dan, this campaign is
headed exactly where everybody expected it to go: personal..."
  Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers what so upset
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for
a way to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is
taking off the gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
    Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative
television advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of
running a campaign of fear, of engaging in character
assassination."
    After a clip of Dole, Bloom continued: "At the Democratic
National Convention two weeks ago the President made this
pledge:"<P>
<BR>
<DD>Clinton: "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of
insults. The American people deserve it."
<DD>Bloom: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have
run only 42 positive ads with
<DD> 4,200 negative ads running across
the country."<BR>
<P>
Clips of Clinton ads, including: "If Dole sits here [Oval Office]
and Gingrich runs Congress what could happen. Medicare slashed. A
woman's right to choose gone."
  <P>
  Following another Dole soundbite of Dole and reaction from
the Clinton campaign, Bloom concluded: 
"Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget next
week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen
drug use, ads even tougher than this one."
Ad: "Bill Clinton said he'd lead the war on drugs and change
America. All he did was change his mind."
Bloom then ended his story by forwarding the "nasty" theme: "At a
Dole rally today the music blared 'get ready.' Get ready, that
is, for a very nasty campaign."

The Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press will be releasing the results of their survey of 1,508
people. Here are some of the more interesting findings:
<P>
<BR>
-- All in all, how would you rate the job the press has done
in covering the presidential campaign so far?
<P>
<DD>          44% Good
<DD>          29% Only fair
<DD>          13% Excellent
 <DD>         11% Poor
<P>
-- How much influence do you think news organizations have on
which candidate becomes President? (Posed only to the 1,141
registered voters in the sample)
<P>
<DD>          64% Too much
<DD>          30% About the right amount
<DD>           4% Too little
<P>
-- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bill Clinton's election campaign? (Again,
registered voters only, but this time sample of 565)
<P> 
 <DD>        67% Fair
     <DD>     24% Unfair
<P>
    -- Would you say the press has been fair or unfair in the way
it has covered Bob Dole's election campaign? (565 registered
voters)
<P>
       <DD>    65% Fair
<DD>           25% Unfair
<P>
    -- Who do you think most newspaper reporters and TV
journalists want to see win the presidential election -- Bill
Clinton, Bob Dole or Ross Perot? (Posed to sample size of 576)
<P>
         <DD>  59% Clinton
           <DD>17% Dole
<DD>            1% Perot
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
    So, the media are fair in coverage of both candidates, but the
public thinks that the media have too much influence on who wins and
perceives that reporters hope Clinton will win. Very confusing. --

<h4>Final Report on 1996 Television Network Convention Coverage:<br>

TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice as Often, But Fire Liberal
Questions<br>
Both Parties Too Conservative for the Networks</h4>
</center>

    Alexandria, VA -- The television networks substantially
increased the number of labels they applied to Democrats during
their 1996 convention over 1992, but at both the Republican and
Democratic conventions this year the networks demanded answers
to a barrage of questions from the left. For Republicans
gathered in San Diego, GOP intolerance on abortion was the
issue. For Democrats convened in Chicago, going too far to the
right on welfare reform became the media focus. Adding up both
questions and statements made by reporters to one another,
abortion or exclusion of pro-choice voices were raised as an
issue 55 times in San Diego, while viewers heard about welfare
reform 43 times in Chicago.<p>

    After producing a daily Media Reality Check '96 newsletter
during the August political conventions, the Media Research
Center's (MRC) news division staff organized its analysis of
prime time coverage into this special 15-page report. This
analysis covers ABC, CBS, CNN (starting at 8pm ET), NBC and the
joint NBC/PBS broadcast.<p> 

    <b>Key findings:</b><br>
<ul>
 <li>Democrats labeled liberal more often than Republicans tagged
conservative. Studies of the 1984, 1988 and 1992 conventions
found Republicans labeled much more frequently than Democrats.
In 1992, the MRC determined the networks applied 118
conservative labels during the GOP conclave, but just 38 liberal
labels during the Democratic gathering. This year, Republicans
were tagged 59 times (13 moderate, 30 conservative, and 16 more
extremist terms), but Democrats were labeled 119 times (44
moderate, 71 liberal and four more extremist terms).<p>

    In Chicago, Bill Clinton got 28 moderate labels and captured
about half as many liberal tags with 16. In San Diego, the
networks focused most of their labeling on conservative
delegates and speakers as Bob Dole went largely untagged --
three moderate and two conservative labels. The Republican
platform was never called moderate and the Democratic platform
was never described as liberal. See page 3 for a summary table
and graph, pages 6-14 for examples.<p>

<li>Convention attendees pummeled with questions from the left
side of the political spectrum. On 51 occasions in San Diego
Republicans were hit with questions from the left, especially
about intolerance and abortion, but they heard just six
inquiries from the right. Two weeks later instead of questioning
Democrats from the right, the networks posed 47 from the left,
the vast majority on how many Democrats opposed President
Clinton's decision to sign the welfare reform bill, but just 11
questions from the right. In this area the networks have grown
more biased. Four years ago, while the GOP got the same
treatment, hearing 131 questions from the left compared to 17
from the right, Democrats got a more even going over with 46
questions from the left and 38 from the right. See page 4 for a
table and graph, pages 7-15 for examples.<p>

<li>Republicans blamed repeatedly for displaying a negative
tone, but Democrats go unscathed despite some pretty vitriolic
speeches. In San Diego the networks characterized Republicans
with terms like "negative," "harsh," "strident" or "mean" or
described GOP speeches as an "attack," 34 times. Democrats were
hit with the negative descriptions just six times during their
convention, but even in Chicago Republicans got hammered more
with 23 references to GOP negativity. In 1992, the networks
questioned the Republican tone as too negative 70 times, but
never once raised the subject against Democrats at their
convention. See page 5 for a summary table and examples of the
contrast.<p>

<li>Controversies such as Whitewater and Travelgate barely
acknowledged. The Clintons are under active investigation by an
independent counsel, but the networks made only seven references
to Democratic scandals. NBC and the joint NBC-PBS broadcast
aired two mentions; ABC, CBS, and CNN, only one. Topics never
mentioned: the FBI files scandal, the Iran-Bosnia scandal, and
the special counsel investigations of Cabinet members such as
Henry Cisneros and Mike Espy. Controversies about Republicans,
such as questions about Elizabeth Dole's blind trust, were also
ignored.
</ul>

<center>
<h3><a name="best">Best</a> and Worst, from page 2 of the 15 page report:</h3>
</center>

<b>Best Network: ABC News </b><br>
    Posed the fewest ideological questions at both conventions,
had the least disparity in blaming the parties for being too
negative and, given the amount of airtime, were the most willing
to identify Democrats as liberal.<p>

<B>Worst Network: CNN</B><br>
    Failed to take advantage of their added airtime to offer
viewers something beyond just more of what the other networks
showed. CNN had the greatest disparity in the agenda of
questions posed, with 23 from the left to just three from the
right.<p>

<B>Best reporters</B><br>
<ul>
<li><B>Sam Donaldson, ABC News:</B> In San Diego he refrained from
gratuitous attacks on the Republicans for being too intolerant.
In Chicago, on the first day of the convention, Donaldson
offered a balanced appraisal of the party delegates, noting that
the Democratic delegates "are far to the left of the mainstream
just as the Republicans were to the right of the mainstream." In
the midst of hoopla over Bill Clinton's speech, only Donaldson
realized that while he gave a "great speech," the "record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind, trim it a little bit, do something else."<p>

 <li><B>Lisa Myers, NBC News: </B>One of the few reporters to pose
questions from both the left and right. In San Diego, she asked
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from the right about how she "has
generally opposed efforts to cut off benefits to illegal
immigrants, particularly education and health benefits. Why
would hardworking American taxpayers pay for people who are here
illegally?" Then she asked her about how people who saw her
speech "found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the
degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect, do
you think you went too far?" On the first night in Chicago,
Myers quizzed a delegate about whether liberals or New Democrats
control the party.<p> 

 <li><B>Brian Ross, ABC News:</B> Although CNN's Brooks Jackson appeared
early in prime time with stories on corporate contributions and
union influence, ABC's Ross deserves recognition despite the
fact his pieces did not air in prime time. In a series of World
News Tonight stories, Ross went after the big money contributors
to both parties. Ross raised unique issues, such as "the giant
media corporations...very much in the middle of the mix." In San
Diego he noted that "the ABC hospitality suite was a lobbyist's
dream." In Chicago he looked at one big donor: "His name is
Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a labor union the
FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia...has become one
of the Democrats' top money people."<p>
</ul>

<B>Worst reporters:</B><br>
<ul>
 <li><B>Maria Shriver, NBC News:</B>  Seemed baffled why a rape victim
would have anything to do with the GOP and her interview with
Hillary Clinton following the First Lady's address was more like
two old friends sharing tales of their suffering than a
dispassionate interview. Just after Jan Licence addressed
Republicans about victim's rights, Shriver asked her: "But why
[speak] at a Republican convention? So many people have said
that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
Shriver's interview with the First Lady assumed Mrs. Clinton had
been unfairly attacked by Republicans. Shriver posed questions
like, "This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did
that applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people
have been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" And,
noting GOP criticism of her book, Shriver wondered, "How did
that affect you when you heard about that?"<p>

<li><B>Judy Woodruff, CNN:</B> In San Diego she demanded that
Republicans explain why there weren't more female delegates, but
in Chicago instead of challenging Democrats on the appeal of
their pro-partial birth abortion stand, she worried about
welfare reform going too far. Woodruff peppered Mrs. Clinton
with six welfare questions, all from the left. She pleaded with
her to stop it: "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned
her again just now, said that much of the time she kept her
disagreements with the President to herself in private, but
there were times that she felt it was important to disagree
publicly. Does there ever come a time with you, and if not
welfare reform, then what?"<p>

<li><B>Tom Brokaw, NBC News:</B> Found Republican speakers threatened
to be perceived as too mean, took a pot shot at Ronald Reagan,
and portrayed Republicans as insensitive to rape, but praised
the speaking power of Democrats. In San Diego he warned that the
GOP knows "it has to lower the threshold of perceived meanness
on the part of the country." In Chicago, after Jesse Jackson's
speech which attacked conservatives, he admired how his words
grew "out of a very deep passion." Brokaw did at least mention
Whitewater in Chicago, but after the moving tribute to Ronald
Reagan in San Diego he took this swipe: "Ronald Reagan will have
to learn how history will judge his time in office -- the
deficits, the Iran-Contra affair." At the GOP conclave he told
rape victim Jan Licence: "This is a party that is dominated by
men," so, he wondered, "do you think before tonight they ever
thought about what happens in America with rape?"

<LI>
Why did Rep. Jim McDermott go through all the trouble of intercepting Republicans' phone calls with a scanner, when he could have just looked up the transcripts in their FBI files?
<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Spectators shivered, the choir sang ``Amazing Grace'' and ``America,'' and William Jefferson Clinton was sworn in at the nation's 53rd presidential inaugural. In a speech which, for all its brevity, was heavy with boilerplate, Mr. Clinton did enounce his political position. ``Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution. . . . We need a government humble enough not to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves.'' Possession-theories of his political success ignore his characteristic tropism toward a pragmatic-sounding centrism, a spot to the right of left. In practice, Clintonism may be as porous as a colander (what tools? what problems?). But the political counterarguments have to be made. If Clinton's enemies will not make them, they face a frustrating four years.


<P>
<hr>
<P>
<LI>When Congress passed the welfare bill last year, skeptics warned that Republican governors, chafing under the bill's work provisions and spending restraints, would become a major obstacle to its implementation. Sure enough, GOP governors led by George W. Bush (Tex.) are already agitating to reverse the bill's cutoff of Supplemental Security Income benefits for legal immigrants. Any backtracking on this provision would be a substantive and political disaster. There are now more aged non-citizens than citizens on SSI; the number of non-citizens on SSI has exploded from 370,000 in 1989 to more than 800,000 today as immigrants have taken advantage of this welfare spigot. Republicans were right to shut it off. Moreover, any fiddling with the SSI provision will go through the Senate Finance Committee, where Republicans have nominal control only (liberal Sens. Jim Jeffords and John Chafee account for the GOP's two-vote margin on the committee), which means that any changes on SSI will be accompanied by other ``fixes,'' such as expansions of Medicaid coverage and new mandates on the states. Congressional Republicans should send a clear message to their brethren in the governors' mansions: Hands off welfare reform.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>The new welfare bill limits the amount of food stamps that able-bodied, childless adults under age fifty who work less than twenty hours a week may receive. New York Gov. George Pataki has not sought a waiver to stop these cuts in his state, prompting this dispatch from the <I>New York Times</I>: ``Advocates for the poor and religious leaders . . . are particularly disturbed, they say, because food stamps, unlike other welfare programs, are paid for solely by the Federal Government.'' Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, asks, ``Isn't the job of a governor to make sure he maximizes federal revenues?'' Isn't that in one of the <I>Federalist Papers</I>?


<P>
<hr>
<P>
<LI>Proponents of tax reform have from time to time questioned the political wisdom of trying to reform the tax code with one bill. A proposal by Alan Reynolds and Stephen Moore transforms the politics of tax reform by applying the free-market principles of choice and competition. They would leave the current tax code alone, but allow anyone to opt out by paying an ``alternative maximum tax,'' or MaxTax, of 25 per cent (with only one break, a credit for payroll taxes paid). It would be impossible to claim that this flat tax would raise <I>anybody's</I> taxes, and it would lower tax rates for millions of Americans. In addition, the difficult transition problems that have concerned technical analysts of tax reform would melt away. (Deductions would not have to be phased out; they would simply become optional.) Reynolds and Moore have managed to marry policy wonkery, political savvy, and conceptual elegance.
<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>To clear his name (and do some good) after the Christine Keeler sex scandal, disgraced British war minister John Profumo worked for three decades with underprivileged boys in London's East End. Spiro Agnew waited 21 years before his bust was installed in the Capitol alongside those of the other former Vice Presidents. To restore his own reputation as a brilliant political advisor, fetishist and adulterer Dick Morris required six days, and he now dominates the Sunday-morning talk shows, where he promotes his 359-page memoir. If present trends continue, public officials caught in ethical scandals will some day need no rehabilitation time at all. For instance, a President convincingly accused of sexual harassment might skip directly over the damaging allegations and proceed with the duties of his office as if nothing had happened.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

<LI>Five months after becoming two of the first four women to enter the Citadel, Misses Messer and Mentavlos are leaving. They were forced to sing obscene songs and drink iced tea until they vomited; their sweatshirts were doused with nail-polish remover and ignited. But this is just this kind of behavior that has made the Citadel famous. As appalling as it may seem, setting freshmen on fire is apparently a tradition in Echo company, of which the girls were members. In her farewell statement, Miss Mentavlos asked her male classmates to ``take a long look at how they view their girlfriends, wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters.'' However, by attending the Citadel, Miss Mentavlos endeavored to remove herself from those categories, and from the respect accorded to them. It seems that her fellow students indulged her.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


<LI>In his syndicated <I>Washington Post</I> column, Mark Shields teases <I>NR</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page for having made ``bum predictions'' about the bad effects of President Clinton's 1993 tax increases. Shields's rebuttal consists of listing positive economic trends that followed the tax increase, which he assumes must therefore have been caused by it. Those trends could use some perspective. The President's vaunted ``11 million jobs'' amounts to 1.9 per cent growth each year -- roughly the average rate for the last 25 years, <I>including recessions</I>. It's a far cry from the 2.4 per cent annual job growth registered during the low-tax years of 1983 - 89. Interest rates were falling globally before Clinton's tax; they reversed course soon after it passed, and resumed falling only around the time the Republicans took Congress. The deficit is down mostly because of that fall in interest rates, plus reckless defense cuts and the winding down of the S&L bailout. Tax revenues have increased because of the economic upswing that was well under way when Clinton was elected, but compared to the pre - tax-hike years, revenues are a smaller proportion of an economy that is growing more slowly. And Shields is counting his chickens too soon: the final installment of Clinton's tax hike came in April 1996. Already there are signs that the economy is running out both of workers and of savings. (If the Administration responds by trying to talk the dollar down, get ready for a hard landing.) Shields concluded his column: ``It doesn't hurt to admit publicly you have been wrong.'' Tell it to the President.

<LI>In the ongoing battle over Wisconsin's schoolchildren, a state judge, Paul Higginbotham, has again blocked the use of state funds for a voucher program that includes religious schools. His ruling acknowledged the ``sad plight of Milwaukee's public-school system'' (``sad'' is a mild word for a system in which only one-third of the students entering high school -- and only one-quarter of the black students -- graduate). But Judge Higginbotham found, predictably, that using tax dollars for anything connected however remotely with religion was unconstitutional -- ignoring the facts that a) nowadays, the religious content in most parochial schools is distinctly secondary; and b) the public schools themselves inculcate a religion, though not one having anything to do with the God of anyone's fathers. Judge Higginbotham's word is not the last one: the Milwaukee-based Parents for School Choice will take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary; meanwhile PAVE (Partners Advancing Values in Education) will continue to provide private vouchers to as many children as it can.

<LI>An ``Inaugural Gala'' on January 22 featured Vice President Al Gore as the keynote speaker and Tipper Gore as presenter of a Lifetime Achievement Award to Robin Chandler Duke of the National Abortion Rights Action League. Pretty brinky to use ``lifetime'' in an award to a person whose ``achievement'' was campaigning to shorten millions of lifetimes to nine months, or less.

<LI>``I am of Ireland, and the Holy Land of Ireland . . .'' Whether one thinks of Ireland as a holy land or, with some of her angrier sons, as a ``priest-ridden nation,'' one tends to think of her as a Catholic country still. John O'Sullivan's report in these pages a few years ago that Dublin was now scarcely distinguishable from any other European capital came as a shock. But not long afterward voters approved a constitutional change permitting divorce, and the first divorce has now been granted. Banning divorce doesn't necessarily keep marriages intact, as witness the tens of thousands of long-separated couples who signed up to obtain divorces as soon as the referendum passed. But one hopes that in moving into this new era, Ireland will cast an eye (not cold) on the wreckage that America's current no-fault laws have caused, and go slow.

<P><LI>Mexico pays its debt to the U.S., ahead of schedule; we make a cool $500 million in interest; investor confidence is restored. Is it too good to be true? In a word, si. As anyone who has spent time there recently can attest, Mexico is more chaotic than ever. Drug trafficking, violence, and official corruption have never been worse, and despite the rah-rah boosterism that permeates Wall Street generally -- and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> in particular -- Mexico hasn't begun the privatization and deregulation needed to get its economy moving again. Virtually all the money used to pay the U.S. was borrowed from other lenders at exorbitant interest rates. Our bailout of Mexico two years ago meant, in effect, that we guaranteed the loans Mexico used to pay us off. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso is again overvalued, and the current-account deficit is growing. It may soon be time for another successful rescue.

<LI>Until recently, no one would have bet that Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his Liberal Party would not be easily returned to office in the election expected this year. But this month, Chr&eacutetien's government was forced to make a public apology to Progressive Conservative former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. In a letter to Swiss government authorities, the Chr&eacutetien government had charged Mulroney and two others with accepting $3.75 million in kickbacks from the sale of Airbus passenger planes to the Canadian national airline in 1988. The accusation was then leaked to the media by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While Mulroney is widely said to have presided over the most corrupt government in recent Canadian history, the Liberals have been unable to provide evidence linking him to the Airbus scandal, and they now stand accused of using state power against a political opponent. The right-wing populist Reform Party, which stresses government integrity, is well positioned to benefit and expand its support beyond its western base. With unemployment remaining stubbornly at 10 per cent (despite Chr&eacutetien's promise of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''), defeated Liberals may soon swell the figures.

<P><LI>After so much bad news from the academy, it is a pleasure to hear something very different. At Dartmouth there is traditionally a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in the middle of the campus. The Glee Club turns out to sing carols, and many students join them. This December, the administration decreed that no songs with any religious content would be sung. The Glee Club was obliged to make do with ``Frosty the Snowman'' and ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'' The next night, however, the Glee Club appeared at the tree unofficially and, joined by hundreds of students, sang ``Silent Night,'' ``Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,'' and ``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.'' This was not the sort of Free Speech that Mario Savio had in mind, no, not at all.

WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> Louisiana Independent Federation of Electors, Inc. (LIFE) is arguably the most powerful political force in New Orleans. Operated by the city's mayor, the cocksure 39-year-old Marc Morial, and his political associates, it exerted a decisive influence in November's elections, putting a small army of workers on the street on election day. It is to monitor the activities of just such big-stakes political players that Louisiana and the Federal Government have campaign-finance laws. And it is exactly to escape such scrutiny that LIFE flouts all of them, failing to register or file reports with the Louisiana Board of Ethics, the Louisiana Secretary of State's office, or the Federal Election Commission.
<P>
LIFE is an outlaw political group at least in this sense -- and perhaps in others as well. After months of combing through New Orleans election records and interviewing city residents, Republican Woody Jenkins's campaign has compiled a stunning array of evidence to suggest that Democrat Mary Landrieu's slim 5,788-vote victory over him in November's Senate race was tainted by widespread corruption, including the outright buying of votes. 
<P>
At the center of the alleged misconduct in Louisiana are LIFE and the well-heeled gambling interests that helped deliver New Orleans for Mary Landrieu by more than 100,000 votes. The Jenkins campaign conducted a dozen interviews with New Orleans residents -- all of them living in the inner city -- who say they were promised cash for voting. With the understanding that the names of the interviewees would be withheld, the Jenkins campaign allowed <I>NR</I> to review the tapes. The number of illegal votes accounted for in the interviews isn't more than fifty or so. But the illegal practices recounted seem to implicate Mayor Morial's political organization in blatant wrongdoing, and to suggest a larger pattern of illegality that puts the integrity of Miss Landrieu's victory in serious doubt.
<P>
 <LI> One New Orleans woman explained to a Jenkins investigator that she ``was sitting on my porch when this nice person drove up in a . . . car and asked me whether or not I was registered voter or not. And I told him I was but I didn't feel like going. And he said, 'Well, if I paid you would you go then?' And quite naturally, a ride and the money, I got up and dusted off my little pants and got in the car.'' The woman, who couldn't read, says the man, working off a yellow (LIFE-produced) sample ballot, marked how she was to vote and then took her to three different locations where she voted and signed her name ``X'' each time.
<P>
<LI> A New Orleans man told a Jenkins investigator that he went to three different polling places and voted at each four or five times. He says he was paid $60 for each stop, was carried in a van with several other people, and was handed a yellow sample ballot that fits the description of the LIFE sample ballot (differently colored sample ballots, distributed in massive quantities on election day, are the hallmarks of the various New Orleans political organizations). The man says he didn't have to sign in or stand in line at the various polling places.
<P>
<LI> ``Well, my friend had asked me did I want to go vote,'' another New Orleans woman told a Jenkins investigator. ``She said they was paying people to go vote for this person. I say who was the person? She say Mary, Mary Landrieu.'' The woman got in a van that had three bench seats behind the driver and was driven to three polling places and given a LIFE sample ballot off which to vote. She was promised $25 for each stop. ``Hey, hey all I got was $25!'' she complains in the interview. ``We went to three places. The agreement was we was supposed to get $25 each place.'' As consolation, she was given a Mary Landrieu T-shirt: ``They promise you, and then they going give us ol' stanky T-shirt with her picture on it.'' (She threw the T-shirt away in a dumpster.)
<P>
All the interviews follow a similar pattern: An election worker promises someone money to vote; he transports him to the polls in a car or van full of people; he gives them a LIFE ballot to show them for whom and for what to vote; the voter either signs his name at multiple polling places or doesn't sign at all or, in one case, signs someone else's name. Some of the interviews suggest a fairly well-organized effort. One woman says that she was taken in a van to a polling place where she voted twice, once in her own name, the second time in a name given to her by the driver. She says the driver selected who would vote at which polling places.
<P>
The interviews also suggest that polling commissioners -- often long-serving local residents who are cozy with the neighborhood's political operators -- were active participants in the illegalities, allowing selected voters to jump lines at polling places and to vote without signing their names or being checked for identification. One man who says he stood in line for an hour and a half at one polling place complained to a Jenkins investigator that twice he saw four vans pull up full of people who were allowed to jump the line and vote immediately: ``They wasn't signing the book or nothin'. Just goin' in and comin' back out.''
<P>
It's not an accident that multiple voters would end up with LIFE sample ballots in their hands. An integral part of Mayor Morial's patronage-fed political machine, LIFE had an enormous presence on the streets of New Orleans on election day. Among the roughly one thousand LIFE street workers were more than a hundred unclassified city employees -- i.e., political appointees --  assigned to its headquarters for the day (another hundred were assigned to other Democratic campaigns throughout the city). In theory, such work is voluntary. In practice, city workers seem compelled to do the mayor's political bidding. 
<P>
According to a sworn affidavit by Victor M. Ortiz, a former assistant city attorney, his immediate supervisor, City Attorney Avis Marie Russell, convened a meeting on Monday, October 28, at which she said ``that it was mandatory . . . that all unclassified employees report for campaign activities for Nov. 2 and Nov. 5 or that there would be 'consequences.''' Mr. Ortiz maintains that on election day Miss Russell told him to report for campaign work or resign. She disputes his account. But in a letter responding to his resignation, she writes, ``At no time during my tenure as City Attorney have you indicated <I>any</I> problem with participating in campaign activities'' (emphasis in original).
<P>
All along, the Jenkins campaign has maintained that it was the intersection of interests between the LIFE machine and gambling companies that created the conditions for election-day corruption on a massive scale. There were local-option initiatives on the ballot in New Orleans asking for voter approval of video poker, riverboat gambling, and a New Orleans land-based casino. Altogether, gambling interests spent an estimated $8 to $10 million statewide. The New Orleans - based Harrah's Jazz, the currently bankrupt licensee for the land-based casino, was authorized by a federal judge to spend some $1 million. Mayor Morial opposed the New Orleans casino when he was a state senator, but conveniently switched convictions last year, putting LIFE on the side of the flood of gambling money.
<P>
It made for a perfect confluence of interests: LIFE with its deep roots in the community, the gambling interests with their deep pockets. While the gambling interests had no particular stake in electing Mary Landrieu, they would have wanted to help their crucial new friend, Marc Morial, for whom electing Miss Landrieu was a key political goal. Harrah's, according to a campaign-finance filing immediately after the election, hired about a thousand street workers on November 4 and 5. This effort was in some ways indistinguishable from LIFE's. In interviews with Jenkins investigators, 13 out of 20 randomly selected Harrah's election-day workers admitted to either handing out LIFE literature or picking up their Harrah's paychecks at LIFE offices. (Harrah's says it distributed all checks to workers directly.)
<P>
Evidence implicates both LIFE and the gambling interests in vote hauling. In Louisiana it is illegal for a political organization to pay its workers (although they can volunteer) to drive voters to the polls because the practice has traditionally been associated with vote buying. Not only were LIFE ballots apparently handed out in the vans transporting multiple voters, but the Jenkins campaign has obtained a handful of rental agreements between LIFE workers and a rental company just outside New Orleans for vans. Also, in a transcript of a taped conversation between what the Jenkins campaign identifies as a ``confidential source'' and a man named ``Ted,'' who appears to work for a gambling company, the two discuss driving people to the polls in company vans.
<P>
The question now is what the Senate is going to do about all this. Based on the evidence produced so far there should, by rights, be a national firestorm of outrage at practices in Louisiana (remember the uproar when Christine Todd Whitman consultant Ed Rollins just let the words ``walking-around money'' cross his lips?). The chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee is now considering Jenkins's evidence, and will decide probably in February whether to launch its own investigation. Mary Landrieu has taken the air out of some of the weaker aspects of Jenkins's case (for instance, ``mismatches'' between signatures on voter-registration cards and precinct registers), but her response to the alleged multiple voters is essentially ``It couldn't happen here.'' If a Senate investigation confirms and expands on the evidence gathered by Jenkins, people should go to jail and a new Senate election be called.
<P>
Any suggestion of a new election, of course, will provoke howls of protest from Democrats. Mary Landrieu's defenders will maintain that she has not been directly implicated in the fraud and that no one has produced evidence of exactly 5,789 illegal votes, both of which will probably prove to be true. But when a six-year term in the U.S. Senate is at stake, the integrity of the result should be beyond a reasonable doubt. Allowing elections to stand that have been tainted by Third World electoral practices undermines the foundations of American democracy. As one soulful multiple voter told a Jenkins investigator, ``The way things is going. I mean . . . it makes you not want to get out there and participate.'' Tell it to Woody Jenkins.

<H2>Poor Paula Jones</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JANUARY 14<br>




On the Paula Jones business, what are the points that have crystallized?
<P>
1. If the Court permits the case to proceed against Mr. Clinton, it will not involve the immobilization of the Chief Executive. Justice Souter and again Justice O'Connor said, in various ways, addressing the defendant's attorneys: Look. We are not suggesting that if simultaneously the Paula Jones judge issues a subpoena for the President's appearance and Japan declares war on us, the President will have to go to the courthouse instead of the war room. 
<P>
Driving that point home took rather more time than one would have thought necessary, but after all, it is the open strategy of the defense to argue that the President of the United States simply can't be distracted by long and tedious civil suits while he is in office. 
<P>
2. Some pleasure was to be had from hearing such big-time lawyers as Mr. Robert Bennett going on about the travails of victims of civil suits. The smiling over that one has to do with President Clinton's indenture to the predatory lawyer class which asks for, and often gets, preposterous judgments for relatively trivial offenses. Tort-damage reform has been on the GOP agenda for several years, which resulted in the trial lawyers' association contributing a whopping $2 million to Democratic campaigns. It is fun to hear the representative of a predatory class outline the terrible public consequences of litigious greed. (Mrs. Jones, incidentally, has been asking for $700,000, which is less than one-third of the money Mr. Clinton has already spent in defending himself.)
<P>
3. The behavior of the Emily's List-type ladies is the crowning hypocrisy. These are women who pledged themselves for all time to end the political career of any senator who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas. The reason for this, Emily says, is obvious: Anita Hill was the object of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas. 
<P>
But how do we know this? one is likely to ask.
<P>
<I>Idiot! We know it because sexual harassment is rife. . . . And because Anita Hill is a Yale graduate, and incapable of lying. . . . And because Clarence Thomas is a conservative and therefore presumptively unreliable. Can't you add up two and two?</I>
<P>
There is some discomfort out there in the feminist ranks over the presumptions against Paula Jones. James Carville understood the situation perfectly when he opined that when you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you come up with such as Paula Jones. It's informative to hear such language from a Tobacco Road populist. 
<P>
But finally,<br>
4. we have to acknowledge that the President of the United States has responsibilities that inevitably give him distinctive protections. Over the weekend viewers could amuse themselves by watching PBS's <I>A Royal Scandal</I>, depicting the fervent sexual activities of a Prince of Wales (not the incumbent). One wonders where Emily was when most needed. Prince George married a Catholic girl and lived with her. Then he went to a mistress. Then he imported a princess from Germany to firm up the blue bloodlines of an heir, which he managed to procreate, but quickly distanced himself from the princess and years later, never mind that she was now ``queen,'' denied her access to his coronation at Westminster. In between he had other mistresses. Wanton love-life is an apanage of the royal class, and we don't mean just King George IV, but also Warren Gamaliel Harding.
<P> 
It is by no means to condone the sexual behavior of Mr. Clinton, pre and post Paula Jones, to accept the realities of presidential eminence. True, Paula Jones was an unwilling vehicle for his lust, and for that reason the Court must not under any circumstances -- indeed, it cannot -- simply make the charges go away. But the compromise everywhere suggested is reasonable: to permit the taking of affidavits while memories are fresh, and wait until the millennium to actually bring the defendant to court. 
<P>
It would have been much easier if my advice had been taken three years ago, which was to raise the $700,000 and give it to Mrs. Jones, with a note saying: We don't agree that Mr. Clinton is guilty, but pending a revision of tort laws, this is cheaper than engaging in a defense against your charges.

You know what? I'm not sure you missed much by not coming to the Inaugural festivities. In the first place, what could possibly match the 1992 celebration: me and Tip doing our own ``Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk'' at the MTV bash, Bill warbling away on the sax, and HRC still a few hours away from identifying the White House Travel Office as the first place to begin reinventing government -- you know, back then we had a sense that the country was turning a corner. 
<P>
A lot of our hopefulness was embodied by Maya Angelou's terrific poem, especially in the lines:
<P> 
The Rock. The Paper. The Scissors. Paper covers Rock. Scissors cut Paper. Rock blunts Scissors.
<P> 
When you think that her poem was a major bestseller for weeks after the 1992 Inauguration, it's hard not to get nostalgic.
<P> 
So this year, it was with a somewhat heavy heart that I took the oath of the office of Vice President for the last time. It'll be nice, I guess, to take the oath of the office of President the next time around, but you know what? It won't be as special. 
<P>
I guess my melancholy attitude comes from something Tipper said last week. You remember, Rusty, that there was a brouhaha in the final days of the campaign about a fundraiser I attended at a Buddhist monastery in California. It turned out that many of the contributions were not quite strictly legal in the most literal and picky definition of the word ``legal,'' and worse, when I said I didn't know at the time that the fundraiser was a fundraiser I wasn't being strictly truthful in the most literal and picky definition of the word ``truthful.''
<P>
``You're turning into him,'' Tipper said, when I showed her the press release which admitted that I had ``fudged'' on the issue.
<P> 
``Who?'' I asked. ``Dad?'' 
<P>
``No, Al. Him. Bill. The kind of guy who lies -- ''
<P>
I cleared my throat. 
<P>
``I'm sorry,'' she went on. ``The kind of guy who fudges so often and about so many small things that he gets the reputation for being a colossal liar -- '' 
<P>
I cleared my throat again.
<P> 
``Okay,'' she said. ``He gets the reputation for being a colossal fudger when what he really is, is a small fudger about a lot of things.''
<P> 
``What's your point, Tip?'' I asked. 





</tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
<TABLE>
<tr>
<TH></TH>
<td>
``My point is, be careful. The press is tired of beating up on Bill. It's too easy. And they're almost tired of beating up on Newt. I mean, the guy is jowly and has bad hair. How challenging is that? It's like hunting dairy cows.''
<P> 
Tipper has a colorful way of phrasing things. But I still didn't get her point. 
<P>
``What are you saying, Tip?'' I asked. ``That the press doesn't like me? Are you kidding? I mean, I hate to toot my own horn, but I'm the only one they do like around here.'' 
<P>
``Uh huh,'' Tip murmured. ``Wait 'til they read about your little white fudge.'' 
<P>
What happened was just as I predicted: we issued the press release, and it ended up somewhere near the ``Land Use Judgments'' section of the Post. The press was still pretty much centered on Gingrich and his ethical problems -- among them, lying about what he knew and when (and he's second in line for the Presidency! Where's the outrage in America?) -- so my little mea culpa was not much noted by some of the White House press corps. (The guy from Newsweek called me ``courageous and forthright''; Time suggested that ``we pause in our outrage that Speaker Gingrich flouted the regulations governing the use of 501(c)(3) funds, and celebrate the Vice President's admission that in the hurly-burly of campaigning, he might have been misunderstood''; and Marty Peretz called to ask if the whole thing wasn't a case of my being so distraught over my sister's death from lung cancer, brought vividly to mind by the incense smoke, that I missed seeing the 67 shoeboxes stuffed with checks and cash. I had to admit his analysis was probably correct.) 
<P>
As I was tying my tie this morning, I joked to Tipper that she had gotten it all wrong, that the press loves me, and that my little fudge didn't signal anything remotely like my becoming Bill. 
<P>
She glowered at me. She hates it when I'm right. But I was having fun, so I pressed on. 
<P>
``I mean, it's not me that we have to worry about, Tip. It's you. You know what I think? I think you're becoming a little bit like her. That's what I think.'' 
Chuckling, I slipped the knot in my tie and glanced in the mirror. I barely saw her pick up the lamp. 
<P>
So whatever it was, the weather, the smaller crowd, or the throbbing pain on the left side of my head, all I can say is, I enjoyed 1992 a lot more. 
<P>
See you soon, Rusty.

<FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT><font size=+1>aving</font> written off Bill Clinton for most of 1995, Republicans are now tempted to ascribe supernatural powers of persuasion to him. Neither attitude encourages constructive thought on how to counter his strategy. But despite the image of an Administration adrift, President Clinton has arrived, through a mixture of accident and design, at a strategy for Democrats to survive and perhaps even prosper in ideologically uncongenial times. While there may not be a Clintonian ideology, it is possible to speak of a Clintonian style of politics.
<P>
Its most important feature has been the attempted retooling of the Democratic Party as the servant of middle-class interests through the mechanism of government. Clinton pollster Stan Greenberg explained the reasoning in a much-noted essay in the Fall 1991 <I>American Prospect</I>: ``Democrats need to rediscover broad-based social policy that sends a larger message: Democrats are for 'everybody,' not just the 'have-nots.' That means defending and enlarging social insurance initiatives that reach the lower and middle classes rather than constructing safety nets that protect only the poor.'' Means-tested programs stigmatize recipients and are, Greenberg thinks, easy to cut; middle-class entitlements are forever.
<P>
National health insurance, a longstanding goal of the Left, was thus also a means of expanding the Democratic voter base and creating a permanent Democratic majority. It would do to the middle class what Social Security had done to the elderly: make a majority of them beholden to the Federal Government and its political champions, in this case for their very lives. As Grace-Marie Arnett points out, the Clintons have pursued this objective with essentially Fabian tactics. They have tried to establish beachheads within the health-care market from which to launch new government interventions. The Clintons' 1993 - 94 health-care ``reform'' effort would have been a large, and probably irreversible, step toward socialized medicine. Time is already beginning to obscure just how close they came.
<P>
Clinton's repeated proposals to expand subsidies for higher education are a smaller-scale version of the same entitlement strategy. The government will now step forward to finance increased access to the very sectors of the economy the government has most inflated. It's a proposal well crafted to help Clinton make inroads among traditional GOP strongholds in the middle class and even upper middle class. The Republican Congress has forced Clinton to spend more time playing defense: instead of increasing public dependence on government, he has been vigilantly blocking cuts in government programs that benefit people who work. Clinton's massive expansion of the earned income tax credit, and subsequent determination to protect that expansion from Republican budget-cutters, is a case in point.
<P>
Even on welfare, where President Clinton has felt it necessary to appear responsive to middle-class demands for reform and retrenchment, he has assiduously avoided policies that would reduce the scope and power of government or its allied institutions in liberaldom. Indeed, as Robert Rector observes, Clinton originally sought window-dressing reforms that would actually increase the power of the welfare establishment.
<P>
After the Republicans took Congress, he moved toward a liberal version of welfare reform, which, geared as it is toward processing people through welfare rather than keeping them off it, creates opportunities for expanding state services: child-care subsidies, job training, transportation assistance, child-support enforcement. Clinton has followed a similar pattern on education: he has a long history of supporting the least reform the public demands and the most the education establishment will tolerate. So, for instance, he's all in favor of charter schools, as long as they don't escape the burden of federal regulations or threaten the power of teachers' unions.
<P>
To woo the middle class, Clinton has also had to tack center-right on ``values.'' Greenberg readily acknowledged the point in his 1991 essay: ``Democrats cannot win over the average family,'' he wrote, ``unless there are some limits on the party's moral agnosticism.'' Clinton's cultural rhetoric is now to the right of George Bush's. We know that President Clinton read Ben Wattenberg's <I>Values Matter Most</I>, and he has talked incessantly about ``values'' ever since. (The popularity of that word ought, incidentally, to depress conservatives. ``'Values' beat 'virtues' eleven to nothing in a focus group we did,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``It's amazing Bill Bennett sold any books.'')
<P>
On social and cultural issues, Clinton has used the bully pulpit quite effectively to signal that he shares the public's values. And if, when Clinton says that he supports introducing school uniforms or firing incompetent teachers, some people are misled to believe that he has some policy initiative to translate the rhetoric into reality, well, that's no skin off his back. He has struck a particularly tough pose on crime, though, as David Kopel observes, there is much less to his record than meets the eye. Clinton's gauzy communitarian rhetoric is also deployed on fiscal issues. During last fall's budget showdown, he was constantly claiming to be defending ``our values'' from Republicans intent on taking medicine away from the elderly and protection from the environment. This kind of values-laden talk is probably necessary for parties of the Center - Left for the foreseeable future. (Tony Blair, leader of Britain's Labour Party, does it too.)
<P>
In addition to pulling more middle-class voters into the Democratic coalition, President Clinton also wanted to co-opt parts of American business. In some respects, ClintonCare was a failed attempt to do so: it offered major financial benefits to large manufacturers and insurers. The Administration's support for high-tech subsidies was a play for Silicon Valley. The re-orientation of American trade policy toward bilateral deals, sometimes company-specific, enabled the Administration to dispense favors to exporters at its discretion. And the ultimate logic of the ``corporate responsibility'' themes many Democrats are pushing is to transform American businesses into docile servants of the welfare state.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N HIS</font> zeal to expand his base, Clinton has not forgotten more reliable Democratic constituencies. So federal funding of labor unions has increased (and it has been made easier for them to use compulsory dues on political activity). The Violence Against Women Act has funneled money to feminist organizations, and ``AIDS education'' programs to the gay Left. The 1993 ``stimulus'' bill was a payback to big-city mayors; when it failed, much of its substance was included in the next year's crime bill. Restrictions on the politicization of the federal work force have been loosened considerably.
<P>
Clinton's sheer political talent should not be underestimated as a factor in the success of this strategy. Nor, for that matter, should the frequency and facility of his lies. He is able to call high-mindedly for bipartisan statesmanship and then, in the next breath, launch a furious attack on the motives of his opponents -- who, we are to believe, <I>want</I> children to drink dirty water, eat diseased meat, and smoke. Yet Clinton is simultaneously a soothing figure. He is able to appeal to that strain of public sentiment that wants the noise and bickering from Washington to stop. His rhetoric is also appealing because it tells the voters they can have it all: a balanced budget without cutting entitlements; environmental regulation without economic costs; welfare reform without anyone suffering. He's the perfect practitioner of the politics of painlessness: for everything that's good, against everything bad. (In fairness, some Republicans, particularly of the Gingrich - Kemp brand, are prone to this as well.)
<P>
Another reason for Clintonism's success is that, as many commentators have noted, this White House focuses on its political health to an unprecedented degree. American foreign policy toward Ireland and Haiti has been driven largely by domestic political considerations. The church-burning issue was basically a whipped-up hysteria designed to persuade black voters that white racism is still the chief threat to their well-being. And the Administration skillfully orchestrates the appearance of a constant flurry of activity -- no matter how microscopic the initiative or gesture, how inadequate the rapid response. The Administration provides motion without progress, a perpetual campaign. President Clinton hasn't declared for re-election; would anyone notice if he did?
<P>
The chief vulnerability of Clintonism is that even the boldest New Democrat cannot afford to cross some constituencies that are out of sync with the public. Clinton can't sign legal reform because of the trial lawyers. He was willing to anger organized labor over NAFTA, but he has done its bidding on striker replacement and other workplace issues; if the Democrats do well this November, they will be greatly indebted to the AFL-CIO's vigorous campaign on their behalf. And Clinton would not have dared to sign the bill banning partial-birth abortions for fear of incurring the wrath of feminists, a calculation that highlights the vacuum where Clintonism's moral core should be. But the issue that most devastatingly gives the lie to Clinton's pretensions of conservatism -- his support of race and gender preferences -- appears to have been dropped by his opposition.
<P>
The consolation for conservatives is that Clinton doesn't move the debate; he merely positions himself within it. In the first year of the Administration, William Kristol compared the condition of American liberalism to that of Soviet Communism in the late 1970s: both were seemingly dominant, both utterly hollow. For a time it was fashionable in conservative circles to describe health-care reform as liberalism's Afghanistan, the fatal overreach that would precipitate the empire's collapse. Yet in neither case has the old order been unequivocally defeated.
<P>
Now, writes Johnathan Sunley in the summer <I>National Interest</I>, ``Communism as a dogma is dead. . . . The problem facing supposedly 'post-Communist' societies is not a revival of that ideology, but the survival of power structures that escaped the 'revolutions' of 1989 more or less unscathed.'' Just so with contemporary liberalism and the ``revolution'' of 1994. If Bill Clinton wins re-election, his legacy could be that America enters the twenty-first century shackled by the institutional residua of an ideology almost nobody any longer believes.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> pledge to ``end welfare as we know it'' was the centerpiece of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. Voters were blitzed with TV ads promising to put welfare recipients to work and proposing an apparent two-year time limit on receipt of benefits. But on no topic has the Clintonian chasm between word and deed been broader than on welfare.
<P>
Americans have lived through many an ``end to welfare.'' In 1988, Congress passed the ``Family Support Act,'' a mammoth bipartisan reform that was promised ``to replace welfare with work.'' In reality, the bill required almost no one to work; AFDC caseloads ballooned by 30 per cent.
<P>
Nearly 90 per cent of voters still want welfare recipients to work for benefits. Their antipathy to the existing welfare system creates a real hurdle for liberal legislators seeking to preserve and expand it. Hence, even the most left-wing proposals now come well armored in conservative slogans. By the mid Eighties periodic sham reform had become welfare's life blood, assuaging public discontent while masking the growth of the system.
<P>
Initially, it seemed Clinton might break this pattern. In his first month in office, he repeated his promise to end welfare and to make recipients work. In addition, in a speech before the National Governors' Association, he promised to encourage state welfare experimentation through waivers. Critically, he proposed to ``approve waivers that I did not necessarily agree with . . . the nature of the experiment is that one person has an idea different from another person.''
<P>
Reality quickly began to jostle the political rhetoric. President Clinton appointed, as head of HHS, Donna Shalala, who had served with Mrs. Clinton on the board of the Children's Defense Fund, an organization that had opposed even the token reforms of 1988. Charged with implementing Mr. Clinton's key campaign pledge to end welfare, Miss Shalala gave only a single grudging sentence to the topic in her confirmation testimony. Senator Moynihan felt compelled to upbraid her for her indifference.
<P>
Conservatives willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt on welfare, including this author, had their illusions dispelled abruptly when the President unveiled his first budget. Work had disappeared from the agenda. Clinton had stated that the ``reform'' of 1988 had been well designed but had been crippled by a lack of funds for JOBS, the program that nominally enforced work requirements.
<P>
By Washington standards, JOBS was a dwarf program costing about $1 billion out of an annual welfare spending pot of $234 billion. Thus, if lack of money were really holding up reform, it would be easy to jump-start ``work, not welfare,'' by giving it more.
<P>
But Clinton's budget didn't add one thin dime to the work program. He did propose large increases in almost every other type of welfare spending. Proposed new spending initiatives in conventional welfare programs (food stamps, housing, Head Start, etc.) amounted, over five years, to $100 billion above the already explosive growth in baseline spending. Having, on the campaign trail, trumpeted ``ending welfare'' and making recipients work, Clinton in office did exactly the opposite: ignoring workfare while seeking to expand traditional welfare spending.
<P>
Bolder reversals followed. The 1988 reform, pathetic though it was, included some minute work requirements squeezed in, with great effort, by conservative legislators. Avoiding undue haste, the liberal Congress decreed that these work requirements were not to take effect until 1994 (six years after passage) and would affect only some two-parent families comprising 6 per cent of the AFDC rolls. These provisions were the first and only work requirements passed into law. The Clinton Administration quietly sought to abolish them, through a change hidden deep within the vast Omnibus Budget Act. This maneuver outraged even the <I>New York Times</I>, and the attempted repeal failed.
<P>
While retreating at full speed on the work issue, President Clinton did break decisive new ground on another, unexpected front. Although he had predictably attacked Dan Quayle's Murphy Brown speech on illegitimacy, Clinton reversed course once in office. He began to speak out against rising illegitimacy, warning that the collapse of marriage was a root cause of crime and other social problems. On television, he acknowledged that Charles Murray was right: welfare promoted out-of-wedlock births. In his first State of the Union address, Clinton warned that society was threatened by an illegitimate birth rate that would soon hit 50 per cent.
<P>
Of course, Clinton never intended actually to do anything about illegitimacy. But, often, a President's words do count. And no President, including Ronald Reagan, had ever spoken this way against illegitimacy. Like Nixon's trip to China, Clinton's speeches about marriage and illegitimacy permanently altered the national debate. An issue which many politicians had been afraid even to mention was now raised to prominence, even urgency. For this, the country owes Bill Clinton a profound debt of thanks.
<P>
In the realm of deed rather than word, however, the Clinton Administration continued to drift left. While still arguing that more funding was the key to reform, Clinton again failed in his second budget to provide more money for workfare thus ensuring that his campaign pledge to make welfare recipients work would not even begin to take effect until 1996, if at all. Finally, in the summer of 1994, Clinton unveiled his grand welfare-reform plan. Not surprisingly, it was a parody of liberal anti-reforms parading in conservative prose. It didn't require work, and effectively prohibited states from doing so. There was no ``two years and off'' rule. In its place was the following provision: no one would be required to work for the first two years on welfare; among those exceeding the two-year limit, some tiny portion would be required to do community-service work but only under restrictions that would make dependency reduction impossible.
<P>
Although 70 per cent of the AFDC caseload at any given time have been on welfare for over two years, the bill required only 7 per cent of the caseload to work by 1999. These welfare recipients would work only 15 hours per week and would receive an effective wage of $15 per hour (counting all benefits). The bill allocated $4,000 in administrative overhead for each workfare participant. At many job sites, recipients doing community-service work would become members of public-sector unions. The Clinton Administration had been truthful on one point: ``ending welfare as we know it'' in this manner would cost a lot more than the status quo. The real costs of the proposal were discreetly hidden, off budget, in future years.
<p>
On illegitimacy, the bill proposed the status quo and triumphantly called it reform. To obtain welfare, unwed mothers under age 18 would have to live with their parents. But 90 per cent of out-of-wedlock births occur to women over 18, and most young teen mothers already live with their parents. Moreover, it is quite likely that the teen's mother had once been an unmarried welfare mother herself, and was thus more a cause of the problem than its solution.
<p>
In attempting to conceal the policy vacuum on illegitimacy the Administration's press releases made bold proclamations about abstinence and teaching young people to delay sexual activity. But the bill itself mentioned neither marriage nor abstinence; instead it offered tired liberal nostrums: condom distribution, self-esteem building, values clarification, ``life skills training,'' etc. This was no surprise, since Donna Shalala abhorred abstinence education and had spent the prior year trying to abolish the government's single tiny abstinence program.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT> short, the 622-page ``end of welfare'' bill was nearly a carbon copy of the bogus reforms of 1988. It would have ``ended welfare'' by enlarging it.
<p>
For decades, the welfare state had rested uneasily on this sort of deception: the ability of liberal politicians to say one thing while doing another. As long as Democrats controlled Congress, Clinton could talk tough and still satisfy left-wing interest groups. Then came the 1994 election. After years of rhetorical philandering, Clinton suddenly faced a shotgun wedding with a Republican Congress eager to do the things Clinton only gabbed about. The House advanced legislation to establish work requirements and time limits, slow the automatic growth of welfare spending, reward states for cutting dependence, combat illegitimacy, and end the entitlement status of welfare. In the new political context, Clinton's bill was so liberal that Democrats never bothered to bring it to the floor of the House or Senate. Finally, the President himself disparaged his own legislation in an interview with Ben Wattenberg, a fitting end to a farce.
<p>
Clinton was now stretched in a three-way tug of war between his own rhetoric, the liberals who controlled most of his party and Administration, and the Republican Congress. The result was incoherence and a series of policy reversals, culminating, last winter, when Clinton supported the welfare-reform bill passed in the Senate and then vetoed virtually identical legislation a few weeks later, during the night of the record blizzard. After the veto, White House operatives sought to burnish the President's image as a reformer. Clinton, they claimed, had already fulfilled his pledge to end welfare by granting waivers to reform-minded governors (mostly Republican). Again the facts were otherwise: while Clinton had specifically promised to grant waivers for ideas he did not agree with, Secretary Shalala garrisoned HHS like Stalingrad; many conservative proposals were simply rejected, others greatly curtailed. Each conservative waiver had to be fought out clause by clause. California and Massachusetts simply rejected the modified waivers offered them.
<p>
The flip-flops continued. In May, in an effort to upstage Bob Dole, Clinton praised Governor Tommy Thompson's new reform plans, even though Wisconsin's initiative was several light years to the right of the legislation the President had vetoed four months earlier. Within 24 hours, White House spokesman Harold Ickes had indicated that the Administration had serious reservations about the Wisconsin waiver. Then came a reversal of the reversal, and another reversal, and so forth. But the substance of the debate continued to shift rightward. In July the White House backed the Castle - Tanner bill which ended the entitlement status of AFDC and copied many features of the legislation Clinton had vetoed in January. A lid was also put on the more extreme members of the Administration eager to prove ``scientifically'' that ending the entitlement status of welfare would yield millions of starving kids. Press spokesman Mike McCurry admitted that such studies (which had provided justification for the earlier veto) were sometimes ``a worthless exercise.''
<p>
At the end of July Congress passed a softened version of last year's legislation. Critically, Congress omitted Medicaid reforms to avoid a threatened veto. The President had apparently promised liberal groups he would ``save'' Medicaid; having kept his promise, he may have felt more free to reform AFDC, the least popular welfare program. After a debate within the White House, the President declared he would sign the bill. Although vacillating wildly on policy, Bill Clinton the politician has always grasped one simple idea: standing, sword in hand, as the final defender of the fortress of welfare is not a route to long-term popularity. And Bill Clinton does like to be liked.

 health-care plan proposed by the President and Mrs. Clinton demonstrated the scope of their project for socializing a major segment of the U.S. economy. In fact, Hillary Clinton revealed her statist philosophy during a speech in Washington in 1993 when she said, ``It's time to put the common good, the national interest, ahead of individuals.''
<P>
The liberal agenda wasn't just to make health care more affordable and accessible, but also to seduce the middle class into allegiance to the welfare state with a sweeping new entitlement. Fortunately, as Americans learned the details of the plan -- thanks to a network of fax machines, radio talk shows, the internet -- the majority of them saw through it.
<P>
The Clinton plan would have created at least 200 regional alliances, staffed by more than 50,000 bureaucrats, and added more than $70 billion to the federal budget deficit (according to the Congressional Budget Office's February 1994 estimate). The whole scheme would have been enforced with a plethora of fines, penalties, and jail terms for physicians and their patients. Voters registered their displeasure at the polls in November 1994.
<P>
The defeat of ClintonCare was a famous victory -- but an incomplete one. While Clinton-style health reform has receded into the shadows, no stake has been driven through its heart. During her visit to Estonia this July, the First Lady told reporters that government regulation of health care was needed and would happen eventually. Referring to the plan she had spearheaded two years earlier, she said, ``I think that basic model is still the right model.''
<P>
Ira Magaziner, the plan's principal architect, also yearns for vindication. This spring he told a meeting of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island that the American public still cries out for comprehensive reform, and added that President Clinton remains committed to the idea and will try again if a more receptive Congress is elected.
<P>
Having learned their lessons from the delays of the last round, liberal advocates expect to have a bill ready for speedy passage if Clinton is re-elected; their strategy is to strike before opponents have time to mount a campaign. Models currently being developed would begin with universal health coverage for all children, delivered through the structure of health-insurance purchasing cooperatives, government-defined benefits packages, and premium subsidies that characterized the original Clinton plan. The cynical calculation is that legislators would not dare vote against ``KidCare,'' and, once the foundation was in place, liberals could construct, brick by brick, the statist structure they originally envisioned.
<P>
This scenario could be dismissed as a paranoid nightmare -- except that Sen. Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) has forthrightly claimed it as his strategy. He openly acknowledges that he views the insurance-regulation bill he is co-sponsoring with Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) as a down-payment on a federally controlled health-care system. Experience in several states indicates that this attempt to expand access to health insurance would drive up costs, destabilize the market for private health insurance, and leave even more Americans without health insurance, leading to more and more legislation. Which Sen. Kennedy is more than happy to provide. He says, ``We're going to get this done, and we're going to keep coming back at it. . . . If we have a big sweep for Democrats in the House and Senate, we'll get single-payer.''
<P>
The current liberal strategy, in short, which Clinton would continue in a second term, is to offer ``security'' in exchange for incremental losses of freedom, seducing the middle class step by step into dependence.
<P>
Conservatives, meanwhile, have their own incremental strategy. By offering individuals more control over their health-care costs through devices such as medical savings accounts (MSAs), they expect that market incentives will restructure the medical industry from top to bottom, and prove so popular that more and more Americans will demand the savings, efficiency, and security of owning their own health-insurance policies.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the White House and Sen. Kennedy have led the charge against MSAs. Conservatives have fought for months to include MSAs in the Kassebaum - Kennedy bill, but Democratic intransigence and Republican pusillanimity have left MSAs so bound and gagged with restrictions that many conservatives think passage of the bill would do more harm than good.
<P>
Both sides understand that, as with a great battleship, a small shift in the heading can over time lead to a vastly different destination. The competing visions of where Americans should be headed could not be more starkly opposed: in one, health care becomes a state-provided entitlement; in the other, individual freedom and responsibility allow a properly functioning health-care marketplace to evolve. The combatants can be expected to fight to the last breath -- in the 1996 elections and beyond.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font>  Clinton crime record is a centerpiece of the President's re-election campaign. And not surprisingly. After all, the Administration has had major legislative successes and has effectively controlled the policy debate.
<P>
Not that the victories have been cost-free. It was against the strong advice of then - Speaker Tom Foley and then - Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell that Clinton insisted on keeping the ``assault-weapon'' ban in the crime package. The decision may have had profound political effects. Several weeks after the 1994 elections, Clinton told the <I>Cleveland Plain-Dealer</I> that ``the fight for the assault-weapons ban cost 20 members their seats in Congress. . . . The NRA is the reason the Republicans control the House.''
<P>
In exchange, the President won a very small policy victory indeed. The banned guns look ugly, but they fire no faster than other guns, and generally use ammunition less powerful than do ordinary hunting rifles. According to gun-seizure statistics, they are almost never used in crime. Because the ban defines ``assault weapons'' in terms of cosmetic factors such as whether the barrel has a bayonet lug, gun manufacturers are currently selling nearly identical firearms, minus the offending bayonet lugs.
<P>
In placing form over substance, the gun ban perfectly illustrates the whole thrust of the Administration's crime policy. The much-vaunted funding for ``100,000 new cops on the street,'' for instance, actually provides funding for about 20,000 police and leaves localities stuck with the tab for the others. In a jurisdiction like Denver, the bill may add a half-dozen officers to a given shift -- hardly enough to make a real impact on crime control.
<P>
Similarly, the Administration's recently announced plan to trace guns illegally sold to juveniles was actually a long-standing program, trotted out as ``new'' for election purposes. And Clinton's current pet gun-control proposal, a ban on armor-piercing ammunition, was enacted by Congress in 1986. The proposal simply plays off media attention to an inventor's pipe dream about a new type of ammunition he said he was going to create.
<P>
Which isn't to say Clinton has had no impact. No President in American history has done more to promote electronic surveillance of the American people. The Federal Government is conducting wiretaps at record levels. The overwhelming majority of conversations tapped are innocent; of the guilty ones, most involve matters such as drugs and gambling; they are almost never used for bombing cases, the ostensible justification for the new grant of authority.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>O</font> President has been so consistently hostile to the separation between the Federal Government and the states. The Brady Act is an unfunded mandate on overburdened sheriffs and police chiefs to perform background checks on handgun buyers. Curfews, school uniforms, midnight basketball, automatically expelling students who bring guns or knives to school -- whether these policies are wise or unwise is debatable, but they have no business coming from Washington, D.C.
<P>
Centralization of law enforcement undermines accountability. As former Attorney General Edwin Meese put it, ``If voters are dissatisfied with their sheriff, district attorney, or local police force, they can vote the appropriate officials out of office.'' Federal agencies, in contrast, are several steps removed from democratic control. Local control also means fiscal responsibility: federal anti-crime spending tends to tilt heavily toward programs -- such as DARE and the McGruff crime dog -- that sound good on the Senate floor but are proven failures. And federal law enforcement's priorities are not on the crimes against persons and property that most concern Americans, but instead on statutory offenses: controlled substances, firearms, and the like.
<P>
To make matters of centralization worse, Louis Freeh is working to make the FBI a national police force (sending G-men to enforce child-support orders!) and indeed an international one, as it sets up overseas offices and develops close working relationships with the KGB's successor.
<P>
In terms of demagogy, Clinton's performance on crime issues is exceptional. After the Oklahoma City bombing, the Administration began pushing a list of greatly expanded powers for federal law-enforcement agencies -- despite the fact that not one provision in the bill could even arguably have prevented the bombing. Thanks to the Administration's ``anti-terrorism'' initiative, the Federal Government can now, without any need to show probable cause, order credit bureaus to disclose parts of consumer credit records, wiretap radio modem communications, and deport or imprison aliens on the basis of secret evidence. Clinton's original proposal was even worse: it would have greatly expanded the definition of ``terrorism,'' eviscerated restraints on use of the military in domestic law enforcement, and abolished requirements that federal law-enforcement agencies act only within their jurisdiction.
<P>
There is no reason to doubt that a second Clinton Administration would follow a crime policy much like the first: to go as far as politically possible in using crime control as a pretext for constricting privacy and increasing the power of the Federal Government. These policies will not reduce street crime, and they will leave Americans much more vulnerable to the types of crime our Founders most feared: the depredations of a lawless Federal Government.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>S</font> a youth Bill Clinton rejected the segregation of his native South and embraced the series of federal laws that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, education, employment, and voting. Clinton believed that racial discrimination was morally wrong, but his view was not simply a product of reason. To put the President's own hackneyed phrase to perhaps its best use, he ``felt the pain'' of segregation. Thus, while not a civil-rights activist, organizing and demonstrating, Clinton became a race healer. He made a point of associating with blacks, and continued to do so even when black separatism started gaining strength.
<P>
At the Yale Law School, according to David Maraniss's biography, <I>First in His Class</I>, a table in the cafeteria that black law students (including Lani Guinier) claimed as their own sometimes had a white visitor -- Bill Clinton. One reason so few whites sat at this ``black table of solidarity'' is that they didn't know how to ``enter that world.'' Maraniss reports that while at first some blacks stared at Clinton ``as though he was an unwanted interloper,'' he soon won them over through his willingness to ``talk about whatever the black students were talking about, or tell his own tales about life in Arkansas, or joke about how he had not gone to class or read any of his law books.''
<P>
Clinton continued this winning way. As a young law professor at the University of Arkansas, Clinton, writes Maraniss, ``quickly became the friend and champion'' of black students. His ``relaxed style'' was a comfort to blacks in the classroom, and outside it Clinton went the extra mile by tutoring them. The black students nicknamed Clinton ``Wonder Boy.'' Said one, ``It was a miracle the way he was.''
<P>
It has proved a miracle relevant to Clinton's political career. He has always been more than the ordinary Democrat who by virtue of being a Democrat gets most of the ``black vote.'' He has indeed been the Wonder Boy, a white figure who enjoys exceptional black trust. As a result, Clinton has been positioned to do extraordinary things. And since 1992, when he burst onto the national stage, he sometimes has done them.
<P>
In June of that year, Clinton repudiated rap singer Sister Souljah for her comment, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, that ``if black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people? . . . why not kill a white person?'' Clinton said these remarks were ``filled with hatred'' and that ``if you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.'' Sister Souljah's remarks, Clinton added, contributed to a noxious political environment ``of pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.'' There was a strategic calculation in what Clinton did: seeking to demonstrate his willingness to challenge core Democratic constituency groups, the candidate made his comments about Sister Souljah in a speech to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition. But his criticism of her also served to define his ``new covenant'' message in a way consistent with the best principles in American life. Thus, the new covenant was not merely a statement that ``we (whatever color we are) are all in this together,'' as Clinton said elsewhere in 1992, but also a recognition that, all of us being together, there's no place among us for racism of any variety, white or black. Though Jackson defended Sister Souljah against Clinton, many black leaders, including some who had backed presidential runs by Jackson, said Clinton was right to say what he did.
<P>
In late 1993, Clinton gave a speech in Memphis to black pastors. The speech was remarkable for its focus on the cultural problems afflicting black communities -- a taboo subject for white politicians. Clinton was so confident that he could handle this subject and still retain the approval of blacks that he even dared to imagine what Martin Luther King might be saying today -- namely, that ``I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others . . . I fought for freedom but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don't amount to anything. . . . I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.'' Clinton preached to the preachers that ``It is our moral duty to turn [this state of affairs] around,'' adding, ``We have to make our people whole again.''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> use of the first-person plurals, ``our'' and ``we,'' made Clinton at one with his audience and the families they minister to. It was a dramatic demonstration of his solidarity with blacks. And it is this solidarity that has freed Clinton to endorse welfare reform, a project that could hit poor blacks harder than any other group. With the legislation of welfare reform, Clinton has now performed the Democratic equivalent of Richard Nixon's going to China.
<P>
There is not a chance, however, that Clinton will do the same with affirmative action. This, of course, was the great hope of New (and some old) Democrats. Early in 1993, the distinguished historian C. Vann Woodward wrote that Clinton ``rejects . . . racial preference'' and ``makes no separate case for the rights of racial minorities.'' Those have proved words to be eaten. Through 1994, the Clinton Administration was unable to find a racial preference it could not support, whether as a matter of policy or law, and in litigation (notably in the <I>Adarand</I> case and in voting-rights cases) it supported doctrine in effect making a separate case for the rights of minorities. But for the 1994 election results, which put affirmative action in the political dock, Clinton would not have felt compelled to review a single federal program containing preferences. Not that the Administration has greatly diverged from the left-lying affirmative action path it was on, although the press continues to report that Clinton has steered ``a middle course'' on affirmative action.
<P>
In his July 19, 1995, speech announcing the results of the Administration's review of affirmative action -- a speech given at the National Archives to an audience made up largely of civil-rights activists -- Clinton, wishing to ensure Jesse Jackson would not burden him with a primary challenge, announced his intention to ``mend, not end'' affirmative action. While the statement could be construed as a sign of progress -- to say that affirmative action needs ``mending'' is a concession that at least something about it is wrong -- there has over the past year been very little mending of affirmative action, and the only ending of an actual preferential device (two, by my count, have bit the dust) has occurred as a result of litigation. (See ``Don't Mend It, Defend It,'' by <a href="/nationalreview/clinton/therns.html">Abigail Thernstrom</a> .)
In practice, ``mending'' affirmative action has entailed the nurturing of a politics that, as the Democratic Leadership Council recognized in a statement critical of Clinton's policy conclusions, ``divides Americans most dramatically along racial lines,'' making it ``more rather than less difficult to transcend racial difference.'' According to Administration policy, found in policy papers, legal memos, and court filings, minorities need affirmative action, on the one hand, because non-minorities discriminate against them on account of race and, on the other, because their race and ethnicity are in themselves valuable commodities, providing ``diversity.'' Clinton's affirmative-action Presidency has left him unable to say with moral clarity why Louis Farrakhan, who has ascended into a position of black national leadership during the past four years, is wrong on matters of race.
<P>
Notwithstanding his 1992 admonition against pointing fingers across racial lines, Clinton has not been above doing that himself. In late 1993, campaigning in New York City for incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, he accused whites of being unwilling to vote for someone different from them, even though many whites had voted for Dinkins in 1989; in effect, he accused whites of racism. Two months ago, in a speech suggesting (against known evidence) that the black-church burnings were ``fires of [racial] hatred,'' Clinton warned against the raising of ``divisive'' issues during this election year. ``Every time you hear somebody use race or religion as an instrument of division and hatred, speak up against it.'' Subtly but unmistakably, Clinton suggested that anyone who questions affirmative action is using ``race as an instrument of division'' -- is a racist, in sum, no different from those who burn black churches. Republican timidity on the matter suggests that this effort to intimidate is succeeding.
<P>
On welfare Clinton may now be able to call himself a New Democrat. But on race he cannot say that. Instead, he has been aiding and abetting a politics of victimization and racial identity that threatens individual rights, denies the equal protection of the law, and divides the races. Wonder Boy, indeed.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> July 19, 1995, Bill Clinton gave one of the most-watched speeches of his Presidency. With a live television audience tuned in from around the country, he pledged to maintain affirmative-action programs. But he also promised to reform those programs that did not meet the constitutional test laid out by the Supreme Court just a month earlier, in <I>Adarand Constructors</I> v. <I>Pena</I>. ``Mend it, don't end it,'' the President said of affirmative action.
<P>
``Defend it'' would have been a more forthright description of the Administration's response. As Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, put it: ``It is important for us all not to be intimidated by <I>Adarand</I>. We have to take <I>Adarand</I> on.''
<P>
What the Supreme Court did in <I>Adarand</I> was to extend to federal programs its demand that race-based action meet the demanding test of narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest. Such programs would henceforth be subject to ``strict scrutiny,'' the highest level of judicial review.
<P>
Within three weeks of this decision the Administration had launched an all-out offensive to limit the Court-inflicted damage on its program of racial preferences. The first step was a June 28 Justice Department memo, written by Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger and intended to provide ``preliminary legal guidance'' to the general counsels of the executive agencies. The Dellinger memo was followed by a long-delayed White House review of federal affirmative-action programs that the President had ordered in February; written by Christopher Edley Jr. (special counsel to the President) and George Stephanopoulos, it promised ``a candid and balanced description'' of these programs, as well as a set of policy recommendations.
<P>
The Edley report was released the same day the President gave his ``Mend it, don't end it'' speech. Two months later, Deval Patrick testified before a House subcommittee on the proposed Equal Opportunity Act (the Dole - Canady bill), which had been introduced on the heels of the Edley review. And then on February 19, 1996, Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt issued a directive spelling out the implications of <I>Adarand</I> for federal employment. That memo was supplemented by still another on May 22 entitled ``Proposed Reforms to Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement.''
<P>
The Administration had been hard at work. This was a fight from which the President could not run, he had said in a closed-door get-together with House Democrats on February 22, 1995. ``We have to outsmart the Republicans,'' he had declared -- and once five Supreme Court Justices had at least partially tied his hands with the <I>Adarand</I> ruling, his task included outsmarting the Court.
<P>
Only in retrospect was the Dellinger memo a hint of things to come; at the time, it read like a legitimate attempt to put the best face possible on <I>Adarand</I>, emphasizing the limits of the ruling and urging no precipitous action. But Dellinger's quick read of the decision was the Administration's last careful and lawyerly analysis. The Edley report, less than a month later, basically ignored the Supreme Court's holding. A brief on behalf of every federal affirmative-action program (the authors did not recommend eliminating a single one), it put the Administration on record as intending to carry bravely on.
<P>
As Edley and Stephanopoulos described them, these programs were above legal, political, or ethical reproach; the Court's concerns in <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions were thus woefully off base. The plurality in the Supreme Court's 1989 <I>Richmond</I> v. <I>Croson</I> decision had warned of the danger of ``stigmatic harm'' and ``racial hostility.'' Edley and Stephanopoulos spoke of policies that simply offered ``every American a fair chance to achieve success.'' They were a needed tool ``to move us away from a world of lingering biases . . . toward one in which opportunity is equal.'' The voice of these White House aides was, of course, precisely that of the President's. ``Affirmative action has been good for America,'' he said in his July 19 speech. ``When . . . done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration clearly has had a mission: saving the whole panoply of racial preferences that pervades government employment and contracting. That was fully apparent in the Schmidt memos.
<P>
In the first of these memos, <I>Adarand</I> and related decisions are treated as minor annoyances -- roadblocks that require a bit of ingenuity to get around. Schmidt concludes: ``nothing in <I>Adarand</I> requires a retreat.'' What the decision demanded was ``a demonstrable factual predicate'' for an agency's race-conscious actions. Those actions could be justified by statistical evidence indicating minority underrepresentation (a ``lingering effect'' of historic discrimination) or perhaps by ``an agency's operational need for a diverse workforce.'' It encouraged agencies to increase minority participation through race-neutral means, but said that if these failed, then race-conscious means were acceptable.
<P>
<font size=+3>S</font><font size=+1>OME</font> background is needed to understand Schmidt's second memo, which is actually the more interesting of the two. In 1994, Congress had enacted the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), which constituted a bipartisan effort to streamline federal purchases of goods and services, ranging from construction to paper clips. Included was a government-wide extension of two tools that had previously been available only to the Defense Department -- namely, the so-called ``rule of two'' and a bidding preference. The ``rule of two'' allowed the Pentagon to remove a contract from competitive bidding any time there were at least two minority businesses eager to do the work. The bidding preference allowed the Pentagon to award a contract to a minority-owned company as long as the cost was no more than 10 per cent above that of the lowest bidder.
<P>
FASA could not take effect until final implementing regulations were issued -- a process complicated by <I>Adarand</I>. Schmidt's second memo offered a ``model'' for these regulations.
<P>
Once again, the Clinton Administration made clear its commitment to the entire edifice of federal race-conscious programs. The title promised ``Proposed Reforms.'' And yet Schmidt himself said his starting ``premise'' was ``a need for affirmative action in procurement,'' and George Stephanopoulos agreed that ``we want to do everything we can to promote minority contracting.'' Moreover, the memo's stated aim was to create ``a structure for race-conscious procurement . . . in a manner that will survive constitutional scrutiny.''
<P>
The entire report, in fact, can be read as an exercise in deception. The government had an indisputably compelling interest (a Fourteenth Amendment demand) in ``affirmative remedial efforts,'' the memo stated at the outset. Discrimination is a given, remedies thus a necessity -- remedies that are ``affirmative.'' The only issue was whether they were sufficiently ``narrowly tailored'' to meet the second half of the constitutional standard.
<P>
The question of narrow tailoring was thus the memo's focus. And to that end, Schmidt proposed several alleged ``reforms.'' For instance, white firms should be able, with slightly more ease, to prove their eligibility for participation in programs that give small, disadvantaged businesses a break. On its face, a limited but good suggestion; a month earlier, however, the assistant attorney general for civil rights had (with refreshing candor) admitted he was ``not convinced that means anything in practical terms.''
<P>
Likewise, the memo suggested that the usual goals and timetables should be replaced by ``benchmarks'' that would establish the appropriate level of minority contracting in each industry. There would be no fixed, permanent 10 per cent goal for highway construction, in other words. But the benchmarks would be set by determining ``the level of minority contracting that one would reasonably expect to find in a market absent discrimination or its effects.'' In other words, by figuring out how many minority businesses would get what sort of contracts had history been different -- had discrimination never occurred.
<P>
There were two problems with this proposal. The first was the fact that such allegedly exact calculations were the stuff of pseudo-scientific dreams.  The second problem was Schmidt's assumption that a paucity of minority firms in a particular sector of the economy always indicated discrimination or its ``lingering effects.'' Together they meant that procurement officers would continue to set goals (in effect quotas) that seemed ``fair.'' And to meet those goals, as the memo acknowledged, the government could continue to use such race-conscious mechanisms as bidding credits and bonus points for prime contractors who used minority subcontractors for part of the work. There was more, none of which changed the bottom line: <I>Adarand</I>, as the Justice Department had interpreted it, had been a waste of the Supreme Court's breath.
<P>
Times have changed. Preferences cannot survive the court of public opinion. Raw racial exclusion has almost disappeared, and the majority of Americans have never, in any case, viewed discrimination as the remedy for discrimination.
<P>
Federal set-aside programs and federal coercion to ensure the use of minority-owned firms have never been more vulnerable. And yet the Clinton Justice Department is still intent on keeping them safe and sound. Unless the public wakes up to the Administration's unabashed defense of racial preferences, four more years of President Clinton are likely to mean four more years in which such preferences remain alive and very well.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T THE</font> beginning of the twentieth century, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot entered the United States. American Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed on two basic goals: teach the newcomers English and make them Americans. The clear aim was to strengthen our national identity -- to reinforce the <I>unum</I> in <I>E pluribus unum</I> -- by assimilating the new arrivals into American civilization.
<P>
As the twentieth century nears its end, large numbers of immigrants from ethnic groups relatively new to the American melting pot are, once again, entering the United States. Today, however, the American President, William Jefferson Clinton, promotes policies that are directly opposed to the strategies advocated by Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Instead of promoting Americanization and emphasizing the learning of English, the current occupant of the White House favors policies to weaken our national identity -- de facto anti-assimilation measures, anti-English-language initiatives, and an indifference to substantive citizenship training.
<P>
President Clinton and Education Secretary Riley tell us that their goal in supporting bi-lingual education is ``transitional.'' Schools should teach basic subjects in the children's ``primary language,'' so that they do not fall behind in math, science, history, and the like while they are learning English. Education professionals, however -- the people who actually run the schools -- strongly emphasize ``cultural preservation.'' Thus the Los Angeles Unified School District advises teachers ``not to encourage language-minority'' parents to speak English at home, but instead ``to encourage them to strongly promote development of the primary (non-English) language'' in their children. Current law buttresses the bi-lingual establishment by requiring that 75 per cent of all programs for newcomers be taught in the student's native language. This is at odds with proven principles of learning a second language, which is best done by writing and speaking it as much as possible, not simply by attending a one-hour class five days a week.
<P>
Even measured by its own criteria, bi-lingual education is a failure. It neither teaches English well, nor keeps students from falling behind in other subjects. A recent and comprehensive evaluation reported in the major research journal sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English found that ``there is no body of research evidence to support the notion that non-English-speaking children will read, write, and do academic work in English better if they learn to read, write, and do academic work in their home language first.''
<P>
The dismal failure of bi-lingual education to teach children English has led to open revolts by Hispanic parents in New York, California, New Jersey, and Nebraska. In the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, 150 Latino parents organized to fight for English instruction for their children. Sister Kathy Maire, a Roman Catholic nun working with the parents, stated: ``The bottom line is these kids are being robbed of their futures.'' In Los Angeles some 100 Hispanic parents pulled their children out of a local school to protest bi-lingual education. Indeed, a U.S. Department of Education survey of Mexican- and Cuban-American parents revealed that four-fifths opposed teaching their children in Spanish, if this meant that less time would be devoted to English. Unfortunately, the education bureaucracy has a vested interest in keeping children in bi-lingual programs, because as the students ``transition out'' of native-language instruction, the schools lose government funds.
<P>
In this fight the Clinton Administration has from the beginning stood on the side of the bi-lingual establishment. Even before he was elected President, Bill Clinton, in an article in <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I> (October 1992), blasted the Bush Administration for not spending enough money on bi-lingual education. Once in power the Clintonites have not simply advocated more money for existing bi-lingual programs; they have expanded multi-lingual education. For example, the Administration's major education bill, the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, authorized federal funds to develop written grammars for previously oral American Indian and Native Alaskan languages. Thus instead of merely ``preserving'' primary languages, bi-lingual education under Clinton may include inventing what are essentially new written languages.
<P>
For the first time, the congressionally mandated National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), the ``Nation's Report Card,'' will be given in Spanish as well as in English. Deputy Education Secretary Madelein Kunin sent a memorandum to the civil servant in charge of the tests stating that ``excluding'' children whose English is limited violated the Civil Rights Act and ordering that these students be accommodated by providing them with Spanish versions of the math and science tests. The irony in giving the tests for the ``Nation's Report Card'' to American students in a language other than English appears to have gone unnoticed by either the Clinton Administration or the Republican Congress, which has remained mute on this issue. As Jorge Amselle of the Center for Equal Opportunity put it, ``If [the students] ace a history test in Spanish and flunk it in English, it's not going to do them any good when they go to get a job.''
<P>
Although Bill Clinton signed an official-English bill when he was governor of Arkansas, the Clinton Administration has opposed efforts by Republicans and by moderate and conservative Democrats in the 104th Congress to declare English the official language of the United States. The Administration also opposes congressional efforts to stop requiring states to provide ballots in other languages as discrimination against Americans who don't speak English.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, in a brilliant new book, <I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship</I> (to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press next month), chronicles in painful detail the steady diminution of naturalization -- the once meaningful process of immigrants' becoming American citizens. While the ``dumbing down'' of citizenship did not begin on January 20, 1993, it has clearly accelerated under the Clinton Administration. In December 1995 the Administration expanded the use of foreign languages on citizenship tests; four hundred new centers give the test in Spanish. Plans are under way to offer tests in Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> attitude toward the importance of English for American citizenship is reflected in the comments of Jess Nieto, a director of one of the ``community organizations'' authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to give citizenship tests. Nieto declared, ``Many of these people [resident aliens applying for citizenship] have been here a million years. Why should they have to take the test in English?''
<P>
The citizenship tests themselves have been stripped of much of the rich historical, civic, and patriotic content that once made studying for and passing the test a truly gratifying experience in the life of a new American citizen. Even the dignified and moving court ceremony for swearing in new immigrants is no longer mandatory. Besides the INS, over eight hundred organizations are now eligible to give citizenship tests. Leftist advocacy groups such as the Asylum and Refugee Rights Project, Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under the Law, and the Mexican - American Legal Defense and Educational Fund are working closely with the INS. Ironically, activist lawyers who spend their working hours litigating against any legal distinctions between citizens and non-citizens are often running the official process that makes resident aliens American citizens. Even the Heritage of Aztlan Educational and Cultural Foundation -- a group which romanticizes irredentist Mexican claims to the ``lost territories'' of the Southwestern United States -- is busy giving tests in American history and civics to candidates for American citizenship.
<P>
<font size=+3>M</font><font size=+1>EANWHILE</font>, the Clinton Administration has begun a project of instant mass naturalization, Citizenship USA. Hundreds of federal workers from other agencies have been detailed to the INS to process citizenship applications. In one case in California, special personnel worked from dawn to dusk for two months and naturalized sixty thousand resident aliens. According to an article by Ruth Larson in the <I>Washington Times</I>, a career INS official stated that a White House staffer admitted to him, ``Quite frankly, it's 250,000 registered voters who are likely to vote Democratic.''
<P>
Attitudes about citizenship and American identity are revealed in the words and actions of Clinton appointees. For example, Eugene Garcia, Clinton's bi-lingual-education chief from 1993 to 1995, told a conference of bi-lingual educators, ``The border for many is nonexistent. For me, for intellectual reasons, that border shall be nonexistent.'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has suggested that the inspiring Oath of Allegiance, in which new citizens promise to ``absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, . . . support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; . . . bear arms on behalf of the United States; . . . take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: so help me God,'' is ``anachronistic'' and should be changed.
<P>
One of Mrs. Meissner's top political appointees, Executive Associate Commissioner Robert Bach, was the principal author of a Ford Foundation report on immigrant communities in 1993. Bach recommended that non-citizens be permitted, indeed ``encouraged,'' to vote in city and school-board elections. In fact, the terms ``citizen'' and ``citizenship'' are rarely mentioned in the report; instead Bach uses the term ``established resident.'' He is critical of assimilation, suggests that too much ``homogeneity'' may be ``the problem in America,'' and emphasizes that long-established residents should ``accommodate'' the newcomers with multi-lingualism instead of assimilating them into mainstream society. Another of Mrs. Meissner's chief lieutenants, Alexander Alienikoff, has, according to Georgie Anne Geyer, ``argued constantly that it was time no longer to distinguish or differentiate between citizens and legal aliens.''
<P>
The Clinton Administration has unleashed the coercive power of federal agencies  against opponents of its anti-assimilation and multi-lingual policies. Thus on February 24, 1995, after the city council of Allentown, Pennsylvania, voted 6 to 1 to declare English the official language of their city, the city clerk received a call from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) warning him that Allentown could lose federal funds if the city council did not repeal the ordinance. A Clinton appointee, Assistant Secretary Roberta Achtenberg, launched an investigation and suggested that the city's ordinance might violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Twenty-three Congressmen sent a letter to HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros demanding an explanation. Finally, after the city government promised not to implement the ordinance, the inquiry was canceled.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>N</font> August 1995, the chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Clinton appointee Mary Frances Berry, subpoenaed members of the Florida-187 Committee to appear before a Commission hearing on ``racism.'' Mrs. Berry demanded that the group -- which supports a Florida initiative patterned after California's attempt to deny most public benefits to illegal aliens -- turn over all its computer printouts, reports, policy studies, memoranda, and internal documents. JoAnn Peart, a housewife from Delray Beach, one of the individuals subpoenaed, contacted Republican Congressman Mark Foley, who asked the Subcommittee on the Constitution to hold oversight hearings on the Civil Rights Commission's action. A group of Republican congressmen sent a letter to President Clinton stating that the Commission's action was a ``clear violation'' of citizens' ``right to engage in political activities without being intimidated or harassed by a government entity.'' Shortly after this uproar Mary Frances Berry withdrew the subpoenas.
<P>
For the past several decades Americans have had a continuing argument over two visions of the future, an argument that will determine the fate of our national identity. Do we promote English or multi-lingualism? Do we strengthen American citizenship or do we diminish it? Should we be a multi-ethnic nation or a multi-cultural one? A multi-ethnic nation means an America composed of individual citizens belonging to racial and ethnic groups from all over the world. On the other hand, a multi-cultural nation emphasizes group identity, not individual citizenship. It establishes different legal and language ``rights'' for different racial and ethnic groups, rejects assimilation, and erases distinctions between citizens and non-citizens.
<P>
There is no doubt that the Clinton Administration has joined the battle on the side of multi-lingualism and multiculturalism. The words and deeds of Clintonites Achtenberg, Aleinikoff, Bach, Berry, Cisneros, Garcia, Kunin, and Meissner are clear and consistent: expand official multi-lingualism wherever possible; water down the substantive meaning of citizenship; blur distinctions between citizens and non-citizens; advocate voting by non-citizens; and use Federal Government power to harass opponents of these policies.
<P>
Recently, Congress has started to challenge the Administration. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R., La.) succeeded in cutting bi-lingual education. Congressmen Toby Roth (R., Wisc.), Randy Cunningham (R., Calif.), and John Porter (R., Ill.) and Senator Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) have introduced legislation strengthening the use of English. On August 1, a bill making English the official language of the U.S. and allowing states to eliminate multilingual ballots passed the House. Despite these efforts, the multi-lingual/multi-cultural infrastructure will remain intact. For example, Congressman Roth's initiative to eliminate bi-lingual education is stalled in the House, and the Senate will almost certainly restore multi-lingual ballots when it votes on ``official English'' in September. If the bill passes, a veto is expected. Most importantly, a serious and sustained intellectual and moral argument against the continuing assault on American national identity has not yet been heard. In the final analysis, the struggle between multi-ethnic America and multi-cultural America will be won by the side that is able to articulate an intellectual and moral argument that resonates with the American people.
<P>
The Clinton Administration and their multi-lingualist allies have not made a compelling case for their radical new vision of America, but they have largely succeeded in scaring off and intimidating potential opposition. Their strategy is name calling -- denounce opponents of official multi-lingualism as ``mean-spirited,'' ``racists,'' and ``bigots.'' Thus the American Civil Liberties Union characterizes opposition to official multi-lingualism in terms of ``hate mongering'' and ``fostering bigotry and intolerance.''
<P>
No wonder opponents of official multi-lingualism have been hesitant to make this a major issue, knowing they will be vilified as ``racists'' and ``bigots.'' My guess, however, is that the great silent majority of Americans from all ethnic and racial backgrounds is waiting -- indeed hungering -- to hear the voice of multi-ethnic America challenge the multi-lingual/multi-cultural forces and dislodge them from the moral high ground.
<P>
This voice of multi-ethnic America would tell us: We the People of the United States, a self-governing and free people, have a moral right to transmit our way of life and our national heritage to future generations of Americans. Fluency in English is essential for full participation in our society. To tell newcomers to America otherwise is to lie to them. To be an American citizen is a privilege, not a right. To cheapen citizenship and blur the boundaries between citizens and non-citizens is to mock the sacrifices that have sustained our nation for more than two hundred years. If we don't take citizenship seriously we don't take our constitutional democracy seriously.
<P>
Therefore, we should establish English as our official language, eliminate bi-lingual education and multi-lingual ballots, and end the corruption of our naturalization process. Moreover, as people on both sides of the immigration debate -- including Linda Chavez, John Miller, Dan Stein, and the late Barbara Jordan -- have suggested, it is time to launch a new civic integration effort, similar to the Americanization initiatives earlier this century. Nothing could be more welcoming and inclusive than fostering English and teaching the responsibilities of citizenship to newcomers. Those of us whose parents or grandparents came through Ellis Island at the turn of the century are particularly grateful that Presidents Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson advocated Americanization, instead of multi-lingualism and multi-culturalism.
<P>
Opposition to official multi-lingualism does not mean that Americans should not learn foreign languages, or that we are not free to speak whatever language we want, or that languages other than English cannot be used in places such as courts and hospitals. It does not mean ``English only.'' It means that English should be the <I>official</I> language of <I>public</I> business in our liberal democracy.
<P>
Yes, as with people everywhere, there is bigotry among us. However, the genius of America is that we have worked to overcome unfair discrimination and irrational prejudice. To make the learning of English a priority and to strengthen the substance of citizenship does not mean we are ``racists'' and ``bigots'' -- it means that we take our national heritage and our democracy seriously.
<P>
It is the advocates of bi-lingual education who have prevented Latino kids from advancing. It is a patronizing establishment that is stealing their keys to the American dream.
<P>
The position advanced by the multicultural establishment amounts to a bluff. It is at odds with the feelings and instincts both of the American majority and of the minorities that these policies are allegedly designed to help. What is needed is an open discussion of the facts and values in question. Once that happens, the bluff will be called and the great American public will demand that we end official multi-lingualism, eliminate bi-lingual education and foreign language ballots, take naturalization seriously, and, in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, launch a new campaign for Americanization and civic integration.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>S THIS</font> country to remain the United States of America, pursuing the course of success as charted by the Founders, or are we resigned to watch a different type of country emerge in its place? That is the question Bob Dole should be asking his fellow citizens.
<P>
The spectacle of someone like me, an immigrant, who is also a recent arrival on the political scene, offering advice to America's senior professional politician is one of concern to me. No doubt, after nearly fifty years as a professional pianist, I would be startled if someone who apparently began lessons just a few years ago proposed a different way of playing. But then, my ``lessons'' in politics began at the age of eight, when German troops occupied Budapest.
<P>
It is, thus, of even greater concern to me that the Dole campaign -- the means by which to forestall the alteration-beyond-recognition of this miracle called America -- appears glued to the bottom of a hole in the ground. The other side continues to set the agenda; we remain on the defensive.
<p>
It is in this moment of despair that I request your attention, Senator Dole. One might think: A look at you, a look at the alternative would be sufficient to get you about 85 per cent of the popular vote. Alas, it is not sufficient. What the campaign needs is a different perspective. The time for traditional strategies which secure the Irish vote, the Jewish vote, the union vote, the senior-citizen vote, the black vote, the Southern vote, the women's vote, has passed. The time has come to seek the <I>American</I> vote.
<P>
Notwithstanding thirty years of concerted effort by the other side to subdivide us into irreconcilable groups, most of us still believe that we are, first and last, Americans.
<P>
It is easy to overlook the simple and obvious, precisely because you, Senator Dole, ``hold these truths to be self-evident.'' But people in Seattle and San Francisco, in San Antonio and Fort Myers, in Topeka, New London, St. Joseph -- even in Washington, D.C. -- would love to be reminded by you that this nation was founded on a set of principles which reflect the most thoughtful deliberation on the human condition ever undertaken. Talk to them about the thousands of years it had taken to establish equality before the law for every individual, now threatened by the ever-increasing demand for group rights; they need to realize that <I>group rights signal the end of individual rights</I>. Explain that one cannot ``almost'' guarantee private property, that its sanctity is the cornerstone of all civilization. They know the strength of your sentiments about judges who legislate from the bench; add to this the reminder that separation of powers -- not permitting the same people to make, interpret, and enforce the law -- is the fragile membrane protecting us from dictatorship. You might add, too, that you agree with the Founders, who envisioned no role in education for the Federal Government but who most certainly charged it with responsibility for the common defense.
<P>
Americans would love to hear you say that you will move to dismantle those regulatory and judicial straitjackets which are choking tolerance and voluntarism. Above all, reassure them that people who say ``In God we trust'' are echoing, not violating, the Founders' intent.
<P>
The language the Founders spoke was English; their deeply held beliefs came from the Old and New Testaments. Yet they benefited not only those whom the Founders represented but, in uncommon measure, those who arrived later, speaking different languages and desiring the freedom to live by their different beliefs. Above all, they bestowed upon their posterity the incomparable blessings of a polity in which the peaceful transition of power is the norm.
<P>
The other side will point to its standardized list of grievances aimed at the Founders. You might remind them that the founding principles were but a road map to guide us toward an ever-improving future. The map was based largely on the English legacy, which -- like all others -- was stained with blood. But unlike all others, it was from the start striving for a justice which cannot be bought or sold; for freedom on the high seas and in people's minds; for decency in human conduct and for honorable compromise in place of strife. We ought to continue speaking the language of this legacy. English has given us the word <I>fairness</I>. No other language has yet come up with even a translation of this word.
<P>
Americans may know, but will be glad to hear you say, where your ideas have originated. This would also create an opportunity to discuss where the other side obtained its. By ``other side'' I do not mean true Democrats: indeed, many of <I>them</I> might seize the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer to those whose ideas clearly derive from the opposing doctrine.
<P>
This doctrine has worn many labels -- Fascism, Bolshevism, National Socialism, Communism, Trotskyism, Social Democracy, Maoism, and present-day so-called Liberalism -- but all stand for some variation of socialist philosophy. The practices were developed in the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin School for Behavior Control, priding itself in such stellar graduates as Hitler and Stalin.
<P>
Nothing even remotely comparable in violence is contemplated by latter-day disciples: the current approach is low-key, sophisticated. Your recent encounter with tobacco, Senator, was a measure of its success. Tobacco, of course, has long been selected for an experiment in incremental behavior control. The process begins with an eminently reasonable suggestion, such as setting aside a few tables in restaurants, a few rows in airplanes. No one could possibly object. Semi-scientific ``evidence'' follows and selective name-calling commences. A <I>crescendo</I> is generated in the public discourse, leading to public hysteria, as the selected target is declared the dragon to be slain at all cost. As with every other item on the agenda, we are never told where the campaign intends to end. We sit in Edgar Allan Poe's cell, helplessly watching as the four walls and the ceiling close in on us.
<P>
By now, the targets, methods, and slogans of the other side have achieved such perfection (they <I>appear</I> so reasonable, compassionate, equitable) that exposing their true origins, along with the destruction that invariably follows in their wake, is the only way for our side to win. Lead us on to a winning course, Senator Dole. If they say, ``Character does not matter -- issues matter,'' tell them that <I>principles</I> matter even more. Serve notice that henceforth issues will be discussed first as they relate to our founding principles. Thus, the issue is not affirmative action, but equality before the law; not cutting off immigration, but inviting only those whose desire to become American; not the level of funding for Goals 2000, but restating where government has, and where it has not, a role to perform. Take the lead, and watch candidates -- and voters -- line up behind you.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>MMIGRATION</font>  experts generally agree that the Clinton Administration has devoted  more attention to immigration than either of its two Republican predecessors. Mr. Clinton's policies, however, tend to be reactive, and he always has at least two reactions: his initial public statement (determined largely by public-opinion polls, which show support for restrictions), and then the actual policy (as determined by his advisors and the various special interests they represent).
<P>
Let's begin with a look at Clinton's record on illegal immigration, since that is a major focus of his re-election campaign, particularly in California, a must-win state. Less than three months after taking office Clinton sent to Congress his Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which included cutting 93 Border Patrol positions. Four months later, Clinton responded to pressure from California Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (who was gearing up for re-election) by giving a speech in which he proclaimed that ``our borders leak like a sieve'' and urged that $45.1 million be spent to beef up the Border Patrol, including six hundred new agents. He failed to mention that the House had already approved an additional $60 million for the Border Patrol, or that the Senate Appropriations Committee had approved an additional $45 million.
<P>
In September 1993, the Border Patrol chief in El Paso, Silvestre Reyes, proved, on his own initiative, that illegal immigration could be reduced by up to 75 per cent, without a massive increase in money or personnel, by focusing on deterrence instead of apprehension. The Administration, apparently incensed that an employee would dare to be innovative without prior approval, ostracized Reyes and dismissed his hugely successful strategy as unworkable in other border areas. During the next few months, because of California's Proposition 187, Sen. Feinstein's neck-and-neck race with Republican challenger Michael Huffington, and Democrat Kathleen Brown's floundering bid to unseat Gov. Pete Wilson, the Administration was motivated to come up with its own plan to curb illegal immigration in San Diego. Thus, on October 1, 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno unveiled the multi-million-dollar Operation Gatekeeper, heralded as an El Paso-type deterrence strategy, but actually more like the old (and unsuccessful) cat-and-mouse apprehension strategy.
<P>
Clinton repeatedly holds up Operation Gatekeeper as proof that he is more serious than Republicans about controlling illegal immigration. Border Patrol statistics, however, show that the number of illegal aliens apprehended in San Diego actually <I>increased</I> in all but three months of the first year and a half of Gatekeeper, rather than declining by the 70 per cent or so that Administration officials had promised.
<P>
These statistics presented something of a problem for the Administration until April 1996, when apprehensions in San Diego suddenly began to plummet. Two months later, the Administration was facing allegations that Border Patrol officials were falsifying arrest records to get the numbers down.
<P>
The Clinton Administration's record on political asylum is similar. During his first presidential campaign, Clinton berated George Bush for the latter's policy of returning Haitian boat people to Haiti for asylum interviews. Clinton pledged to provide a safe haven for the fleeing Haitians. Soon after the election, however, media reports that Haitians were building large numbers of boats to take advantage of his generosity spurred an angry public reaction. He immediately announced that he would maintain the Bush policy. This was only the first of many Clinton flip-flops on Haiti.
<P>
And then came the Cuban rafters. First, Clinton directed that their asylum claims be screened on board the Coast Guard ships that picked them up. When the ships filled up, Clinton directed that the Cubans be diverted to Guantanamo for asylum interviews. When Guantanamo began to fill up, with no end in sight, Clinton made a deal with Fidel Castro: the United States would admit a <I>minimum</I> of twenty thousand Cuban immigrants each year if Castro would agree to halt the outflow of rafters. Attorney General Reno announced that no Cubans would be admitted to the United States directly from Guantanamo (this was supposed to entice them to leave Guantanamo and return home voluntarily). The vast majority of Guantanamo Cubans are now settled in Miami -- after being transported directly from Guantanamo.
<P>
Seven months into his term, Clinton proposed legislation that included expedited exclusion for frivolous asylum claimants, an increase in INS asylum personnel, and various anti-smuggling provisions. But it didn't take long for the President to succumb to pressure from immigrant-advocacy, refugee-rights, and lawyers' groups and abandon the legislative package in favor of a watered-down package of administrative reforms that would have had little impact except for a provision that decouples the work permit from the asylum-application process.
<P>
For most of the past four years, the Administration has spoken about the need to reform the asylum system and reduce fraudulent applications. In most cases these statements have come in reaction to the latest crisis: Haiti, Cuba, the World Trade Center bombing, the <I>Golden Venture</I> incident (Clinton promised that the Chinese arriving on that ship would be swiftly deported, but many still are languishing in U.S. jails). But all the while, it has been broadening the asylum system to advance its social agenda. Under U.S. law, asylum is for people facing <I>state-sponsored political persecution</I>, but we now grant asylum, for example, to women facing genital mutilation. The latest Administration proposal reportedly is to grant asylum to aliens who are HIV positive (even though such aliens are not legally permitted to immigrate to this country).
<P>
Finally, there is President Clinton's record on legal immigration. In June 1995, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended a modest cut in legal immigration and the elimination of some extended-family immigration categories. President Clinton immediately endorsed the recommendations as ``consistent with my own views'' and added that they ``are pro-family, pro-work, pro-naturalization.'' Both Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Tex.) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) modeled their immigration bills on the Commission's recommendations, believing logically enough that they would encounter little resistance after Clinton's enthusiastic endorsement.
<P>
Unfortunately, Barbara Jordan died before the Smith and Simpson bills reached the floor, allowing Clinton to renege on his endorsement without risking a Jordan tongue-lashing (one Commission staffer told me he's glad he's not the one who will have to explain Clinton's reversal to Miss Jordan on the other side of the Pearly Gates). So, during the Senate Judiciary Committee markup of the Simpson bill, Attorney General Reno and INS Commissioner Meissner personally lobbied senators to support an amendment by Sen. Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.) to split the legislation into one bill on illegal immigration and one on legal, thus effectively killing any chance for legal-immigration reform in the Senate. Two days before the final House vote on the Smith bill, President Clinton sealed the fate of legal-immigration reform by announcing his support for an amendment by Reps. Dick Chrysler (R., Mich.), Howard Berman (D., Calif.), and Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) to eliminate from the bill the reductions in legal immigration.
<P>
In sum, the Clinton Administration has rejected the one proven strategy for controlling illegal immigration, broadened the grounds for asylum, and killed legal-immigration reform.
<P>
(One final note: If you did not find your favorite Clinton immigration flip-flop here, I apologize -- the list was so long I had to pick and choose.)

<FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT><font size=+1>ORE</font> than a thousand people have died and millions have had to flee their homes, the wires have reported, during recent flooding of the Yangtze River. By historic standards this is a modest flood. Tens of thousands drown every few years in Yangtze floods, and there have been cases when millions died from the uncontrolled waters of China's largest river spilling its banks.
<P>
Lord knows the Communist dynasty ruling in Peking has many crimes to account for, but attempting to tame the waters of the Yangtze to save its citizens from those deadly floods surely does not rank among them. Yet the Clinton Administration has given extraordinarily high priority to sabotaging the financing of the Three Gorges Dam, China's $12-billion effort to control the floods. To save fresh-water dolphins, Siberian cranes, and picturesque rugged scenery, the Administration has worked assiduously to stop the project. Samuel Berger, deputy National Security Advisor, intervened with the supposedly independent Ex-Im Bank to stop commercial credits for it. As a result, Caterpillar and other U.S. companies seeking to sell equipment in competition with Japanese and European manufacturers have been handicapped, and the cost of building the dam increased. Behind the scenes the Administration also threatened to use its veto power at the World Bank and other international agencies to prevent them from lending money for the Three Gorges project.
<P>
Now, there may be legitimate criticisms of the design of the Three Gorges dam. It may be Stalinist gargantuism. Maybe a design with several smaller dams would have been better? Maybe the scenery and endangered species could have been accommodated to a  greater degree, while still providing flood control and electricity? Such questioning of detail would be one thing. But the U.S. position under the Clinton Administration has been one of outright hostility to the aims of the Yangtze project, reflecting a humanity-hating environmentalism that dwells on possible dangers to birds and fish while cavalierly disregarding the needs of tens of millions of people. This extreme brand of environmentalism pervades the Clinton Administration.
<P>
Indeed, its ``integrating'' this environmentalism into all aspects of government has been a major internal goal of the Clinton Administration. In foreign policy, for example, this has meant creating a new under-secretary position for environmental affairs at the Department of State, a position given to Green ex-Senator Timothy Wirth; designating a senior officer at each embassy as ``environmental point person''; and identifying environmentalist doctrine as part of the United States vital interests. A memorandum from Secretary of State Warren Christopher dated February 14 to all embassies and bureaus of the State Department said that ``environmental concerns'' will henceforth be a key component of U.S. foreign policy. Environmental issues are to be ``integrated'' into ``bureau and mission program plans,'' into ``trip plans,'' and into ``talking points for bilateral meetings involving the President and other senior officials.'' In short, every U.S. official is under orders to become an environmentalist scold.
<P>
One hopes that the vast majority of U.S. officials will just go through the motions, generating the usual statements about recycling, energy conservation, ozone-layer protection, dolphin protection, and suchlike, and inserting them into their memoranda. But there has been a steady entrenchment of this stuff even as the bits and pieces of science underpinning it are demonstrated to be junk.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>AKE</font> that mother of all scares, global warming. Simply put, there isn't any global warming. It isn't happening, according to the most sophisticated temperature measurement by balloon and satellite. There's a lot of theory and many fancy computer modelings about why it should be happening. But it just isn't there on the thermometers.
<P>
So now we have parts of the Clinton Administration engaging in Statistical Fraud 101. Any time series of a phenomenon like average temperature by year will bump up and down, and elementary junk science yields a handy means of ``proving'' an upward trend. Search a series for a couple of low years and start off with those; then cut off your trend line when you've got a couple of high years. The global-warming junkmeisters at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just last month did that in an article in Nature magazine using temperature data from 1963 to 1987. Given that 1964 was extraordinarily cold and 1987 very hot, these cheerleaders for Al Gore produced a good-looking uptrend.
<P>
Of course when you include the data from a few years before 1963 and the years since 1987 -- as Patrick Michaels, a University of Virginia climatologist, quickly did -- you get what every reputable calculation of the thermometer data shows, which is that there is no up-trend.
<P>
More recently, the Administration made a major shift leftward to embrace a canon of environmentalist fundamentalism that it had previously found too hot politically -- mandatory limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Green Czar Timothy Wirth announced a new U.S. policy of mandatory limits on carbon-dioxide emissions at a press conference in Geneva July 16 saying the United States was proposing a ``radical'' international accord: ``What we want is a binding target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that is agreed on internationally.'' This radical approach has never been the subject of any reasoned Administration statement or testimony, let alone the subject of major study by a serious scientific panel. Indeed, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study a couple of years ago said that if global warming does occur humanity can adapt, since the computer-forecast changes in climate are similar in magnitude to natural changes. But the Administration is going by green-faith, and science is useful to it only insofar as it supports that faith.
<P>
By pushing an international accord on suppressing greenhouse gases, evangelists of environmentalism such as Mr. Wirth are able to take the huge issues of constraining our power stations and industries out of domestic policy forums. If the accord is agreed to in Geneva, then it gains international legitimacy and opponents at home are disparaged as ``flying in the face of world opinion and advocating that we flout international law.''
<P>
At the same time that users of the carbon fuels of coal, oil, and gas are under pressure from the threatened mandatory international controls driven by the warming scare, the nuclear-power industry is not being allowed to dispose of its wastes. The Clinton Department of Energy, under environmentalist influence, is stalling on the opening of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear-waste repository in Nevada with years' more studies of possible seismic and other dangers. What was supposed to open in 1998 now cannot open before 2010, the Administration says.
<P>
Nuclear power plants have such a good safety record in operation that their opponents rely on hypothetical problems of waste disposal to stop new plants and to get existing ones closed. And so high-level wastes are accumulating onsite year by year at a hundred nuclear plants around the country because the Administration won't open the long-term repository that has been built in Nevada.
<P>
Meanwhile the green assault on synthetic chemicals is being pushed within the Environmental Protection Agency in a bold move to dispense with a hitherto unchallenged part of science -- the EPA proposes to simply omit from it as cancer-test guidelines the test of statistical significance -- the classic scientific tool for measuring the possibility that study results reflect chance rather than a regular association. As the newsletter <I>EPA WATCH</I> reported: ``Reducing the role of statistical significance or eliminating it altogether, could open the door for EPA to drastically expand the number of substances subject to environmental regulation.'' The newsletter might have added: and allow the EPA to regulate in an even more arbitrary fashion than now -- at home and abroad.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1992</font>, the economy grew by 2.7 per cent. Candidate Bill Clinton described that as ``the worst economic performance in fifty years.'' In 1995 the economy grew by around 2 per cent. Yet in this January's State of the Union message, the President said the economy is ``the healthiest in thirty years.'' So on which, if either, occasion was Bill Clinton telling the truth?
<P>
By every conceivable measure of income, output, or productivity, the economy has performed poorly on Clinton's watch, particularly in comparison with what Bob Bartley dubbed ``the seven fat years'' of 1983 to 1989.
<P>
<b>Gross domestic product:</b> Real GDP, the most comprehensive measure of the economy's output, grew by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.9 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Productivity:</b> Growth of output per hour in the non-farm business sector averaged only 0.5 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department figures on ``multifactor productivity'' show the ratio of capital to labor falling in 1993 - 94, which inevitably slows the growth of productivity, real wages, and family incomes.
<P>
<b>Real disposable income:</b> After-tax personal income rose by only 2.3 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 3.5 per cent in 1983 - 89.
Real labor compensation: Real hourly wages and benefits rose by 7 per cent in 1981 - 88, but were virtually flat from 1988 to 1995.
<P>
<b>Employment:</b> As measured by the household survey, employment grew by only 1.9 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Measured by an alternative survey of business (which may count the same workers twice), payroll employment grew by 2.6 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, but that too was down from 3 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
<b>Labor force:</b> The supply of new workers slowed to 0.8 per cent a year in 1993 - 95, down from 1.8 per cent in 1983 - 89. Demographics can't begin to explain this huge and sudden drop in the willingness to look for work, but disincentives in our tax and transfer payments can.
<P>
<b>Savings:</b> Gross private savings amounted to only 14.6 per cent of GDP in 1993 - 95, down from 17.2 per cent in 1983 - 89.
<P>
Was this trip really necessary?
<P>
Even in the very few areas where the economy appears to have fared relatively well, it still fails to measure up to the lofty standards set by the Reagan years. The Clinton Administration points with pride to growth of real exports, which did indeed rise at an 8.3 per cent rate over the past three years. But imports grew faster -- at a 10 per cent rate. In 1983 - 89, by contrast, real exports grew by 9.4 per cent a year, and imports by 8.6 per cent.
<P>
One statistic almost summarizes all the rest: Median family income fell by more than 5 per cent from 1989 through 1994 (the latest available figure). By contrast, median family income rose by 12.6 per cent from 1982 to 1989. These figures are before taxes, so they understate the actual drop in living standards following the 1993 increase in taxes on incomes, Social Security benefits and gasoline.
<P>
Income statistics for 1995 and 1996 are unlikely to look much better. Real wages were flat in 1995, and employment nearly so (by January 1996, employment was only 0.4 per cent higher than a year earlier). Wages picked up a bit in early 1996, but so did inflation. The increase in consumer prices averaged 3.6 per cent in the first half of this year, wiping out nominal wage increases in the process. Recent employment gains have slowed to 1.5 per cent or less, compared with the same month a year ago.
<P>
Because employment grew at about the same slow 2 per cent pace as the economy in the past three years, it follows that output per worker (productivity) must have grown very slowly. Indeed, productivity growth averaged only 0.6 per cent in 1993 - 95, down from 1.6 in 1983 - 89. There is no mystery at all about why real wages have stagnated in the past three years, despite a flood of misinformed news reports on that topic. Real output per worker and real income per worker are just two different ways of looking at the same thing. If we don't produce more, there won't be more to go around.
<P>
The Clinton Administration would much prefer to reduce all these uncomfortable economic comparisons to a single statement -- namely, the claim that the President himself has personally ``created'' nearly ten million jobs. The reason for that single-minded focus is obvious: ten million new jobs sounds like an impressive number. In fact, it isn't. If employment had grown as rapidly in 1993 - 95 as it did in 1983 - 89, the economy would have generated two million <I>more</I> jobs than it did between the end of 1992 and 1995.
<P>
There are two ways the unemployment rate can go down. One is for employers to offer more jobs. The other is for fewer people to go looking for jobs (to be listed as unemployed you must be looking for a job and not finding one). As it happens, surprisingly few people have been looking for work. Growth in the labor force has slowed to a crawl. This puts severe limits on future employment growth, and therefore on economic growth as well. And it is one link, but only one, between the decidedly mediocre growth of output and income and the 1993 increase in marginal tax rates.
<P>
The 1996 Economic Report of the President complains, ``some claimed these tax rate increases [e.g., in 1993] would do severe harm to the economy by creating disincentives for individuals to work and save. Again, these forecasts turned out to be false, just as did the earlier supply-side forecasts of rapid growth from tax reductions.'' It is difficult to imagine what numbers the President's economists have been looking at. If 3.9 per cent economic growth from 1983 to 1989 did not constitute ``rapid growth from tax reductions,'' then what are we to make of 2.3 per cent growth from Mr. Clinton's higher tax rates?
<P>
When it comes to ``disincentives for individuals to work,'' look at what the Economic Report itself says: ``The increase in the overall labor-force-participation rate has slowed since the late 1980s. . . . The stagnant participation rate has been one of the more enduring aspects of this expansion.'' Many secondary earners, mostly women, dropped out of the job market after the counterproductive, revenue-losing tax-rate increases of 1990 and 1993. The percentage of families with two or more earners, for example, dropped to 56.4 per cent in 1993 from 58.2 per cent in 1989, while the percentage with zero workers rose. This should come as no surprise. Assuming the first earner makes more than $140,000, the very first dollar of a second earner's income is now taxed at the same demoralizing 36 - 40 per cent rate as the first earner's last dollar.
<P>
More and more people are also retiring earlier. This too was quite predictable. The extra 1993 tax on Social Security benefits severely punishes older people who keep working, or who made the mistake of having saved enough to afford a modest retirement. The increase in the already punitive estate tax also undermines a major incentive for working and saving in later years.
<P>
In 1993, the earned-income tax credit increased the share of the loot given to those with incomes well above the poverty level. That too discouraged additional work and additional workers. Marginal tax rates on any extra income are now 50 - 75 per cent for two-thirds of EITC recipients.
<P>
The reduction in the supply of willing workers is what kept the measured unemployment rate low, despite the fact that employment has grown by only 1.3 per cent a year since 1991, down from 2.4 per cent in 1983 - 89. Labor Department demographers had forecast that the labor force would grow by 1.3 per cent a year in the 1990s, but it has not even grown by 1 per cent. If the number of job seekers had grown as rapidly as the demographic experts suggested, there would be a lot more people looking for work, and the unemployment rate would now be well above 8 per cent. If the labor force had grown as rapidly as in the Eighties, the unemployment rate would exceed 11 per cent.
<P>
What about ``disincentives . . . to save''? Since tax rates went up in 1993, personal saving has dropped to 4.2 per cent of after-tax income, down from 5.9 per cent in 1992. Measured in constant 1992 dollars, real personal saving was only $223.8 billion in 1995, compared with $310.5 billion ten years earlier. Increased tax rates on high-income individuals and on corporations directly reduced the amount of disposable income left to save, as well as reducing incentives to save.
<P>
Apologists for Clinton's economic policies often blame Alan Greenspan for the sluggish growth of output and income. Has the Fed been discouraging growth through excessively tight monetary policy? Hardly. Short-term interest rates have been much lower in the past three years than they ever were in 1983 - 89, in both nominal and real terms. In other words, the Fed was less accommodating in the 1980s than today, but we had higher growth then.
<P>
By the time of the November election, living standards will have gone nowhere but down for seven years. This is unprecedented. In the 49 years that figures on median family income have been collected, they never before declined for seven years. The worst economic performance in fifty years, as Mr. Clinton used to say, is arguably right now.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> conventional wisdom is that the Republican Party is the party of the rich, while the Democrats represent the working class. But under Ronald Reagan's policies working-class Americans prospered, and under Clintonomics, the working class has lost ground. Only the rich have prospered on Clinton's watch.
<P>
During the 1980s, each uptick in the share of total income going to the wealthy was trumpeted on the front page of every major newspaper as evidence that the Reaganomics had created an era of greed and income disparity. And indeed, the wealthy were better off. The share of total income going to the top 20 per cent of households rose by 2.4 per cent, and the share going to the top 5 per cent rose by 1.9 per cent during the Reagan Administration. Yet during just the first two years of the Clinton Administration (the latest data go only through 1994), the top 20 per cent increased their share of the income pie as much as they did during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration. And the top 5 per cent have done even better, increasing their share of total income by 2.5 per cent.
<P>
In fact, the share of total income gained by the top 20 per cent of households hit an all-time high in 1994 (49.1 per cent), as did the share going to the top 5 per cent (21.2 per cent). The top quintile's share of total income was significantly lower in every year of the Reagan Administration than in either of Clinton's first two. In 1988, the year under Reagan when the rich did the best, the top quintile received 46.3 per cent of total income and the top 5 per cent received 18.3 per cent. In other words, income gains in the 1980s were more evenly divided among the income classes than has been the case in the 1990s.
<P>
How can this be? Clinton's first priority after taking office was to raise taxes on the rich precisely in order to reduce income inequality. This is why the very centerpiece of his economic program was an increase in the top tax rate from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent -- to force the rich to pay more. Yet all the evidence thus far shows that income inequality became worse following the tax increase. Nevertheless after release of the latest income data, the <I>Washington Post</I> and other media outlets editorialized against the Republican Congress's proposed tax cut because it ``would add to what is already so disturbing a trend'' of greater income inequality.
<P>
At least Reagan could argue that although the rich got richer, so did everyone else. Real median family income (in 1994 dollars) rose from $36,825 when he took office to $40,890 by the time he left. Furthermore, the average real income of those in the bottom quintile of households rose from $7,954 to $8,391, and the income of those in the second lowest quintile rose from $18,856 to $20,797. The third and fourth quintiles also saw significant increases.
<P>
By contrast, median family income has been flat during the Clinton Administration. During its first two years, real median family income averaged $38,343, down from $38,632 in 1992 and well below the level when Reagan left office. The income of the bottom quintile has averaged $7,681 and that of the second quintile has averaged $19,176. In 1992 these groups averaged $7,698 and $19,205, respectively. However, the average income of the top quintile rose from $96,240 in 1992 to $105,945 in 1994, and that of the top 5 per cent went from $152,751 to $183,044.
<P>
Other measures of income also show that the non-rich have not benefited at all from Clinton's policies. Workers, for example, are no better off today than they were when Clinton took office. In January 1993 real average weekly earnings for private-sector workers were $253.76 (in 1982 dollars). In May 1996, the most recent month for which there are data, real earnings were $253.80. That works out to a real pay increase of just one cent per week for every year Clinton has been in office.
<P>
History teaches us that it is virtually impossible to reduce the share of income going to the wealthy by raising their taxes. The reason is that the negative economic effects of raising marginal tax rates reduce everyone's incomes. The only way to raise the share of income going to the non-wealthy is by increasing the rate of economic growth. The source of the wealthy's gains during the Clinton years has been lower interest rates and a strong stock market.
<P>
Workers, meanwhile, have seen their incomes squeezed by Clinton's policies -- the prosperity has not trickled down. Only an aggressive pro-growth policy of supply-side tax cuts and less regulation will improve their living standards. Contrary to conventional wisdom, throughout American history a rising tide really has lifted all boats. Clinton's austerity has succeeded in lifting only the yachts of the Kennedys and the Rockefellers.

<FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT><font size=+1>RODUCTIVITY</font> growth has been only 0.5 per cent a year on Bill Clinton's watch, the lowest rate through an Administration since Herbert Hoover. Worker productivity since 1993 has been only about one-third the rate under Ronald Reagan (1.3 per cent) and has even been well below the rate under George Bush (0.9 per cent).
<P>
We care about productivity rates because this is what drives the real wages of workers. Given the anemic productivity rates since 1993, it should hardly be surprising that the growth of average real (inflation-adjusted) labor compensation under Clinton has also been very low. This is the primary reason, even with low unemployment and inflation, why many Americans are concerned about their economic future. This is the primary pocketbook issue on which Clinton's record is vulnerable.
<P>
The average rate of worker-productivity growth has declined somewhat unevenly for thirty years, interrupted only by a temporary upswing during the Reagan years. The reasons for this long-term decline are not fully understood by economists, let alone policymakers, but the following conditions are at least partly responsible:
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Too many young workers have low job skills, despite a long-term increase of real spending per student by over 30 per cent a decade. The average composite SAT score peaked in 1963, declined almost continuously through 1980, and has since been roughly stable.<br>
2. Taxes as a percentage of GDP have increased by about 5 points beginning with the Vietnam War and the expansion of the welfare state in the mid 1960s.<br>
3. The costs of health, safety, and environmental regulation and of civil litigation increased sharply beginning in the early 1970s.<br>
4. The net national saving rate has declined sharply over the past 15 years, reflecting the combination of a decline in the private saving rate and an increase in the federal deficit. The private sector has been able to maintain a somewhat higher investment rate only by a substantial increase in borrowing from foreigners.</blockquote>
<P>
President Clinton did not create these conditions, but he should be judged by what, if anything, he has done to alleviate them.
<P>
As it has turned out, the Clinton Administration and, more generally, the national Democratic Party, has been an enemy of the very types of policies that are necessary to increase productivity growth. Let me count the ways:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In response to the teachers' unions, Clinton has opposed school vouchers, even in the District of Columbia (where his daughter attends a private school). In response to the industrial unions, Clinton proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage (which reduces the opportunity for on-the-job training) and opposed a bill that would have relaxed the restriction on ``quality circles'' in non-union firms.<br>
 -- At almost every decision point, Clinton has sided with the current beneficiaries of federal spending rather than with present and future taxpayers. Both Bush and Clinton addressed the deficit more by increasing taxes than by reducing domestic spending. As a consequence, the top marginal rate on earnings was increased from 28 per cent to 42 per cent. For any given reduction in the deficit, however, the economic benefits of reduced spending have proved to be much higher than the benefits of higher tax revenues. In other words, it matters a lot <I>how</I> we balance the budget.<br>
 -- Fortunately, there has been relatively little new regulatory legislation on Clinton's watch; indeed a substantial deregulation of agriculture and telecommunications was approved (though without much of an Administration role). But Clinton and congressional Democrats blocked other regulatory-reform measures. Of greater concern, Clinton seems to have given the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration almost free rein. For example, the FDA has proposed major restrictions on tobacco marketing with no clear statutory authority.
 -- In response to the trial lawyers, Clinton vetoed bills to restrict shareholder suits and to reform product-liability law. The costly litigation explosion is another factor in the deterioration in productivity.<br>
 -- Senior members of the Administration have demonized corporate CEOs, the banking industry, drug firms, the insurance industry, oil companies, the medical profession, and tobacco firms. Clinton has jeopardized foreign investment by threatening to extend U.S. law to the operations of parent companies abroad. Which firm, industry, or profession is next?<br>
 -- Clinton opposes proposals to reduce the tax bias against saving and investment while refusing to even acknowledge the multi-trillion dollar implicit debt of the Social Security system.</blockquote>
<p>

In sum, the damage done by President Clinton is not primarily that productivity growth has declined on his brief watch. It is that with few exceptions, he has actively opposed the measures that the United States must take to reverse this disturbing trend. Ironically, Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992 issuing a challenge to the American people to have ``the courage to change.'' Now he is the adversary of the very changes in policies that are imperative to build a prosperous future for our children. On this record, Clinton has no claim to the mantle of compassion.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>F</font> Woody Allen was right that 90 per cent of life is just showing up, then Bill Clinton has a stellar fiscal record. The federal budget deficit has tumbled from $255 billion in 1993 to a projected $117 billion this year. And Clinton was there when it happened. But that just about covers the extent of his involvement. For evidence of this, let's review the Clinton record over the past three and a half years:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton announces his new Administration's first economic program: a $16-billion ``fiscal stimulus.'' The spending package is later abandoned by the Democratic Congress as too fiscally irresponsible.
<P>
 -- In February 1993 President Clinton wins passage of his $250-billion tax hike -- which New York Sen. Pat Moynihan accurately describes as ``the largest tax increase in world history.'' It passes both houses of Congress without a single Republican vote. The package contains approximately $2 of new spending for every $1 of new taxes.
<P>
 -- In September 1993 the Clinton White House lobbies to defeat the bi-partisan Penny - Kasich deficit-reduction bill, which would have cut federal spending and the deficit by $90 billion over five years.
<P>
 -- In January 1994 Bill and Hillary Clinton unveil ``ClintonCare.'' The proposed hostile federal takeover of one-seventh of the U.S. economy would add at least $75 billion to the deficit over the next six years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
<P>
 -- In September 1994 the President furiously lobbies liberal Democrats in Congress to oppose a Balanced Budget Amendment -- a measure supported by 75 per cent of the American public. Labor Secretary Robert Reich is a little too honest when he confirms most Americans' suspicions about this Administration: ``The President is against simply balancing the budget.''
<P>
 -- In October 1994 the President signs into law his $30-billion ``crime bill.'' The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> describes the legislation as a ``once-in-a-lifetime  federal spending bonanza'' containing ``a vast array of new social programs'' including federally funded exotic-dance classes, sensitivity-training courses, and midnight-basketball leagues. The cost of the Clinton bill has to be shaved after the Democratic House of Representatives rejects the original version as too expensive.
<P>
 -- In January 1995 Bill Clinton submits a 1996 budget plan that calls for $12 trillion of spending over the next seven years and $200-billion deficits for as far as the eye can see. Even <I>Washington Post</I> reporter David Broder blasts the document as a ``symbol of Clinton's failed leadership.'' Because of the debt Clinton is adding, writes Broder, ``the annual net interest is projected to climb from $198 billion in 1993 to $270 billion in 1997 -- when it will, for the first time, be larger than the projected defense budget.''
<P>
 -- In March 1995 Clinton again helps torpedo the Balanced Budget Amendment -- this time by strong-arming five Democratic senators, who had campaigned as champions of the amendment -- to flip-flop and vote no.
<P>
 -- In June 1995, under pressure from the GOP Congress, Bill Clinton submits a new, revised budget proposal. It still doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In July 1995 the Clinton White House begins its successful ``Medi-scare'' strategy to undermine public support for a GOP plan to rein in stampeding Medicare costs. Even the <I>Washington Post</I> editorializes that the Clinton Administration has become a gang of ``medagogues.'' On Medicare and Medicaid, the White House is ``engaged in an irresponsible campaign based on distortion and fear.''
<P>
 -- In October 1995 Bill Clinton confirms what most of the public is already painfully aware of: ``I raised your taxes too much.''
<P>
 -- In December 1995 Bill Clinton vetoes the historic balanced-budget legislation enacted by the Republican Congress -- listing 82 reasons why it cuts too much spending. He complains of cuts in everything from foreign aid to corporate welfare.
<P>
 -- Later that month Bill Clinton releases his unprecedented third and then fourth budget proposals of the year. But they <I>still</I> don't balance the budget.
<P>
 -- In February 1996 Bill Clinton releases a $1.65-trillion 1997 budget that calls for $360 billion in added spending, or $3,100 per American household, over the next seven years. Then with a straight face he tells the nation that ``the era of big government is over.'' Oh, and the proposal <I>still</I> doesn't balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
 -- In April 1996 Clinton signs the GOP budget after the Republicans capitulate to his demands and add back some $10 billion of deficit spending.
</blockquote>
<P>
<font size=+3>W</font><font size=+1>HEW!</font> This really is a pillar of fiscal integrity we have in the White House. The point of this demoralizing three-and-a-half-year budget odyssey is this: The Clinton Administration cannot credibly claim credit for the reduction in the deficit unless the nation is suffering from a severe case of fiscal amnesia.
<P>
On at least three separate occasions in 1993 and 1994 -- the fiscal-stimulus package, ClintonCare, and the crime bill -- the Administration attempted to make the deficit situation worse, but amazingly was constrained by a Democratic Congress. On four other instances, bipartisan deficit-reduction initiatives were rebuked by Clinton. 
<P>
Since the Republicans took control of Congress in November of 1994, Clinton's fiscal obstructionism and demagoguery has been elevated to Olympic levels. The Republicans' budget-balancing plan was thrashed almost daily by the White House as ``mean-spirited,'' ``radical,'' ``harmful to children, the poor, and the environment,'' and ``just plain wrong for America.'' Yet in typical Clinton fashion, one day the budget is denounced as ``wrong for America,'' the next day the White House is staging a Rose Garden press conference claiming credit for the impressive first-year deficit reduction that the ``mean-spirited'' Republican budget produced.
<P>
So how much of the credit for the impressive drop in the deficit this year does the Administration deserve? The standard spin from the White House these days is that the ``enormous progress'' on the deficit vindicates the Clinton ``$500-billion deficit-reduction'' package of 1993. It turns out we can roughly calculate how much of the deficit decline is attributable to Clinton, and how much to Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress. Back in April 1995, just before the Republicans released their seven-year balanced-budget plan, the CBO announced that Clinton's deficit-reduction plan would produce $211 billion of red ink in 1996.
<P>
Instead, the deficit will fall to $117 billion. That's a $94-billion improvement -- almost entirely attributable to the GOP budget. Over the entire seven-year budget window, the Gingrich plan chops a shade over $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) of deficit spending from the Clintonomics baseline.
<P>
The budget deficit would be lower still had it not been for Bill Clinton's vetoes of Republican Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and appropriations bills. Those vetoes canceled an estimated $10 to $15 billion in budget cuts for 1996 -- savings that would have been magnified in future years.
<P>
GOP partisans can hardly exult in the deficit story of the past five years, however. Despite this Administration's sorry record of fiscal obstructionism, there is still the unarguable underlying fact that Bill Clinton's overall fiscal performance has been far superior to that of his predecessor, George Bush.
<P>
All the deficit reduction of the last three years is simply recovering the lost ground of the early 1990s -- Richard Darman's reign of fiscal terror. It is a popular myth that George Bush inherited a budget crisis ``baked in the cake'' from Ronald Reagan. When Reagan left the White House in January 1989, the deficit was $150 billion and forecast to decline gradually till it reached $110 billion in 1995. The CBO concluded that continued deficit reduction would occur if Bush (and Darman) simply left fiscal policy on automatic pilot.
<P>
Instead, we got Bush's infamous reversal on ``no new taxes'' and a 1990 budget package that dealt a body blow to an already ailing economy and sent the deficit into the stratosphere. From 1990 to 1995 the national debt soared $622 billion above the levels anticipated in 1989. Richard Darman's enduring legacy to the nation is this: 1990 - 94 was the worst five-year deficit performance since World War II. Now really, how hard has it been for Clinton to improve on that rotten fiscal record?
<P>
The Left is now again busy trying to rewrite history to suggest that the Bush 1990 and the Clinton 1993 tax hikes contributed mightily to the decline in the deficit. The top marginal income-tax rate has risen by 50 per cent -- from 28 per cent in 1989 to 42 per cent this year. Yet federal revenues grew faster in the 1980s with Reagan's substantial across-the-board tax cut than during the 1990s with these two giant tax hikes.
<P>
Overall real federal revenues (1982 to 1989) grew by 24 per cent during the seven-year period after the Reagan tax cuts took full effect. But (as currently forecast by the Congressional Budget Office) overall federal revenue growth from 1990 through 1997 will be only 18.5 per cent. If federal revenues had grown in the 1990s at only the pace they did after the Reagan tax cuts, federal receipts in 1996 would be almost $50 billion greater and the deficit would be one-third smaller.
<P>
Income-tax receipts after adjusting for inflation rose by 16.3 per cent in the seven years after the full Reagan tax cut. Income-tax receipts will have climbed by 16.1 per cent in real terms in the seven years since 1990.
<P>
So where is the evidence that these tax increases actually raised revenues?
<P>
If tax hikes don't account for the lowering of the deficit, what does? America's victory in the Cold War. (The extent of Bill Clinton's contribution to that effort was in obtaining draft deferments.) In the 1980s the nation invested $2 trillion on the Reagan military build-up to vanquish the Evil Empire -- perhaps the only truly successful government program of the last half-century. Now we are rapidly demilitarizing, creating a vast budget windfall. Over the past eight years the Pentagon's budget has fallen by almost $110 billion in real terms. How's this for a coincidence: that's almost precisely how much the real budget deficit has fallen over that period.
<P>
Normally in post-war years the United States Government not only moves immediately back to a balanced-budget regime, but cuts taxes and then runs budget <I>surpluses</I> to begin paying off the wartime debt. In the post - Cold War 1990s none of those things have happened. No tax cut. No balanced budget. No liquidation of the debt. Instead defense cutbacks have helped camouflage a sustained non-defense spending build-up. Between 1989 and 1995, real defense outlays have fallen by one-third, while everything else we spend money on -- from peanut subsidies to the Mark Hatfield Memorial Courthouse in Portland -- has climbed by $300 billion, or 30 per cent. Last year federal spending on non-defense programs consumed 18 per cent of national output, a larger share than at any previous time in American history. The nanny state is alive and well in America.
<P>
So much so that we can now add the most recent and depressing entry to the Clinton fiscal chronology:
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- In July 1996 the CBO announces that the Clinton deficit-reduction honeymoon is over. After 1997, the Clinton baseline outlook steadily deteriorates in every year for the next decade. Then the government's finances implode. Runaway entitlement expenditures -- particularly for Medicare and Medicaid -- ravage the budget. The CBO predicts that unless transfer payments are curtailed the nation faces a future of ``unsustainably high levels of federal borrowing,'' with the national debt ascending relentlessly from 60 per cent of national output today, to 150 per cent by 2025.</blockquote>
<P>
Thank you, Bill Clinton.

<FONT SIZE=+3>B</FONT><font size=+1>ILL</font> Clinton's 1993 tax package included the biggest hike in income-tax rates since Herbert Hoover's misguided tax increase in 1930. Supporters of the tax hike argued that the higher taxes on the rich would bring in much-needed revenues to reduce the budget deficit, and would also help close the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor.
<P>
Yet the most remarkable feature of the Clinton tax hike has been its failure to generate additional revenues. Even liberals, after all, presumably do not favor higher tax rates just for the sake of punishing success. Do they? Yet consider the following: Taxes consumed 19.2 per cent of economic output (GDP) the year Reagan left office. Since that time, there have been two major tax increases, the Bush tax hike of 1990 and Clinton's record increase of 1993. The impact on tax collections? The Congressional Budget Office estimates revenues this year will total 19.1 per cent of GDP, down by one-tenth of a point.
<P>
The futility of higher tax rates can be seen by examining income-tax revenues as a percent of GDP. Higher income-tax rates were to be the major revenue raisers in both the Bush and the Clinton tax hikes, yet income-tax revenues have fallen from 8.6 per cent of GDP when Reagan left office to 8.5 per cent this year, according to the CBO. These numbers are particularly compelling since income-tax revenues typically rise over time as a percentage of GDP in countries with ``progressive'' tax systems, as even modest increases in income gradually push people into higher tax brackets. The Clinton Administration no doubt would point out that revenues fell under Bush and have risen in the last four years, but this pick-up in revenues is mainly a function of the business cycle and does not change the underlying fact that government is collecting less as a percentage of output even though (or rather, because) the top income-tax rate is 50 per cent higher today than it was at the end of the Reagan era.
<P>
The failure of income-tax-rate increases can also be confirmed by examining the growth of income-tax revenue in constant dollars. During the Reagan years, when tax rates were reduced twice, inflation-adjusted income-tax revenues rose an average of 2.2 per cent each year. In the post -  Reagan era, which has seen two massive tax-rate increases, revenue growth has slowed to 1.3 per cent annually. Once again, the White House would argue that this comparison does not distinguish between Bush and Clinton, but, since the two Presidents had virtually identical policies of raising tax rates on the rich, such a distinction would be meaningless.
<P>
Income-tax revenues also grew substantially faster in the 1960s after President Kennedy's 30 per cent across-the-board tax cuts than in the 1950s with tax rates as high as 90 per cent. In the 1950s real income-tax receipts were flat. Following the Kennedy tax cuts, the revenues increased at a 4.8 per cent clip. After LBJ's surtax, revenue growth again fell by more than half. There seems to be a pattern emerging here.
<P>
So if the Bush and Clinton tax increases failed to raise revenues, why has government borrowing declined by more than $100 billion since Clinton took office? Two reasons. First, large real cutbacks in the defense budget of nearly 6 per cent annually; and second, a slow down in the growth of inflation-adjusted domestic spending from the enormous 6.3 per cent annual average under George Bush to 2.5 per cent under Clinton. Yes, it's a sad but true fiscal fact that federal spending has been far more restrained during the Clinton Administration than it was during the Bush Administration. But both Presidents' attempts to gain revenues by raising tax rates have been utterly futile.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HERE</font>  was the nation's First Stepmother when, according to the best liberal opinion, the future of America's children was being destroyed by the passage of welfare reform? The welfare-rights coalition and Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman were frantically lobbying the White House for a presidential veto. In their effort to influence the President, NOW members even launched a hunger strike (and they might just have caught his eye if they had slimmed down). But while this pitched battle was going on, Hillary Clinton -- missing in action. 
<P>
Yet the First Lady, whose public life has been ostentatiously dedicated to the well-being of children, has curiously escaped being held to account by her liberal allies. She may have persuaded them that she was pleading their case behind closed doors, but it's more likely that Edelman and Co. recognize what one liberal advocate in Arkansas reluctantly concluded long ago: ``We learned not to expect anything of Hillary. What was the one thing she would go to the wall for? Bill's Presidency.'' 
<P>
Yet with the Administration deeply divided over whether or not to sign the welfare bill, there's little doubt that Hillary's influence would have been decisive. Richard Reeves enjoyed lunch at the White House with the Clintons recently and reported that the President glanced guiltily at Hillary to seek permission before ordering a piece of blueberry pie. If Hillary controls Bill's pastry consumption, she certainly could have prevented him from swallowing the distasteful gruel of welfare reform. But although Hillary has been committed to spending other people's money on behalf of liberal causes, she has been unwilling to spend Bill's political capital to advance the agenda. In the Clinton household, politics counts for more than principles and even friendship (just ask Lani Guinier).
<P>
Confronted with the First Lady's unprecedented unpopularity -- the latest polls show her favorability rating below sea level (30 per cent) -- one defender argues that Hillary makes us uncomfortable because she is so good. Ruth Rosen, professor of history at the University of California at Davis, explains that Hillary is ``the perfect scapegoat because she has a moral compass and is not afraid to follow it.''
<P>
In fact, Hillary's compass always pointed straight to the White House. Betsy Wright, Clinton's chief of staff when he was governor, speculates that the Clintons thought that Bill could win the Presidency from the time they married. Bill had the vision, Hillary provided the focus and discipline. When his mother had trouble accepting a daughter-in-law whom she regarded as a prickly, unattractive feminist, he reportedly explained: ``Look, Ma, I have work to do. I don't need to be married to a sex goddess.'' 
<P>
A politically successful partnership with a division of responsibility was formed from Clinton's early days as governor. Bill bobbed about in the centrist waters of Arkansas and joined the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in the mid Eighties. It fell to Hillary, with her collegiate history of liberal activism, to nail down the Democratic base. Hillary accordingly served on the national boards of the Legal Services Corporation, the Children's Defense Fund, and the leftist New World Foundation.
<P>
But her espousal of liberal causes was strictly for export. Back home she had shed her maiden name, thick glasses, 15 pounds, and opposition to capital punishment. In particular, her advocacy on behalf of neglected children was a wholesale, out-of-state operation. While she toiled on the national scene urging Congress to live up to its moral responsibilities, the child-welfare system in Arkansas became a national disgrace. Its comparative infant mortality rate increased during her husband's 12-year tenure. But national reputations are not made by small local improvements.
<P>
Following Bill Clinton's jarring defeat for re-election in 1980, Hillary was better able to protect her investment in him than in Whitewater. Having already reformed her feminist appearance, she went to work on her irritating tendency to aloofness and superiority. An aide to Governor Clinton explained, ``This is a very personal state. Now, for Clinton that empathy is natural. But Hillary learned how to project it.''
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size==1>UT</font> not convincingly. Her sense of superiority is still apparent. People aren't having trouble -- as Ann Lewis endlessly insists they are -- reconciling themselves to a new kind of First Lady who is independent, accomplished, and outspoken. The dislike of the First Lady has nothing to do with people's inability to adjust to ``the changing nature of women's roles'' or with any discomfort we mortals might feel when confronted by the noble and virtuous. People dislike the First Lady because they reasonably resent someone who believes herself to be morally superior to them even as she pursues power and status like the most cynical of politicians.
<P>
In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be influential and prominent without the scrutiny and accountability that politicians must endure. She wants to be viewed as having a successful, independent career while having traded on her influence and access as the governor's wife. Her formidable skills of advocacy are used to attack Bill's opponents, who can't fight back against his wife as they would against the President himself. Above all, she wants the rewards associated with success in the private sector while pursuing political advancement in the foundation world and public sector.
<P>
Hillary insists that pro-bono legal work is ``the heart and soul of the law,'' but her own work in the cause of legal aid or children's rights was either compensated or politically useful. The righteous Wellesley graduate who told her fellow students that the ``acquisitive, and competitive corporate life . . . is not the way of life for us'' earned $129,000 in directors' fees from Arkansas corporations. 
<P>
She notes in addition the burden she has carried to support the family. When questioned about apparent influence peddling, conflicts of interest, or cattle futures, she impatiently cites the enormous financial sacrifices the Clintons have made to permit Bill's public service. But while the Clintons were making these sacrifices for the common good in Arkansas, the state's taxpayers footed the bill for food, shelter, servants, and entertainment; the Arkansas state auditor estimated their upkeep cost at $750,000 annually.
<P>
Hillary bitterly resents being questioned about such matters. She has always hated the media and now believes the press is becoming ``the handmaiden of the Right,'' no less. But the press rises above it, and women journalists in particular would rather burnish the feminist icon than examine its calves of clay. We're told about the unswerving ``sense of mission'' that has kept Hillary too busy to respond cogently to accusations of improprieties. It's Hillary's ``do-good energy'' that makes her ``fierce and protective.'' 
<P>
These warm maternal qualities are not always evident to those who know her well. An admiring friend whose divorce Hillary handled confessed that she was fearful of her own attorney. ``I would never cross her,'' she declares. Hillary encouraged the media to investigate some alleged infidelities of George Bush during the 1992 campaign -- that ``sense of mission,'' no doubt. And her temper in general has been well documented. When she advised in her recent book that, in order to stay married, sometimes ``you have to bite your tongue,'' one can't help wondering if that's in order to improve her aim.
<P>
Fortunately, Hillary's brusque self-confidence trumped her pragmatism when it came to reforming the health-care system. This was one reform that wasn't about Bill; it was her baby, to be loved, cherished, and delivered on time. She was fighting not for ClintonCare but for Rodham Rx. Convinced that her efforts had produced a near-perfect product, she would brook no criticism and make no compromise. If Hillary Clinton had a dash of modesty, our health care would probably have been socialized. But she allowed the worst to be the enemy of the bad.
<P>
Despite her withdrawal into purdah, Hillary remains the motive force behind ideological liberalism in the White House and the Administration generally. She had a hand in the major liberal appointments, like that of Donna Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services. She has salted the agencies with her followers. And she is a presence who inspires awe and even fear in senior aides.
<P>
Her legal writings, her Arkansas practice, and her record in the world of legal activism all show her to be a devout believer in the power of government to transform human lives for the better. Her sense of mission, which this belief inspires, allows her to bend the rules -- whether in Whitewater or in organizing the White House Health Care Task Force -- with a clear conscience. She is one of nature's Commissars. Among New Democrats, that makes her a Lenin in a den of Daniels. But it is her ill fortune to come within a heartbeat of power in a conservative age of diminished expectations for centralized power and what government can achieve.
<P>
At first she resisted this truth and tried to push through a total restructuring of health care by the sheer power of presidential authority and her own self-confidence. But she was defeated. And just as after the 1980 Arkansas gubernatorial election, she learned from her defeat. Her prudent silence in the face of welfare reform is one evidence of a lesson learned. Another, as Ramesh Ponnuru  points out, is her return to reforming health care by a Fabian policy of gradualism. If Hillary has her way, health care will be socialized little by little, and we won't notice until the trap is sprung.

<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> June 22, 1994, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, to no fanfare whatsoever, issued Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 (IB 94-1). The bulletin applied to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a 1974 law designed to protect pension funds from reckless managers. Section 404 of the law makes creating benefits for pension beneficiaries the ``exclusive purpose'' of pension investing. This is the part of ERISA that Reich's bulletin re-interpreted, saying pension-fund managers could consider both the interests of beneficiaries and secondary benefits to other parties when investing pension funds. A hard-to-follow exercise in bureaucratic minutiae? Well, yes. Insignificant? No. Interpretative Bulletin 94-1 was an opening shot in a Clinton Administration policy offensive potentially as radical in scope as its health-care plan, an attempt to tap into a portion of the nation's $3.5 trillion in private pension-money funds to advance its social agenda.
<P>
The re-interpretation of ERISA, and the supporting efforts surrounding it, exemplify the way the Clinton Administration has tweaked regulations and interpretations of law to make policy advances; the way its mid-level personnel has agitated for an agenda at odds with the Administration's public, centrist pose; and the cozy relationship between the Clinton Executive Branch and the activist Left. The Executive Branch and the larger federal bureaucracy by themselves -- without grandiose legislative proposals or high-profile public advocacy -- provide endless opportunities for prosecuting an ideological agenda and protecting the cold political interests of a President. This most political Administration has taken every opportunity afforded it, prospering in Washington's legal and bureaucratic thickets.
<P>
The Clinton Administration re-interpreted ERISA so as to clear the way for so-called Economically Targeted Investments (ETIs). A long-time favorite of the Left, the thrust of ETIs is to steer private pension funds to public purposes (investments in public housing, infrastructure projects, jobs programs, etc.). For the Left, ETIs are a handy way to control middle-class dollars -- diverting retirement funds from more profitable uses -- without an actual tax increase. Clinton, who promoted ETIs in Arkansas, included in his 1992 policy manifesto ``Putting People First'' a proposal for $80 billion of federal investment in social projects to be leveraged with public and private pensions. Once he took office, his Administration began to push the ETI agenda, beneath headlines and the notice of much of the public.
<P>
Assistant Labor Secretary Olena Berg banged the drums across the country for ETIs. A former board member of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which had already gone in big for social investments, she boasted that ``This is the beginning of a turning point.'' In February of 1994 she urged big investors, according to <I>Business Week</I>, ``to invest the dollars now held by pension funds in ways that create more jobs.'' HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, meanwhile, was setting up what he called a ``precedent-setting initiative to attract pension-fund investments to housing for low-income people''; six pension funds agreed to invest in affordable housing projects with $100 million in federal backing. After the Administration issued IB94-1 in June of 1994, it also set up a federal ``clearinghouse'' to showcase successful social investments. 
<P>
The pedigree of ETIs -- Miss Berg herself calls them ``a radical notion'' -- has been documented by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which has worked aggressively to expose the Clinton offensive on pensions. A moving force behind the idea is the Center for Policy Alternatives (CPA), a socialistic spin-off of the radical Institute for Policy Studies. CPA has flacked tirelessly for ETIs at least since 1990. In the Clinton Administration, it finally had a sympathetic ear. A CPA conference on the idea in 1995 drew some half-dozen Administration participants. CPA's ``public capital program'' manager tells of working closely with Administration officials on ETIs. Indeed, the idea of a clearinghouse had been proposed by CPA, and the Administration initially even selected the organization as the contractor for the project.
<P>
All this has effectively been shut down by Rep. Jim Saxton (R., N.J.), vice chairman of the JEC, who sponsored a bill that passed by a wide margin, repealing Reich's IB 94-1 and abolishing the clearinghouse. The pension issue is a natural for the GOP, and Democrats sense it. But the feckless Sen. Nancy Kassebaum has sat on a companion bill in the Senate. Which is par for the course: the Administration pushing to the limits on behalf of its agenda, while Republicans pull up short on the counterattack. ``They're chillingly pragmatic about all this, realizing that they can't advance the liberal parts of their agenda publicly so they find imaginative ways to try to do it anyway,'' says one House aide. There have been a number of underground ways the Administration has continued a liberal march without much attention, manipulating the bureaucracy and advancing its agenda by stealth. If declaring the end of ``the era of big government'' is the Clinton Administration by day, this is it by night.
<P>
Take RU-486. Abortion is one of the issues on which Clinton can't leave the Left -- despite the ``rare'' rhetoric -- so he was eager to deliver on the ``abortion pill.'' In January of 1993 Clinton wrote HHS Secretary Donna Shalala -- FDA Commissioner David Kessler's boss -- a memo asking HHS to promote the ``testing, licensing, and manufacturing'' of the drug. Kessler had pre-emptively reacted to the pressure five weeks after the 1992 elections, unilaterally reversing Bush Administration policy. He wrote to RU-486's manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, prodding it to apply for approval in the U.S. (``further clinical trials may not be required,'' he added helpfully). Everybody all around got the hints -- Kessler doing Clinton's bidding to save his job, Roussel Uclaf doing Kessler's bidding to avoid future run-ins. RU-486 is slated for FDA approval as early as September, and the Clinton Administration will have provided America with the drug as surely as if it had sponsored legislation to do so. 
<P>
<font size=+3>F</font><font size=+1>EDERAL</font> departments, meanwhile, have become touchstones for the organized Left and agents for advancing a PC agenda otherwise seen only on college campuses. The EPA, for instance, is a breeding ground for self-perpetuating activism. Since 1993, according to a GAO report, grants awarded for workshops, conferences, and non-scientific studies -- mostly the province of environmental advocacy groups -- have nearly doubled, from roughly $130 million to about $250 million. The American Association of Retired Persons has received some $40 million in 23 different grants since 1993; the Environmental Defense Fund has grabbed $1.8 million. Meanwhile, despite an amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) stipulating that it wouldn't apply to domestic partners, the EPA includes domestic partners in its own leave plan. EPA chief Carol Browner proudly cited the policy in an e-mail celebrating June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month -- ``In Headquarters, and in some Regional Offices, activities are being organized by the Chapters of the Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Employees (GLOBE) of EPA. Please join them . . .''
<P>
More broadly, the Administration has made full use of the propaganda power of the executive branch (see Christina Hoff Sommers, next page). The Civil Service subcommittee of the House Reform and Oversight Committee under Rep. John Mica (R., Fla.) has documented an Administration effort to ``roll out'' a weekly message through the public-affairs offices of federal departments, including those in field offices nationwide. (Veterans Affairs, Labor, and the EPA seem to be heavily involved.) ``It's putting hundreds of government employees at work flacking for you all over the country,'' says a House aide. House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Clinger (R., Penn.) conducted a May hearing on the Administration's wide-ranging politicization of the federal bureaucracy: 
<P>
<blockquote>
 -- VA Secretary Jesse Brown included a long ``message'' on employees' check stubs. ``As I have been telling the nation's veterans organizations this summer,'' Brown wrote, ``the Administration's [budget] plan is much better for veterans and their families.''
<P>
 -- In February 1995 an internal EPA e-mail discussed how ``Enviros are looking for some help in the conference committee on unfunded mandates,'' and suggested what the agency could do to support their lobbying. 
<P>
 -- A state director of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management wrote a letter last year advising public-land constituents of the department's opposition to a GOP grazing bill and inviting them ``to come together to work for the health of the public lands and the long-term economic stability of the West.'' Cabinet Secretaries can certainly take positions on public issues, but their departments aren't supposed to be arms of a permanent political campaign.</blockquote> 
<P>
Unions have been an integral part of this campaign too. Federal public-employee unions were kept apprised of crucial early strategy meetings organized by the Treasury Department to prepare for the looming budget crisis in 1995 (the meetings, again, were uncovered by Saxton's Joint Economic Committee). Ordinarily, public-employee unions would be concerned about a government shutdown and Treasury's planned raid on their pension trust funds during it. Instead, the unions eagerly participated in the Administration's shut-down strategy. ``We will be '<B>ON THEIR CASE AND IN THEIR FACE</B>,''' the American Federation of Government Employees president wrote of GOP freshmen in an August 1995 letter to members, well in advance of any shutdown. ``The question is not whether we work, but in what kind of America we will work.'' The Administration has paid back the unions for their loyalty. The Office of Personnel Management provided names and home addresses of its employees -- a clear breach of their privacy -- to the unions representing them. Mica's subcommittee discovered an OMB letter confirming that other federal agencies would be doing the same. 
<P>
There is a certain virtuosity to all this. The Democrats simply are more comfortable with power than the Republicans. That's why the Clinton Administration can -- after some initial stumbles -- push and pull all the political levers like an expert lathe operator. Two other factors are at work as well. One is necessity. The political imperative in the current environment is to move, as Ralph Reed once famously said of the Christian Coalition, ``quietly, with stealth, under cover of night.'' The other is lack of scruple. The Administration reflects the Clintons' ruthlessness in pursuit of power. The theme of former Republican officials brought to Capitol Hill to testify on Clinton Administration practices is always: We never would have done that, we couldn't have gotten away with it. Well, for whatever reason, the Clinton Administration can. For Republicans, the reward for their virtue is in heaven. The reward for the Clintonites' shamelessness may well be in a second term.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OUNDED</font> in 1989, Ervin and Associates, a contracting firm based in Bethesda, Md., and specializing in affordable housing, more than tripled in size in its first five years. In July, 1994 its work was commended by Assistant Secretary for Housing Nicholas Retsinas in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Employment, Housing, and Aviation. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the company raised over $165,000 to help the families of HUD employees who lost their lives. On John Ervin's office wall hangs a framed picture of his staff with HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros to mark the occasion, and a letter from the Secretary notes, ``The HUD family will always be grateful for your kindness.''
<P>
Well, maybe not ``always.'' Ervin has filed a suit against the department claiming its rampant politicization is running him out of business. Specifically, Ervin charges that the head of HUD's housing division, Helen Dunlap, has steered lucrative federal contract awards -- known by industry types as ``honey pots'' -- to her ``contractors of choice,'' in keeping with her animus against white males. Since Miss Dunlap's political appointment in 1994, Mr. Ervin's federal contacts have been cut almost in half, and the firm has had to downsize its full-time staff from 47 to 23. Moreover, Ervin claims, HUD's employment practice reflects an institutional bias. HUD counters that Ervin is a ``disgruntled contractor'' and that safeguards prevent contract patronage. His suit is pending in D.C.'s district court, but briefs filed by Ervin and documents he has obtained from HUD highlight disturbing practices -- blatant hiring quotas, outright hostility to white males, and possibly favoritism in contracts -- that go unnoticed in the thicket of the federal bureaucracy. 
<P>
Mr. Ervin asserts he has been recommended for many contracts by so-called source evaluation boards -- panels of career civil servants that are meant to combat patronage -- only to see Helen Dunlap ``orchestrate'' efforts to ``bypass the normal procurement processes which are intended to prevent the very abuses'' Ervin is being subjected to. In one case, Ervin alleges Miss Dunlap awarded a $30-million asset-management contract to the purportedly ``disadvantaged'' firm Williams and Adley, breaching a prior contract which Ervin says HUD previously informed him was legally his. Following objections raised by Ervin and career housing-division employees, according to <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I>, the HUD inspector general launched an investigation into contract malfeasance by the housing division. Miss Dunlap was demoted from her political appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing to Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing Operations.
<P>
Despite this, Helen Dunlap reportedly waged a power struggle with her replacement (a white male), holding duplicate staff meetings immediately after his and asserting that she was still in charge and didn't intend to surrender. And she apparently won; she inexplicably regained her jurisdiction over contract awards and, Mr. Ervin claims, vindictively blackballs his firm from obtaining such awards. ``They throw the fox out of the hen house and then let it back in,'' says Ervin.
<P>
This attitude carries over into the way Miss Dunlap manages her division. <I>Housing Affairs Letter</I> quotes one high-level HUD source who says Dunlap ``made many enemies after joining the department.'' According to anonymous moles in HUD, she refers to the men in her front office as ``TOMs,'' or ``Tired Old Males,'' and has said that ``the only fitting position for a male is a secretary.'' It is not without reason that some of these career employees have been known to call their office a ``white boys' hell.''
<P>
But discrimination is not confined to Helen Dunlap and HUD contracts. Department managers are ranked on how well they achieve cultural diversity within their divisions. They are given evaluations with ratings of Outstanding, Fully Successful, and Unacceptable; an ``outstanding'' manager ``takes actions and makes decisions regarding hiring, promotions, training, upward mobility, recommendations for selection, and other personnel or administrative matters that further the Department's . . . Affirmative Employment Program policies and foster diversity within the HUD workplace.'' In short, color over merit.
<P>
Internal hiring data obtained by John Ervin under the Freedom of Information Act indicate what close attention is paid to ``diversity.'' A chart produced by HUD breaks down each department division by race and gender, noting changes over a six-month cycle. From September 1995 to March 1996, for example, Miss Dunlap's Office of Housing severely cut white men from the better professional and administrative positions (professionals down 10 per cent compared to 1 per cent department-wide).
<P>
In a previous analysis by HUD for 1996, the department reported a ``manifest imbalance'' (representation ``substantially below'' the civilian labor force) within its housing division in professional Hispanic females, and administrative and technical white females. An accompanying chart entitled ``Internal Movement Numerical Objectives'' called for 90 ``planned'' division hirings -- 20 white females, 20 black females, 20 black males, 10 Hispanic males, 10 Hispanic females, 5 Asian males, and 5 Asian females. Figures for white males were nil.
<P>
What is most striking, however, is not that HUD uses quotas in its hiring and promotions, but that the basis for these quotas in divisions across the country appears to be the Civilian Labor Force statistics for Washington, D.C. That is, a district field office in, say, Kansas City must strive to reflect the demographic composition of D.C. workers (the city's population is over 70 per cent minority). Kansas City's HUD field office has a total of five employees at the professional level: three white males, two black males. In a HUD document titled ``Assessment of Underrepresentation,'' the department categorizes all employees by race and gender and suggests in a ``number needed'' column that Kansas City should hire two white women, two black women, and a male and female each of Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian derivation.
<P>
Interestingly, in every assessment of white-male underrepresentation spanning HUD's 10 regions and 79 field offices, there is no ``number needed'' advisement for more white males.
<P>
While Nelson Diaz, head of HUD's office of General Counsel, mandates an obligatory three-and-a-half hour ``sensitivity training'' seminar for his employees, he apparently could use a little of this himself. According to attendees at a September 22, 1993, meeting of field counsel, Mr. Diaz declared that there are ``too many white faces at HUD.'' Subsequently, attempts were made to remove John Dellera (who is white) as Assistant General Counsel for New York/New Jersey. ``I doubted that the reassignment was bona fide and suspected it was an unlawful attempt to coerce my resignation so that Nelson could appoint some political friend to the job,'' Dellera wrote friends. Diaz replaced Dellera with a female Hispanic -- the office was deficient in the Hispanic female professional category, according to HUD reports. 
<P>
If the department isn't violating the letter of the law after the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision -- which held that race preferences will receive ``the strictest judicial scrutiny'' and will ``seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment'' -- it certainly violates the spirit. Not that it seems to matter. A May 16, 1996 HUD report dismisses the decision: ``<I>Adarand</I> did not provide clear judicial precedent on the constitutionality of specific affirmative action/ set-aside programs.'' Until the Supreme Court more clearly defines its guidelines, John Ervin just hopes to stay in the black -- despite being a white male trying to do business with Helen Dunlap's HUD.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N THE</font> novel <I>Primary Colors</I>, a senior Democratic senator is having an interview with the Bill Clinton figure, called Jack Stanton. It is well along in 1992, after the revelations about Gennifer Flowers and the record of evading the draft. The senior statesman does not know quite what to make of this precocious candidate, who carries about him the pronounced scent of things disreputable. Stanton is good with ``the folks'' -- he thrives on the engagement with ordinary people in a campaign. And he makes a ``nice speech.'' But then the senator turns and says, ``I have never seen a politician carry so much trouble around with him. You're like that cartoon character . . . Pigpen. A permanent cloud of dirt follows him around.''
<P>
Or as the Greeks would have it, character is destiny. Bill Clinton's permanent cloud was no accident; it sprang from something in his character. And when that something was conveyed into the work of a new Administration, it produced the surprises that should have been, by then, no surprise: an Administration that took, as the defining measures of its first moments, positions its leaders had never acknowledged in public or sought to justify in the course of the campaign. A candidate who had offered himself as a New Democrat, more sensitive on social issues, took as his first dramatic initiative an advanced position on gay rights, including gays in the military. A candidate who had lamented abortions, with a vow to make them ``rare'' as well as legal, moved on his first day in office -- in fact, moved even before he was sworn in -- to sign executive orders that would sweep away every inhibition on abortion in the federal service. The subsequent stories of Whitewater and Travelgate, of billing records curiously lost and rediscovered, of thuggish aides commandeering files from the FBI -- all of it plays out the script of characters straining their meager wit at the project of concealment rather than the task of governing. Indeed, it might be said that the project of concealment was what knitted this team together as its binding purpose. The first thing that must be understood then about Bill Clinton and the bully pulpit is that his Administration was constituted on premises that could not be expressed in public; and the principal genius of his staff was expended in covering up the incidents in his past that would imperil his moral claim to govern.
<P>
In June of 1993, I was at dinner with a seasoned Republican congressman, a man much liked on both sides of the aisle, and he remarked that, after the first, rocky months of Clinton's Presidency, his constituents had seen through him. Or they saw him clearly as he was. And what, I asked, did they see? ``That he is a man who will lie to them,'' he said, ``as readily as he will look at them.'' Three years later, when a jury in Little Rock handed down the first convictions of people close to the Clintons, a young reporter could remark on television that this event, though jolting, would have no measurable effect on the public standing of the President. For the public, he said, had long ago ``discounted'' Mr. Clinton's veracity. That is to say, a large portion of the public has absorbed now, with a serene acceptance, that Bill Clinton is an affable, incorrigible liar, but they have concluded that nothing in his vices threatens any public harm. In one recent survey, about 54 per cent of the public did not think that Bill Clinton could be considered ``honest and trustworthy.'' But the same surveys also reported that about 62 per cent think he has honesty and integrity enough to serve as President. There has evidently been a scaling down. The public has apparently absorbed those premises that were the hallmarks of ``modernity'': that there may be a separation between politics and morality, between private character and public office, and that a man overflowing with vices may nevertheless have considerable virtues as a public man.
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>T</font> became the standard refrain for a while among the Democrats that Clinton's personal life had nothing to do with his competence to deal with his public functions. But that argument quietly evaporated when Paula Jones filed her suit over sexual harassment. For since the outcry over Anita Hill in 1991, it had become a staple of the Left that sexual harassment deserved to be treated seriously, as a wrong claiming a high place in the public concern. With that sentiment kindling, there was a willingness to call forth the indignation of the public when the accusations broke over Sen. Bob Packwood. But when Paula Jones filed her own complaint, the Democrats were compelled to fall mute. They could no longer rail against Packwood and insist on the high significance of his offenses without sharpening the accusation against their own sitting President. It remained for Packwood to be removed from office by an Ethics Committee dominated by his own party. But the experience was quite enough to establish that Clinton's ``private'' conduct had a deeper public resonance after all. The need to defend Clinton induced his party to recede from an issue that it regarded as central, not peripheral, to the public business. His private troubles did indeed disarm or impair his party in addressing what it thought to be public matters of moral consequence.
<P>
Yet, as Madison said, if men were angels there would be no need for government. And a public steeped in Christianity has made its allowances for the sinful. (An echo sounds from a lyric of Stephen Sondheim: ``And as for being saintly, even faintly . . . no. But who needs Albert Schweitzer when the lights are low?/And oh, oh, oh, can that boy f -- oxtrot.'') At times it may indeed be true that the people needed urgently in a public mission are not virtuous in all things. That Churchill and Grant were heavy drinkers did not diminish the public need for them when their personal gifts marked them out for a mission that they, distinctly, could perform. If an inspired political man was able to summon the support of the public for a policy of putting abortion ``in the course of extinction,'' the pro-lifers would not be likely to desert him, if it turned out that his private life showed embarrassing lapses. And on the other side, we should not be shocked that the people who are determined to preserve unconstrained rights of abortion in America are quite as determined to cling to Bill Clinton even though his personal life could sustain, by itself, the tabloids at the supermarket.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>LL</font> of that we understand. And all of that we could readily grant: If we could accept Clinton's public purposes, we too might be able to share an urbane laugh over his character. But in his case there is a precise connection between his character and the political culture he represents: his personal libertinism reflects the core of what can be taken these days as liberal jurisprudence -- the notion of the ``autonomous self,'' unencumbered by moral restraints, which seeks, as its first freedom, sexual freedom, and as its primary legal support, the right to an abortion. In the ``culture war,'' the moral tradition is set against the ethic of that class that now controls the media, the universities, and the courts; and for all his faults, Bill Clinton is the exquisite reflection of that ethic and that class. In what other Administration could we find a highly placed officer, the deputy general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services, advancing the proposal for gay marriage, because it would ``expose and denaturalize the historical construction of gender at the heart of marriage''? A biped who makes these sounds can find its habitat only in a Democratic Administration. The Left on the campuses may wince when Clinton glides with the public wind and rejects gay marriage. But they are tolerant of his political weaving because they understand that he could never have been elected as a man of the modern American Left.
<P>
That difference, between the character of Clinton's policies and the character of his public rhetoric, is the measure of his considerable skill as a political man. He presides over an Administration of the post-McGovern Democrats, yet all that is happily overlooked by Middle America as he plays, with a flourish, on the chords of conventional morality. But how does he do it? How is he believable even for a moment when he strikes moral poses and presumes to engage in moral teaching?
<P>
``It should not fly, but behold! It does fly.'' He should have not the slightest standing to teach anything of moral consequence in public; and yet: he stands and he teaches. Indeed, the logic of his situation is that he cannot do otherwise without appearing defensive and giving the game away. One observer pointed out that Clinton was raised in a gambling town, where he learned early on the art of bluffing, or presenting the ``poker face.'' With his record, he is the last person to be preaching to young people about the virtues of chastity, and yet he preaches. As a man who evaded his obligations to serve in the military, it is clear that he cannot summon the least moral authority to send anyone else into combat. But of course, as Commander-in-Chief, he must be able to do just that. And his strength as a public man seems to reside precisely in his cheekiness, his unflagging willingness to brazen it out.
<P>
It is remarked, of course, that Franklin Roosevelt presided over a global war even though he himself had never served in the military. And among present-day Republicans, Dick Cheney and Phil Gramm did not serve, though they were of age during the war in Vietnam. Still, there is something different about a man who used every stratagem to avoid his obligation. There is a moral point here that deserves to be respected even by people who feel an affinity with Clinton over Vietnam: There is a kind of covenant society must have with the men who honored the claims of their own government, and accepted their obligation to serve in the military. They accepted those duties at a certain hazard to themselves, and many of them died. In the aftermath, we may have good reason to wish we had sent none of them into a war that did not command the conviction of the leaders who were directing it. But part of the covenant with the men who served -- to use language closer to the ground -- is that we don't make jerks of them. And that we emphatically do when we show a willingness to honor a man who prospered because he was not foolish enough to risk himself as they did. A public that elects Clinton is engaging in a gesture of contempt for the men who served, and veterans who voted for him are engaging in a gesture of self-contempt.
<P>
<font size=+3>B</font><font size=+1>UT</font> gamely putting all of that aside, what was Clinton to teach as he took hold of the bully pulpit? What was left? Could we imagine the scene as it must have been at Yale, over twenty years ago, as Bill Clinton, Robert Reich, and their friends would stay up in bull sessions, flexing their powers of conjecture, pondering the ways in which they might lead the country into bold paths of reform once the levers of power were put in their hands, as surely they would be? Could we imagine the moment of insight? ``We are going to come out against children smoking!'' Or: ``We are going to come out against dead-beat dads!'' Or: ``We are going to come out, forthrightly, unequivocally, against violence, and especially against the freedom to shoot people with assault weapons!''
<P>
That could hardly have been the vision that marked their dreams. But it may be the only recipe that is available to the generation that resolved long ago that there were no transcendent moral truths, particularly any truths grounded in ``nature.'' This group can rise to moral teaching mainly by sounding the themes of public pieties, with proposals so wanting in controversy that they would mesh even with the social policies of Joseph Goebbels and his party. They too had an ambitious scheme of allowances for children, and they were headed by a man who was an exemplary figure to the young in his shunning of tobacco. Still, even in this domain, the authority of Mr. Clinton must be equivocal. When he enjoins upon teenagers a life of chastity and abstinence, it clearly cannot be because he would respect that life in principle. In fact, it is hard to see why Mr. Clinton would not approach the problem of teenage smoking in the way that his Administration approaches teenage sexuality: After all, some youngsters will be determined to smoke anyway, as some youngsters will be determined to have sexual relations, and so we might as well provide them with cigarettes containing filter tips.
<P>
But of course even the health of children reaches its limit as a moral concern when it runs up against the interests of Mr. Clinton's core constituency. The President's solicitousness for children may be nearly maternal, but it evaporates dramatically when it comes to those children, with legs dangling out of the birth canal, who are the targets of ``partial-birth'' abortions. That children may become hooked on nicotine has become, for Mr. Clinton, a high public concern. That they may have their skulls crushed and their brains suctioned out, if it suits the interests or ``mental health'' of the women bearing them, is an injury that does not register. For in the presence of a trumping political interest, that infant simply does not register as a real being, capable of sustaining pain.
<P>
In the meantime, the editors of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> carefully unfold, over several years, the record of Whitewater, the Rose Law Firm, Webster Hubbell, Filegate. What is revealed is the pattern the editors characterize as ``Arkansas mores.'' The academic degrees may be from Yale, but the style of politics and moral fastidiousness is really Dogpatch U.S.A. But even the editors, worldly as they are, begin to show their puzzlement: The record unfolds and deepens, and yet it triggers no moral outrage in the public. That absence of reaction may itself be the news: namely, that we are dealing with a public shaped now by the changes of the Sixties and the public teaching of <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>. This may be a public coarsened now in its moral sensibility; and there may be nothing any longer in Clinton's repertoire that could stir this public to outrage.
<P>
We may well recall that old joke about the lawyer who is promised unbounded success in business and love, to be paid for in the end by the delivery of his soul. And he asks, guardedly, ``What's the catch?'' The accomplishment of Bill Clinton is that he has made the country into one large lawyer-joke. Clinton has marked off the record of an incorrigible liar, faithless to his wife, who cannot be trusted to honor any law beyond his own interest -- and the public says, ``Yes -- but what is the problem?''
<P>
And yet, it may be said on behalf of Mr. Clinton that he is one of the few men on the scene who is suited to the political pulpit, because he is possessed of the most genuine interest in engaging people, wherever he finds them, and joining the argument. On the Republican side he is matched by the likes of Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett, and Pat Buchanan. And when Mr. Clinton goes to church, one has the hunch that he goes because he knows he needs it. But his comings and goings in church also seem to offer another measure of the religious sensibility of our time. Apparently, the religious sense abroad in the land is of a God whose capacity for forgiveness is boundless, and whose demand for contrition is optional. What seems to be left out, conspicuously, is a God who would invite some serious testimony about the plan to amend one's life and confirm it in a new cast. If that understanding of God were dominant in the public mind, people might be moved to ask of Bill Clinton some rather searching questions. But it may be as some of us have begun to suspect, that Mr. Clinton is indeed a representative man of his age. He is, as he is, scaled to the current moral sensibility of the public, and to the notion of God that most people in the country think they can afford.

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N</font> his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton promised zero tolerance for those in government who ``cut corners and cut deals.'' But less than three years later the Justice Department cut a highly questionable deal with Arthur Coia, president of the mob-ridden Laborers International Union of North America, whose 700,000 members for the most part fill low-skilled construction jobs.
<P>
Corruption in the Laborers Union is an old and open book. As far back as 1978 a Justice Department report to the White House contended that the Chicago mob dominated Angelo Posco, then president of LIUNA, and in 1986 the President's Commission on Organized Crime, pointing to the looting of union benefit funds by the mob, death threats, and murders of opposing candidates, urged the Justice Department to file civil-racketeering charges. In 1988, the FBI announced a RICO investigation of LIUNA.
<P>
On November 4, 1994, the Justice Department delivered a draft of its 212-page RICO complaint to the Laborers: the key demand, Coia must go. The complaint chronicled a massive web of corruption that had continued for decades, with capos from an assortment of crime families either running locals directly or installing their appointees. LIUNA, it said, has been ``continuously and systematically controlled, exploited, and dominated in the conduct of its affairs by the Cosa Nostra.''
<P>
The complaint was unsparing concerning Coia personally. Four consecutive presidents of the union, including Coia, were ``controlled and influenced by organized-crime figures.'' Indeed, according to the complaint, Coia had tried (unsuccessfully) to replace the previous president in 1986 because he believed ``that [Angelo] Fosco's conduct harmed LIUNA and <I>the Cosa Nostra's control of LIUNA</I>'' (italics added). From 1986 to July 1994, the complaint charged, Coia had conspired with the Todaro crime family of Buffalo to transfer training funds of upstate New York locals to Buffalo, where the money would be used for the benefit of Cosa Nostra families and associates. (They were foiled when the victim-locals protested and a court upheld them against Coia.) Some of the material was old but nonetheless telling, like the 1981 indictment of Coia's father (who, as secretary-treasurer of the union, was second in command), New England mob boss Raymond Patriarca, and Coia himself for racketeering and taking bribes from an insurance swindler: it fizzled when the judge ruled the statute of limitations had expired.
<P>
Despite the damning indictment, within three months Justice had cut a deal: Coia could stay. In fact, Coia would be Justice's subcontractor to clean up the  union -- giving the ``appearance,'' in the delicate phrasing of Bill McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime, of putting the fox in charge of guarding the chicken coop. Why did Justice make such an unprecedented arrangement? The official explanation is that the government saved money that would otherwise have been wasted in lengthy litigation, and that Coia himself -- who was more knowledgeable? -- could root out the mob more efficiently. Indeed, Justice professed great pride in this pioneering method of dealing with union corruption, and Attorney General Janet Reno cited it as a model for future racket busting.
<P>
There is no doubt that Coia had wielded a canny combination of carrot and stick. He threatened an all-out fight in the courts if he personally were pushed out. Showing he meant business, he hired the firm of Williams & Connolly, which also represents President Clinton on Whitewater, to represent him in his negotiations with Justice. To represent LIUNA he hired Robert Luskin, himself a former Justice Department official. Luskin made an unusual offer on Coia's behalf: the union would hire him and a contingent of former FBI investigators to root out corruption. Moreover, Coia agreed to a consent decree acknowledging significant corruption in the union (which he had previously denied) that gave the Justice Department the option, until 1998, of putting LIUNA under trusteeship if it was not satisfied with Coia's progress.
<P>
Did Justice have other inducements to keep Coia in place? What has raised eyebrows is Coia's role as one of Clinton's most important political and financial allies. Coia has co-chaired a series of fund-raising dinners for the Democrats, each of which has raised millions of dollars. In 1994 alone, LIUNA contributed over a million dollars to Democratic candidates. It has become one of the largest donors of ``soft money'' to the Democratic Party. It even loaned $100,000 to Clinton's inaugural committee. Coia personally contributed $1,000 (the maximum permitted) to Clinton's Legal Defense Fund. He joined the board of the Back to Business Committee, where, humorously, he lent his moral authority to the committee's vigorous denials of merit in any of the ``character'' charges against the Clintons.
<P>
Money translated into social access. Soon the President and Coia were Bill and Arthur, eating breakfast together, exchanging gifts of specially made golf clubs. (The President's thank-you note for his arrived on Coia's desk the same day as the Justice Department's complaint.) Coia was invited to a small White House dinner where the President played the saxophone; a Judiciary subcommittee documented over 120 such contacts.
<P>
<font size=+3>D</font><font size=+1>ID</font> all this have any influence on the decision-making process at Justice? At hearings by Rep. McCollum's subcommittee at the end of July, Justice Department officials vigorously denied it and Democratic members of the committee indignantly insisted that there was absolutely no evidence of any White House interference.
<P>
Was there then only the <I>appearance</I> of a quid pro quo? Coia knew the Justice Department complaint was coming. There were obvious channels for a discreet phone call. The President and Coia were represented by the same law firm, and attorney - client privilege would forever protect such a channel of communications. Or Coia might have approached White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. According to Coia himself, the President had designated Ickes as his White House contact. Before taking his White House post, Ickes had represented a number of unions on mob-related charges, including the Laborers. Indeed the court-appointed trustee for a Teamsters local demanded that Ickes's firm withdraw as the local's counsel because of what it complained was its ``lack of independence'' from mob influence.
<P>
But even if there were no contacts between the White House and Justice, there did not have to be interference for there to be influence. Janet Reno's Justice Department has bent itself out of shape to be helpful to the President on Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Paulagate. The political appointees at Justice could not but be sensitive to the President's friendship with Coia. Last week, Ronald Fino, for 16 years an FBI informant within the Laborers on the Cosa Nostra, speaking behind a protective screen, warned McCollum's subcommittee that you can no longer tell a mobster by his fedora hat. ``Projecting an image of goodness, popping up and chairing charitable fund-raising functions combined with a voice for social justice, the racketeer builds a formidable defense against the Justice Department and prosecution.''
<P>
However the decision was made, and whatever the merits of the agreement between Justice and LIUNA -- and it is too soon to tell whether Coia will truly clean up the union or merely get rid of mob rivals -- several things are clear, all of them disquieting.
<P>
<blockquote>
1. Coia had a tremendous victory as he was transformed overnight from accused racketeer to racket-busting pioneer. In effect now endorsed by the Justice Department, he is a sure winner in the union elections in September and is thus guaranteed control of LIUNA until well after 1998, when Justice loses its power to intervene if dissatisfied with Coia's ``progress.'' Significantly, under terms of the agreement, LIUNA's $1-billion pension fund, the pot of gold which had been the mob's chief target, is off limits to the team of investigators Coia agreed to hire. Reform in this area, U.S. Attorney James Burns acknowledges, is ``up to the union.''
<P>
2. The President continued to lend Coia the prestige of his public friendship (including 24 White House visits) <I>after</I> he had been warned about the forthcoming Justice Department complaint. At the McCollum hearings, documents were produced showing that the FBI wrote the White House counsel's office in 1994 that Coia ``is a criminal associate of the New England Patriarca organized crime family'' and the subject of an FBI criminal probe. Another Justice Department memo that same year referred to Mrs. Clinton's staff having been warned, on the occasion of her planning to speak at a LIUNA conference, that ``we plan to portray him as a mob puppet.'' (Undeterred, in early 1995, while Coia was still fighting off the complaint, Mrs. Clinton went to Florida to address LIUNA's conference, Coia proudly accompanying her.)
<br>
Kenneth Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center, which focuses on ethical issues in government, says: ``The appearance problem is enormous here. In the case of a federal judge, a conflict of interest includes the appearance of a conflict of interest. The rationale is that the public should have confidence in its public institutions. If the President allows himself to be seen with a figure like this, it is a betrayal of public trust.''
<P>
3. Even as the Justice Department was chronicling the mob's wholesale pillaging of LIUNA's pension and training funds, departments of the Federal Government were providing the union with millions of dollars for ``training and education.'' A current study by the Heritage Foundation finds that in fiscal 1994 the EPA, HUD, Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services between them gave over $11 million to LIUNA, most of it as ``training funds.'' Bizarrely, the Department of Labor, in its annual Inspector General report, cites the prosecution of Michael LaBarbara for stealing training funds from a LIUNA local, while at the same time LIUNA received $475,000 more in, yes, training grants. The taxpayer hardly anticipates that government agencies will be showering discretionary funds on people with colorful nicknames.
<P>
One of the documents released by the McCollum committee shows just how far Coia thought he could go. At Coia's behest Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler sent a memo to both Harold Ickes, who oversees the Clinton campaign from the White House, and Debra DeLee, chief executive of the 1996 Democratic convention, urging them to consider giving Coia a speaking role at that convention.</blockquote>
<P>
Sorry, folks. With all the publicity, he won't be at the podium.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FIRST</font> defense of Clinton partisans against new revelations of corruption, illegality, and general wrongdoing in the Whitewater scandal is to point out that it all occurred a long time ago, before Mr. Clinton was elected President. By implication if not overtly, Mr. Clinton's behavior as President is held to be above suspicion.
<P>
Unfortunately for the tactic, the Clintons seem to attract scandal the way Newt Gingrich attracts controversy. And this tendency didn't stop with Whitewater. Here is a brief list of Clinton scandal since Inaugural Day 1993:
<P>
<B>Filegate:</B> The President's director of personnel security, Craig Livingstone, was caught collecting <I>hundreds</I> of secret FBI files on Reagan and Bush Administration officials. President Clinton, who disclaims familiarity with the facts, nonetheless asserts that this was merely ``a bureaucratic snafu.'' FBI director Louis Freeh -- whose agency complied with the White House's extraordinary requests for these files -- calls it a ``massive'' and ``egregious'' violation of privacy rights. Prosecutors and Congress want to know, among other things, who hired Livingstone and whether he acted on his own, as White House spokesmen claim. Two FBI special agents assigned to the White House insist they were told that Hillary Clinton was Livingstone's patron. While the First Lady has a finger in most White House appointments, including the chef, chief usher, head of the correspondence unit, and Secret Service detail, she denies any association with Livingstone. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will have to sort this out. He will probably invite Mrs. Clinton to testify a second time, under oath, before the grand jury.
<P>
<B>State Department files:</B> The first time Clinton officials were found rifling through files was at the State Department; 160 personnel files of former Bush officials were collected, and disparaging information from two of the files was leaked to the <I>Washington Post</I>. The State Department's inspector general found that this conduct probably violated the Privacy Act. He referred the case to Attorney General Janet Reno for possible criminal prosecution. Miss Reno chose not to pursue the matter.
<P>
<B>Travelgate:</B> The first time Clinton officials misused the FBI was when they concocted criminal charges against the director of the White House Travel Office, Billy Dale. This was done to throw lucrative government travel business to two of the Clintons' Hollywood friends and campaign supporters. Dale, who had worked for Republican and Democratic Presidents, was forced to spend $500,000 on his defense. He was eventually prosecuted on charges of embezzlement by the Clinton Justice Department, but found not guilty after less than two hours of jury deliberation. Independent Counsel Starr is looking into whether former presidential aide David Watkins lied to government investigators to cover up Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travel Office firings. Watkins's own notes show that the First Lady ordered the firings, but Mrs. Clinton has told investigators she had no role in them. Again, she can be expected to give sworn testimony about this to the grand jury.
<P>
<b>The Clinton Cabinet:</B> The Clintons are not the only Administration officials being investigated by an independent counsel. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was forced to resign, is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes from Tyson Foods, Inc., the giant Arkansas poultry company. Of course, the Tysons have been prominent supporters of Mr. Clinton's political career. Moreover, Tyson Foods' top lawyer, James Blair, helped Mrs. Clinton turn a $1,000 cattle-futures investment into $100,000 in less than a year. (Mrs. Clinton originally claimed that her superior financial skills were learned from the pages of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; in truth, this remarkable investment has never been fully explained.)
<P>
An independent counsel is investigating whether HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros lied to the FBI during his background investigation about the size and number of payments he made to his former mistress. And before his tragic death, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was being investigated for, among other things, possible financial irregularities.
<P>
<B>The Clinton Sub-Cabinet:</B> Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell -- Mrs. Clinton's former partner in the Rose Law Firm -- is now imprisoned at Cumberland Federal Penitentiary. He was convicted of defrauding some of his clients. Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum resigned after he interfered with Justice Department lawyers' efforts to search the late Vince Foster's office. Former Associate White House Counsel William Kennedy resigned over tax problems and his role in the Travel Office firings. Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and former Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson resigned after it was learned that they had tipped off the President's staff that the Resolution Trust Corporation was sending criminal referrals involving the Clintons to the Justice Department.
<P>
<B>Health Care Task Force:</B> As head of the task force, Mrs. Clinton insisted that the group's meetings be closed to all but six hundred carefully selected government and industry officials who shared her goal of nationalizing America's health-care system. Mrs. Clinton and the task force were sued by three organizations claiming that the secret meetings violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. A federal court agreed. Moreover, during the litigation, the presiding judge, Royce Lamberth, became concerned that certain Administration officials may have provided false and misleading information to the court. Judge Lamberth is currently considering whether to bring sanctions against any of these officials.
<P>
<B>Paula Jones:</B> Paula Jones's allegations of sexual harassment by Bill Clinton go back before his Presidency. But his legalistic contortions to evade a trial are a minor scandal in themselves. Incidentally, the Clinton lawyer who alleged that Billy Dale's willingness to have his lawyers plea-bargain was a sign of guilt might want to ponder the fact that the President's lawyers held negotiations with Paula Jones's team on the terms under which she would withdraw her suit. Mr. Clinton maintains that the Constitution immunizes him from civil suits involving allegations of personal misconduct that occurred before he became President. Of course, no such immunity exists. At one time Mr. Clinton claimed immunity as a member of the armed forces. Public outcry caused him to beat a quick retreat from that argument. Recently the Supreme Court agreed to consider the President's immunity claim, thereby delaying the case until after the election.
<P>
<B>Whitewater:</B> While Whitewater per se occurred before the Clintons came to Washington, actions that look like cover-up attempts have taken place in the White House. Last summer, for example, critical Rose Law Firm billing records, containing information about Mrs. Clinton's apparent legal work on the Castle Grande real-estate scam, were discovered outside the First Lady's personal office in the White House residence. The records, sought by lawmen since 1994, were not turned over until this January. Mrs. Clinton has steadfastly denied providing legal advice on Castle Grande. Furthermore, she denies knowing the whereabouts of the long-sought billing records prior to their discovery. Mrs. Clinton was required to give her testimony to the grand jury this January. Since then, the FBI found her fingerprints on the records.

<title>Economic Effects From Universal, Unlimited IRAs</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>The Economic Effects Of Legislation Enacting
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</center></h1>
<p>
<pre>

			Increase in GDP			Additional Jobs
	Year		(In $ Billions)		 	 (In Thousands)
        ----            ---------------			---------------

	1996			  153				  489
	2000			  418				1,182
	2010			1,090				1,936
	2020			2,158				2,377
	2030			4,246				2,897
	2040			8,352				3,532
	2060		       32,318				5,078
</pre>
The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures represent the change in nominal 
GDP relative to the baseline for that year.  For example, GDP will be 
$2.2 trillion higher in the year 2020 than it would otherwise be in the 
adsence of universal IRAs.  And, by the year 2020, there will be 2.4 
million more jobs in that year than in the absence of universal IRAs.  By 
the year 2060, the increase in GDP from universal, unlimited, 
tax-deductible IRAs will be $32 trillion in excess of GDP otherwise 
available, and 5 million more jobs will be created than otherwise 
available.<br>
<p>
The estimated economic effects illustrated in the above table assume that 
the assets held within universal IRA-type accounts without any penalty 
tax on distribution would have a maximum holding period of just five 
years, and that each contribution would be uniformly withdrawn over five 
years.  In other words, on average, each dollar contributed to the IRA 
would be withdrawn at a rate of 20% per year. (<i>The maximum assumed 
holding period of five years indicates a weighted average holding 
period of 2 1/2 years.  It is the League's view that over a period 
of time such a weighted average holding period will be low and thus 
the assumption is quite conservative.</i>)<br> 
<p>
Since the duration of the average holding period is a determinant of 
gains to be derived from universal IRAs, a sensitivity test indicates 
that if the five-year assumed holding period was increased or decreased 
by just one year, the aggregate IRA assets would be increased by 15%-20% 
within ten years.  It is estimated that adding just one year to the 
assumed holding period would ultimately reduce the effective personal 
income tax rate on savings by 60%.<br>
<p>
<h3><i>Clearly, it is in the interests of everyone, including the 
government, to encourage maximum tax-deductible IRA saving to be held for 
the longest duration possible.</i></h3><br>

derived from the enactment of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type 
legislation.  The study was completed in 1993 and all subsequent yearly 
figures were calculated assuming the enacted legislation would have 
occurred in 1993.<br>

<title>Estimated Revenue Gains and Losses From Universal IRAs</title>

</pre>
<p>
The above estimates of the governments's static revenue estimates for 
universal IRAs show a substantial loss in federal revenue.  However, the
estimates also indicate that the dynamic economic results flowing from 
universal IRAs will create sufficient added tax revenues to more than 
offset the static losses.  For example, in the year 2000, the extra tax 
revenue from the expanded, dynamic economic growth will more than offset 
the $67 billion in forgone ordinary income taxes.  With the gap growing 
each year, by the year 2060, the net dynamic federal tax revenue gain in 
excess of static revenue loss from the ordinary income tax will be in 
excess of $2.3 trillion.<br>
<p>
Forecasting the GDP growth for the next sixty five years, it is estimated 
that the net present-value of our nation's GDP to be derived from 
universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs is almost $6.3 trillion dollars 
greater than it would be in the absence of this legislation.<br>

<title>Universal IRAs Increase After-Tax Incomes</title> <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>How Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs Will Increase 
After-Tax Incomes In the Year 2000</center></h1>

	     200,000 - 500,000				3.3%
	     500,000 or more				5.8%

</pre>
In the year 2000, it is estimated that the after-tax income of taxpayers, 
under its current definition, will be increased by $151 billion due to 
the added growth generated by universal IRAs.  Furthermore, most of that 
gain in after-tax income - 85% - will go to taxpayers with incomes under 
$100,000, and over 60% will go to people with $50,000 or less of adjusted 
gross income.  Additionally, the bulk of the percentage change in 
after-tax incomes will flow to those taxpayers with adjusted gross 
incomes between $10,000 and $100,000.  The percentage increase in the 
after-tax income for taxpayers within these classes ranges between 12% 
and 23%.<br>
<p>
The above table clearly portrays a dramatic improvement in everyone's 
standard of living, <i>and particularly those in middle-income 
America</i>.  These results, which will grow as the IRA assets grow, are 
directly derived from the enactment of universal IRA legislation.<br>

<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for your
invitation to testify on the Contract With America provisions
that are designed to encourage greater saving and investing. 
We support these goals.  However, it is our strong view that the
Contract does not go far enough to properly correct the existing,
extremely serious tax bias against saving.
<P>
Others on this panel, as well as many other panels in many other
Congresses, have made proper, impassioned pleas for Congress to
restore and expand tax-deductible IRAs, as well as to reduce the
negative impact of the capital gains tax on saving and investing.
Basically, these pleas have been shunted aside by Congress for
two erroneous reasons:  (1) the allegation that they cost too
much in lost tax revenue; and (2) they're perceived by some as
tax loopholes for the rich.
<P>
In the League's judgment, both of these arguments are totally
specious.  These arguments are contrary to the government's own
fiscal interests, as well as being contrary to the taxpayer's,
and our nation's, financial well-being.  Further, removing the
income tax bias <I>against</I> saving does <I>not</I> mean that
such removal is biased <I>for</I> saving.  The resulting taxation
becomes &quot;neutral.&quot;
<P>
It is important to state at the outset that all economists agree
that the ordinary income tax is biased against saving.  The question
is-how much bias?  Is this bias harmful?  To help understand this
bias and its magnitude, Table 1 utilizes two tax brackets to better
illustrate the impact of the ordinary income tax on saving, and
how this cancerous tax eats away at the government's tax revenue.
An actual mutual fund was used for this factual illustration.<p>
<b><center>The Impact of Income Tax Bias On Tax Revenues</b></center>
<p><UL>
<LI>In Table 1, two taxpayers' $100 of income (wage) were taxed
at 15% or 50%, respectively.  The after-tax balance ($85 and $50)
was invested in the mutual fund.  Each end-of-year fund distribution
was taxed to the taxpayer as shown, with the balance reinvested.
This investment was maintained from 1926 to 1992, for a sixty-seven
year duration.  The investment and tax impact during similar durations
in the future will not reflect a significant difference from those
portrayed herein.  Thus, the past is prologue.

(# Includes the 1992 tax on realized gain when the fund
is sold  Note that the long string of government tax collections
from saving would never have occurred if the taxpayers had consumed
(spent) their $85 or $50 net-after-tax income.  It is this second
tier of year after year taxation that produces the income tax
bias against saving.</h6>
<p><UL>
<LI>Obviously, the taxes collected each year bounced around from
year to year.  This reflects the investment climate of the times,
as the U.S. went through good times and bad times, including the
worst depression and World War II.<p>
<LI>Note that as time went on, the expected larger tax revenues
each year from the high bracket taxpayer vs. the low bracket taxpayer
gradually narrowed.  This narrowing spread of tax revenues from
the higher and lower tax bracket taxpayers continued until the
30th year.  <I>From that point forward, the government increasingly
collected more tax revenue from the 15% bracket taxpayer then
from the 50% bracket taxpayer!  </I>
<P>
<LI>These tax revenue losses from the high bracket taxpayer vs.
the low bracket taxpayer continued to grow progressively from
year to year, and culminated in an even larger loss when each
taxpayer sold their fund in the 67th year, and the investment's
unrealized gain was realized and taxed.</ul><p>
<b><center>Valid Conclusions To Be Drawn From Table 1</b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The income tax bias against saving is shocking.  The longer
you save, the worse it becomes, and the government's tax base
related to saving gets smaller.<p>
<LI>There is no escape.  Selling one investment to buy another
usually triggers more tax.  Thus, the government's tax base is
reduced from that point forward, forever.  And, the ever-diminishing
tax base, over what it would be otherwise, is effectively passed
on from one taxpayer to another as savings and investments are
transferred.<p>
<LI>Don't be misled by the fact that when taxes are paid, the
related savings or investment may or may not be liquidated to
pay the tax.  The source of funds to pay the tax may come from
elsewhere.  Regardless, the capital that's otherwise available
for future taxation is reduced by the amount of the tax.<p>
<LI>By increasing tax rates on saving to escape this tax receipts
dilemma, the government wipes out its tax base faster, thereby
eventually collecting less and less tax revenue.<p>
<LI>This tax bias against saving occurs regardless of whether
the return on saving is interest, dividends, or realized capital
gain.<p>
<LI>Is it any wonder that our taxpayers and our government increasingly
feel that they're on a fiscal treadmill that's always accelerating
without forward progress?  They are!  Raising income tax rates
on saving only makes the treadmill move faster, and the problem
gradually gets worse.<p>
<LI>Taxpayers may come and go, but their year-by-year losses of
capital due to the income tax on saving can never be replaced.
Thus, the government's tax base related to saving perpetually
shrinks from what it would otherwise be if this pernicious and
needless tax bias were not present.  Is it any wonder that governments
gradually fail due to fiscal exhaustion?  Ratcheting up taxes
on saving only hastens the demise.  <I>Think about it.</I></UL>
<P>
If the facts in Table 1 don't make your hair stand on end, what
happens to taxpayers' saving under the ordinary income tax will
make your hair curl.  See below.
<p>
<b><center>The Impact of the Income Tax Bias On Saving</b></center>
<P>
Having observed how taxes gradually gnawed away at the government's
tax base over the past sixty-seven years, let's look at how each
taxpayer's investment fared under the ordinary income tax over
the same period of time.<P>

<table border><caption><b>Table 2: Taxpayers' After-Tax Mutual<br>Fund Values On 
12/31/92</b> </caption>
<th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<td>$49,052 <td>$4,598<tr>
</table><p>
In order to evaluate the impact of the income tax that created
these after-tax values, it is proper to measure the value of each
taxpayer's $100 of pre-tax income if it could have been invested
in the mutual fund <I>without any tax</I>.  This value then becomes
a proper benchmark value against which the impact of any tax methodology
may be measured.
<pre>			Table 3:Benchmark Values

	Each Taxpayer's Mutual Fund Values On 12/31/92

	From $100 Investment Without Tax = $120,649
</pre><p>
When one measures the taxpayers' after-tax values in Table 2 vs.
the Benchmark Values of Table 3, each taxpayer's values are the
following percentage of Benchmark Values (Table 2 &#247; Table
3):<p>
<table border><caption><b>Table 4: After-Tax Values As A % Of Benchmark 
Values</b></caption> <th>15% Taxpayer <th>50% Taxpayer<tr>
<th>41% <td>4%<tr>
</table><p>
In short, the 15% taxpayer lost 59% of his benchmark values due
to the ordinary income tax.  That's four times his tax bracket!
The 50% taxpayer lost 96% of his benchmark values!  Such tax
bias against saving amounts to outrageous, idiotic confiscation
worthy of tax revolt!  <I>It must be stopped immediately!  </I>The
tax grievances leading to the Boston Tea Party pale in comparison.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax is grossly biased against saving.
If these taxpayers hadn't saved, their after-tax spending would
have been 85% and 50% of their before-tax income, respectively,
not 41% and 4% of their unbiased, benchmark values.  Not only
are taxpayers grievously abused by this income tax on saving,
as shown above, the government's own tax base is needlessly and
scandalously whittled away by the ordinary income tax, as shown
in Table 1.<p>
<b><center>Tax-Deductible IRA-Type Plans</b></center>
<P>
Now, let us measure the tax treatment of tax-deductible IRA-type
plans.<p>

<LI>Upon the IRA withdrawal, the government not only recaptured

out of their <I>own</I> pocket to their tax-deductible IRAs. 
The remaining part of the $100 contribution (i.e., $15 and $50)
represented the government's deferred tax.  Thus, upon withdrawal
on 12/31/92, the taxpayers received <I>their portion</I> of the
IRA contribution ($85 &amp; $50), plus the full investment growth
thereon, <I>without further tax</I>.  For example-

</pre><p>
<UL>
<LI>It is important to recognize that tax-deductible saving is
<I>neutral</I> taxation, and it is fair to all taxpayers, regardless
of their tax bracket.  Each taxpayer defers otherwise taxable
income.  This tax deferral is subsequently taxed upon a withdrawal,
at which time it is taxed at progressive, ordinary income tax
rates.  What is avoided is the senseless, self-defeating second
layer of ordinary income tax that's imposed on the taxpayer's
investment income and realized gain.<p>
<LI>With tax-deductible IRA-type plans, all taxpayers effectively
enjoy a <I>zero</I> tax rate on <I>their own portion</I> of their
contribution to the IRA, e.g., the $85 and $50 illustrated above.
This is the same amount that would have been consumed (spent)
if it had not been saved via the tax-deductible IRA-type plan.
Thus, for this &quot;spending&quot; amount that is saved and
invested, tax-deductible IRAs produce a zero tax on realized capital
gain and a zero tax on dividend and interest income.  This is
proper, neutral taxation, and every taxpayer, regardless of tax
bracket, is treated fairly. 
</ul>
<P>
Surely, too, and properly so, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type
plans are more favorable, simpler, and more fiscally sound than
reducing the capital gains tax and indexing the asset basis for
inflation.  While reducing the capital gains tax is also very
appealing and very sound, such a partial removal of the income
tax bias against such saving is not the best course to follow.
<p>
<b><center>Measuring The Cost Of IRAs</b></center>
<P>
Government tax policy is driven by staff revenue estimates.  IRAs
are staff-labeled as &quot;tax-expenditures&quot; and staff-described
as being &quot;most similar to those direct spending programs
which have no spending limits, and which are available as entitlements
to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the programs.&quot;
They liken it to Medicare, Social Security, etc.!  <I>Nothing
could be more inaccurate than those staff descriptions!</I>  
<P>
IRA-type tax deductions are not &quot;spendings,&quot; they're
voluntary savings!  The government's tax analysis faces 180_ in
the wrong direction!  This leads to Committee decisions and government
tax policy that is also faced 180_ in the wrong direction!
<P>
As illustrated with tax-deductible IRA-type plans, the government
gets back every nickel of the tax deduction, plus growth thereon,
at free-market rates of total return!  The alleged revenue loss
the government incurs is the second layer of tax that it should
not impose in the first place, because it is progressively destructive
to the government's tax receipts and imposes confiscatory taxation
on all taxpayers who save!  <I>And &quot;saving&quot; is the life
blood of any progressive civilization. </I>
<P>
Even the government's 1995 Budget document demonstrates that its
&quot;tax expenditure&quot; revenue estimates for tax policy deliberations
are grossly misleading.  For example:
<p><pre>
	Table 8: U.S. Budget Analytical Perspectives-Fiscal Year 1995
			1994 Tax Expenditure Loss From IRAs
			-----------------------------------
	
	1994 Tax Expenditure 		$5.415 Million

	*Discounted Present-Value
	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 	$1.735 Million

	*This figure had never been disclosed before
</pre><p>

The above $5.4 million IRA tax expenditure corresponds to the
Joint Committee on Taxation figures that are used by the Ways
&amp; Means Committee in their tax policy deliberations.  However,
the <I>present-value figure</I> reflects the more realistic fact
that all IRA tax <I>deductions</I> are recovered by the government
with free-market rates of growth thereon!  In effect, therefore,
the government admits that its tax expenditure figures used for
Committee tax policy deliberations are over three times too high
when measured on a more realistic basis ($5.4 &#247; $1.7 = $3.3)!
 Further, the $1.7 million present-value figure represents the
senseless and self-defeating second layer of tax that should never
be imposed in the first place.
<P>
A few years ago, a highly respected Washington, DC, actuary analyzed
the government's methodology in determining tax expenditures relating
to tax deferred saving.  His conclusion was &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost
useless for budget purposes...Any tax law based on such arbitrary
and capricious figures can only be good by accident.&quot;  Amen.
<P>
In short, universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving (as found
in the bipartisan H.R. 328, the Individual Investment Account
Act) totally removes the income tax bias against saving.  It is
very important to recognize and accept the fact that such tax-deductible
saving represents <I>neutrality</I> in regards to the basic taxpayer
decision of whether to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;consume&quot;
income.  Thus, the removal of the tax bias against saving via
H.R. 328, <I>does</I> <I>not</I> mean that such removal favors
saving over consumption; it <I>does not</I>, it is neutral.
<P>
Clearly, when the question is raised as to the cost of enacting
tax-deductible saving legislation, the paramount question is quite
different-namely, what's the cost of the existing, unrelenting
fiscal drag on the economy that arises from the existing tax bias
against saving?  Common sense and rational tax revenue estimation
clearly show that eliminating the income tax bias on saving can
only be positive, not negative, legislation.<p>
<b><center>The Tax Revenue Impact of Unlimited, Tax-Deductible Saving
<br>As Proposed in H.R. 328</b></center>
<P>
The League strongly supports H.R. 328 (and S. 159, its companion
bill in the Senate) that provides for universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type &quot;investment accounts.&quot;  This legislation also
includes the removal of other senseless biases against saving
usually found with existing IRAs, such as penalty taxes, forced
distributions, etc.  See the summary of H.R. 328, attached.
<P>
To illustrate the fiscal impact of H.R. 328, the well-known and
respected economics advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, in 1993
prepared an economic forecast of the revenue aspects of H.R. 328
on two bases:  <I>static</I> (government method) and <I>dynamic</I>
(a far more rational method for measuring the impact of taxes
on saving).<p>

*The above net present-value calculations assume a discount rate
of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society given
by a long-term return on mutual funds.  The favorable swing (i.e.,
loss to gain:  -b to +a) in estimated revenues is mind-boggling
(e.g., $136 billion in year 2000)!  A copy of the complete Fiscal
Associates report is available to you upon request.

Fiscal Associates' forecasted results also portray a dramatic
increase in taxpayers' after-tax income and related standard of
living that will flow from the prompt enactment of H.R. 328.

<P>
<I>Note how middle-income America will enjoy the bountiful fruits
of unlimited, tax-deferred saving and free-market enterprise that
flows from unlimited, tax-deductible saving via the enactment
of H.R. 328.</I>
<P>
The above positive fiscal results can not be ignored by Congress,
nor the public.  While there may be differences among economists
as to the efficacy of dynamic vs. static scoring and the underlying
assumptions and methods, the &quot;dynamic&quot; results are not
only dramatically favorable, <I>they do reflect common sense and
a far more rational method of estimating the program's fiscal
results.</I>  
<P>
H.R. 328 is bottomed on plain common sense and reflects the economic
facts of life that when you reduce the costs of saving, you get
more of it.  Further, H.R. 328 induced-saving is always measurable
and held in trust for productive, free-market investment that
will grow to everyone's advantage, including the government's,
as it collects its taxes on the enhanced values at ordinary income
tax rates when benefits are paid.  Compounding this tax collection
growth are the added taxes arising from enhanced GDP and the broad
based increase in taxes generated thereby.
<P>
It is important to recognize that unlimited, tax-deductible saving
<I>without</I> penalty taxes, forced distributions, and no income
nor estate tax at death, will greatly increase the propensity
of most taxpayers to save increasing amounts over that which they
would save under the biased-against-saving ordinary income tax.
New saving and increased saving have no offsets to eventual government
tax receipts, because, by definition, these amounts of saving
would have otherwise been spent, thereby forgoing any further
enhanced tax receipts by the government via personal, free-market
investment growth.
<P>
Similarly, to the extent that the &quot;new saving&quot; portion
of a taxpayer's tax-deductible contribution matches or exceeds
his or her tax bracket (e.g., when 15% or more of the tax-deductible
contribution represents <I>new</I> saving for a 15% tax bracket
taxpayer), that new saving portion will match or exceed the government's
borrowing that's needed to replace the temporary loss of revenue
from tax deferral.  Thus, net national saving is maintained or
enhanced.<p>
<b><center>Conclusion</b></center>
<P>
There is no rational reason to defer an aggressive Congressional
push to enact universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving as proposed
by H.R. 328.  To the extent that existing budgetary rules, or
precedents for tax revenue estimation methods, if any, appear
to impede the consideration and enactment of H.R. 328, it is most
appropriate to very seriously consider their inapplicability and
their inappropriateness to this legislation.  Surely, sound, vital
legislation that increases personal saving within the U.S., as
well as the government's tax revenue receipts derived therefrom,
must not be held hostage to rules and precedents that are inappropriate
and self-defeating to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
The 1994 election reflects a strong voter/taxpayer demand for
a bipartisan government to be bold and sensible in removing the
dead-weight burden of irrational, self-defeating government from
their backs.  The anti-saving bias of the ordinary income tax
is a classic example of faulty government, and it must be removed.
 H.R. 328 is a most attractive, sound way to show that this Committee
and Congress is thoughtful and resolute in seeking proper solutions
to our nation's economic problems.
<P>
We appreciate your request that we testify on this most important
matter.  On behalf of savers and investors, and their vital interests
in the fiscal soundness of our government, we thank you for your
serious interest.  As always, action is what counts.
<P>
<B>SUMMARY OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT ACCOUNT ACT, H.R. 328</B>
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions from any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>Tax-free investment growth until withdrawal.<p>
<LI>All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.<p>
<LI>No penalty tax on any withdrawal.<p>
<LI>No forced distribution at any age.<p>
<LI>With all withdrawals being taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
there is no rational need for income tax nor estate tax at death.
Beneficiary can maintain the account and assumes the benefactor's
tax basis, if any.<p>
<LI>Principal Residence Rollovers:<p>
<ul><LI>Home Purchase:  Up to $15,000-indexed for inflation-of otherwise
taxable distributions may be rolled over from the account without
tax for first purchase of principal residence.  However, the tax
basis of residence is reduced by like amount.<p>
<LI>Home Sale:  Proceeds from sale of a principal residence may
be rolled over into the investment account without tax.  The tax
basis of the account is thereupon adjusted to reflect the tax
basis of former residence, plus the existing law's $125,000 exemption
on the home's sale after age 55.<p>
<LI>This home sale rollover provision is particularly attractive
to &quot;empty nesters&quot; who won't sell their home due to
the income tax on the gain that mainly arises from inflation.
This provision lets them roll over an unproductive asset (home)
for productive investments in the account.  Thus, they may be
able to live better in retirement.  The government will probably
make money on this, because otherwise the &quot;empty nester&quot;
may opt for a &quot;stepped-up basis&quot; for his home upon death.
This rollover provision is a valuable option for many people.
</ul><p>
<LI>Tax-deductible premiums for life insurance are an acceptable
investment within the account, provided the proceeds are payable
into the account for investment therein and eventual taxable distribution.

<center>
<font size=4><b><a name="top">Summary</a> Statement of W. Thomas Kelly, President<br>
SAVERS &amp; INVESTORS LEAGUE</b></font><br>
<font size=3><b>Before the Ways &amp; Means Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
on<br>
January 31, 1995</b></font><br>
</center>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting
me to comment on those provisions of the Contract With America
that are designed to encourage savings and investment.  The League's
views may be summarized by three important points.
<p>
<b><center>Our First Important Point:</b></center> 
<p>
First, we support the Contract's American Dream Savings
Account provision.  It is certainly a move in the right direction.
However, in our view, these provisions do not go far enough.
Legislation should be adopted promptly to fully remove the ordinary
income tax bias against saving.  
<P>
This cancerous tax bias is a constant, progressive drain on the
fiscal soundness of our government and on the economic growth
of our nation.  This tax bias must be removed- totally.
<P>
This total removal is accomplished by (1) allowing unlimited
tax deductions and tax deferrals for IRA-type saving; (2) income
taxes would be imposed only upon any plan withdrawal at then existing
progressive tax rates, like wages; and (3) there would be no penalty
taxes nor forced distribution at any age.  
<P>
These three, simple, basic criteria are embodied in the bipartisan
Individual Investment Account Act of 1995 (H.R. 328), as sponsored
by Mr. McCrery of this Committee, and S. 159 sponsored by Senator
Breaux of the Finance Committee.
<p>
<b><center>Our Second Important Point:</b></center>
<p>
Our second important point is that no consideration of
how to improve our nation's rate of saving can ignore the staff
procedures for measuring the alleged &quot;tax expenditure costs&quot;
of IRAs.  These staff procedures are so flawed that the Committee's
tax policy considerations are seriously compromised.  
<P>
Even the Treasury Department's 1995 Budget document, for the
first time ever, disclosed that its tax expenditure figures for
IRAs were overstated by over three times when measured on a more
rational, realistic basis.  And, even these severely reduced costs
continue to reflect the self-defeating second layer of tax on
saving that should not be imposed upon our government, our taxpayers,
and our nation.
<P>
Much debate arises over static vs. dynamic scoring of the alleged
costs of IRA-type plans.  Static scoring stands logic and sound
tax policy on its head.  For example, it assumes that IRA tax
deductions are an expense rather than creating a government asset.
The dynamic scoring of IRAs is fiscally sound and entirely proper.
<P>
The dynamic scoring of H.R. 328 by well-respected economists
show that tax receipts grow quickly, and become progressively
larger each year over those otherwise collected under the ordinary
income tax.  
<P>
These increasing tax receipts reflect the growth in saving, in
production, in GDP and in jobs; and the resulting reduction in
the cost of capital brought about by unlimited, tax-deductible
saving.  
 
<P>
And, because the gains arising from increased capital flow
in very large measure to labor, it is estimated that unlimited,
tax-deductible saving will increase the after-tax income
of <I>all</I> middle-income taxpayers by 12% to 23% within six
or seven years following enactment.
<p>
<b><center>Our Third Important Point:</b></center>
<p> 
Our third important point is to recognize that unlimited,
tax-deductible IRA-type plans are <I>not</I> tax loopholes for
the rich.  The full removal of the income tax bias against saving
not only restores the taxation of saving to one of proper neutrality
in terms of saving vs. consumption, it is also neutral in regards
to the taxation of realized capital gain vs. dividends or interest
income.
<P>
Unlimited, tax-deductible, tax-deferred saving is not
a favoring of savers in any tax bracket; it is solely one of restoring
fiscally sound tax neutrality at all tax brackets.
<p>
<center><b>Summary</b></center>

<P>
In summary, the removal of only a portion of the tax bias
against saving, as found in the American Dream Savings Account
legislation, is only a partial correction of the tax bias
against saving when a full correction is both imperative
and sound.
<P>
The unlimited, tax-deductible Individual Investment Accounts of
H.R. 328 are tax revenue gainers, not losers. Thus, there is no reason, other than 
an irrational, existing staff scoring dogma, to deny our nation, including
all taxpayers and our government, the singular advantages
that will flow from this sound legislation.
<P>
The League urges the Committee to thoroughly explore the economic
growth and rational tax revenue implications of H.R. 328.

<font size=4>NEW CONGRESS: IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID </font></center>
<p>
Washington, D.C., December 15, 1994 - Our nation is in a &quot;saving&quot;  crisis. 
This crisis is self-inflicted due to the erroneous way our government measures
alleged tax revenue loss from tax-deferred plans like IRAs. 
<p>
In short, the government treats IRA tax deferrals as an expense, when in reality,
the tax deferrals, by their very nature, are government assets.  Certainly, every
IRA owner recognizes that he or she has a tax liability if and when an IRA
withdrawal is ma de.  It's obvious that when the taxpayer has a liability to the
government, the government has an asset of like amount.  That's not and expense! 

Does this governmental error make a difference?  Absolutely-and the cost to
taxpayers, our nation, our economy, and to the government's tax collections, is
mind boggling high! 

The respected economic advisory firm, Fiscal Associates, prepared an analysis that
measured the future fiscal effects of legislation that allows any person to have
unlimited tax deductions for any IRA contributions.  See Table 1. </PRE>

<h6> *The net present-value calculations
assume a discount rate of 11.6 percent-the estimated rate of return to society
given by a long-term return on mutual funds.  This study was prepared in 1993 and
published in Wealth Is Not A Dirty Word, Mill Run Press, P aoli, PA.  The swing
(i.e., loss to gain) in estimated revenues (b-a) is mind boggling (e.g., $136
billion in year 2000)! 
</h6>
The government measures tax revenue on the unrealistic &quot;static&quot; basis
shown above, i.e., the government assumes people don't change their actions when
tax laws are changed, and ignores expanded tax collections from a soundly growing
economy.  [R emember how a static estimate raised taxes on boats, thereby killing
hobs and losing tax revenue?] The &quot;dynamic&quot; basis reflects the realistic
fact that people respond to tax law changes.  In this case, new net saving will
grow dramatically. 
<p>
Increased saving, created by unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would increase
production, increase jobs, reduce interest costs, and increase tax revenue. 
Taxpayers after-tax income (and related standard of living) by the year 
2000 would be increased as shown in Table 2. </PRE>

Clearly, Congress must immediately put a stop using the thoroughly discredited
static &quot;tax expenditure&quot; method for estimation tax revenues from
tax-deferred plans such as IRAs.  The static method directs governmental tax policy
180 degrees in th e wrong direction.  Without changing any other provision of the
law, correctly measuring the tax impact of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs would
swiftly increase the after-tax income of middle America by 12% to 20%! 
<p>

On November 8th, the American people voted for rational, substantive change, not
just slogans.  There's no sounder change than H.R. 3179 and S. 929 (103rd
Congress).  These identical bills achieve the desired results portrayed above and
will be reintroduc ed in the 104th Congress. 
<p>

Every caring American should write his or her Representative and Senators now and
urge immediate enactment.  There is no reason for delay.  Every day of delay makes
matters worse.

<P>
Congress, as well as the current (and former) Administration, feel compelled to raise taxes,
coupled with illusionary spending cuts.  Voter/taxpayers are sick and tired, to the point of
revulsion, of the hackneyed demagoguery that always accompanies every budget debate.
  The claim is always made that the sky will fall unless taxes are raised.  Don't elected officials 
ever feel sick from being forced to participate in such a mindless exercise?
<P>
Grass roots voter/taxpayers are awakening to the fact that raising taxes has never, repeat never, cut
 our nation's deficit or debt.  Surely, members of Congress must know this, too.  As all Americans 
with common sense know, only enhanced private saving and private enterprise, coupled with 
governmental spending restraint, can reduce our nation's true deficit and debt.  Federal taxes are not only far too high, they impose a double, even triple tax on saving.
<P>
It is time for every member of Congress, as the elected representative of his or her constituents, to break away from the arcane and incredibly erroneous governmental revenue estimations that have no credibility whatsoever, except among
government people.  They blithely forecast deficit and debt reduction, when realism shows the exact
opposite.  Every member's vote on this important budget and tax matter should reflect plain common sense, not a blind 
acceptance of budgetary legerdemain that cannot be explained nor defended to constituents.
<P>
Regardless of party affiliation, a vote for common sense budget policy will: (a) reject the 
present budget package; and (b) subsequently focus on real, current spending cuts
 and a tax and budget policy that will enhance personal saving and investment, not destroy them.
<P>
It's important to recognize that when people save (regardless of tax bracket), they are placing their savings on the marketplace for others to use. 
 Obviously, the others (in all walks of life and in all tax brackets) who use this saving expect to profit therefrom, while paying for its use.  The 
dynamics of such &quot;free market&quot; capitalism builds upon itself.  
This is what makes nations prosper, 
thereby creating real jobs at all levels.  Clearly, saving should only be taxed once - when it's 
consumed (spent).
<P>
Thus, taxing such saving before it is consumed not only destroys the taxpayers' return, it removes badly needed 
private capital from the marketplace, thereby concurrently destroying the 
government's &quot;private savings&quot; tax base as
 well.  This is a surefire recipe for gradual economic strangulation, not only at the personal and family 
levels, but at the national level as well.
<P>
Our nation is now feeling the ever-tightening economic noose around its neck.

 capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall be a deduction from  
 gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible

   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net

         losses properly taken into account for the portion of the  
         taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, and  
           `(B) if the net capital gain for such year exceeds the

  (b) Employer Reversions of Excess Pension Assets Permitted   
Subject Only to Income Inclusion:  
      (1) Repeal of tax on employer reversions: Section 4980 of   
    such Code is hereby repealed.  
      (2) Employer reversions permitted without plan termination:  
    Section 420 of such Code is amended to read as follows:  
`SEC. 420. TRANSFERS OF EXCESS PENSION ASSETS.  
  `(a) In General: If there is a qualified transfer of any excess  
pension assets of a defined benefit plan (other than a   
multiemployer plan) to an employer--  
      `(1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated  
    as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a) or any  
    other provision of law solely by reason of such transfer (or   
    any other action authorized under this section), and  
      `(2) such transfer shall not be treated as a prohibited  
    transaction for purposes of section 4975.  
The gross income of the employer shall include the amount of any  
qualified transfer made during the taxable year.  
  `(b) Qualified Transfer: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) In general: The term `qualified transfer' means a  
    transfer--  
          `(A) of excess pension assets of a defined benefit plan   
        to the employer, and  
          `(B) with respect to which the vesting requirements of  
        subsection (c) are met in connection with the plan.  
      `(2) Only 1 transfer per year: No more than 1 transfer with  
    respect to any plan during a taxable year may be treated as a  
    qualified transfer for purposes of this section.  
  `(c) Vesting Requirements of Plans Transferring Assets: The  
vesting requirements of this subsection are met if the plan   
provides that the accrued pension benefits of any participant or  
beneficiary under the plan become nonforfeitable in the same manner  
which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately  
before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who  
separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the  
transfer, immediately before such separation).  
  `(d) Definition and Special Rule: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) Excess pension assets: The term `excess pension assets'  
    means the excess (if any) of--  
          `(A) the amount determined under section   
        412(c)(7)(A)(ii), over  
          `(B) the greater of--  
              `(i) the amount determined under section  
            412(c)(7)(A)(i), or  
              `(ii) 125 percent of current liability (as defined in  
            section 412(c)(7)(B)).  
    The determination under this paragraph shall be made as of the  
    most recent valuation date of the plan preceding the qualified  
    transfer.  
      `(2) Coordination with section 412: In the case of a   
    qualified transfer--  
          `(A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before  
        the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable  
        thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as  
        assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year,  
        and  
          `(B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience  
        loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to  
        the amount of such transfer and for which amortization  
        charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year   
        in which such transfer occurs, except that such section  
        shall be applied to such amount by substituting `10 plan  
        years' for `5 plan years'.'

<font size=5><b>FREEDOM &amp; FAIRNESS RESTORATION ACT<br> 
OF 1995 (Flat Tax) - Summary <br> </font>
<font size=4>H.R. 2060, S. 1050<br></b></font>
<hr>   
(This analysis  is an excerpt from &quotA Side By Side Analysis   
of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot; 
published  August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)   
   <br>
<hr>
</center>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Armey and Mr. Shelby<br>   
   <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The plan is based on the principles set   
forth in &quot;The Flat Tax&quot; by Robert E. Hall and   
Alvin Rabushka (2nd Ed., 1995).  The plan has an individual   
wage tax and a business tax imposed on all   
forms of business which allows the deduction of &quot;business   
inputs&quot; but not taxes, fringe benefits, interest and dividends.   
   <p>
Unlike a value added tax, wages are deductible to the firm   
and the employee is taxed on his wages (after a   
generous standard deduction and dependent exemption).  The   
proposal would have a comprehensive   
consumption tax base.   
   <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals:</b>  20 percent flat tax rate for   
1996, 17 percent thereafter on wages.   
   <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  Individual taxable income is defined   
as wages, retirement distributions and   
unemployment compensation less the standard deduction and   
the dependent exemptions.   
   <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense: 
</b>
Investment income is neither taxable   
to the recipient nor deductible to the payor.   
   <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b> Municipal bond interest would not   
be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance: </b> The standard   
deduction would be:   
   <p>
$21,400 for a joint return or surviving spouse;   <br>
$14,000 for a head of household;   <br>
$10,700 for a single person or married couple filing   
separately.   <br>
   <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b> None.   
   <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b> $5,000 per dependent.   
   <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Not taxed on financial instruments.  Gross   
proceeds from real and personal property are   
included in income.  Basis existing prior to enactment of   
the flat tax is not deductible against gross   
revenue from the sale of property.   
   <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is   
repealed.  Capital gains from the sale of a   
home would not be taxed.   
   <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes:</b>  State and local taxes are not   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is   
repealed.   
   <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs, and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  Receipts from   
qualified plans by individuals would generally be taxable.   
   <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries): </b> Wages would be taxable to   
the employee and deductible to the business.   
   <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable contributions would   
not be deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Educational Expenses:</b>  Educational expenses would not be   
deductible.   
   <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would not be   
taxed.   
   <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing: </b> The dependent exemption and standard   
deduction are indexed for inflation.   
   <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are   
exempt.

                   IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. OBEY (for himself, Mr. HINCHEY, Mr. BRYANT of Texas, and Ms. 
    PELOSI) introduced the following bill; which was referred to  
    the Committee on Ways and Means 
                               A BILL 
To provide for a tax reduction in the case of low economic growth. 
 [Italic->]   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress 
assembled, [<-Italic] 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
  This Act may be cited as the `Tax Reduction and Economic Growth 
Act of 1995'. 
SEC. 2. TAX REDUCTION IN THE EVENT OF LOW GROWTH. 
  (a) LOW-GROWTH REPORT-  
      (1) IN GENERAL- At any time, the Director of the Office of 
    Management and Budget (hereafter in this section referred to as 
    the `Director') shall notify the President and the Congress if 
    the Director has determined that for any of the periods 
    described in paragraph (2)-- 
          (A) economic growth as measured by the change in real 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at an annual rate is estimated 
        to be less than 1.5 percent, and 
          (B) the rate of national unemployment (seasonally 
        adjusted) is estimated to be greater than 6.5 percent. 
      (2) TESTING PERIODS- For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
    periods described in this paragraph are-- 
          (A) the period consisting of the quarter during which the 
        notification is given and the quarter preceding such 
        notification, 
          (B) the period consisting of the preceding 4 quarters, and 
          (C) the period consisting of the 2 quarters following  
        such notification. 
  (b) PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORIZATION OF TEMPORARY TAX REDUCTIONS-  
      (1) PRESIDENTIAL DECLARATION- After notification under 
    subsection (a), the President may issue a declaration that 
    temporary income tax reductions are required for a specified 
    calendar year to provide a quick and necessary fiscal stimulus 
    to the economy. Any such declaration shall be transmitted to  
    the Congress. 
      (2) TEMPORARY TAX MODIFICATIONS- If the President transmits a 
    declaration under paragraph (1) to the Congress-- 
          (A) TEMPORARY TAX REDUCTIONS-  
              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the calendar year specified in such declaration-- 
  (I) the rates applicable to the first income bracket in the tax 
tables contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall be reduced by a percentage (not to exceed 3 percent)  
specified in such declaration, and 
  (II) the amounts set fourth as tax in such tables shall be 
adjusted to reflect such rate reduction. 
              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- The withholding tables 
            or procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the 
            Treasury or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such 
Code shall be modified so that, to the maximum extent possible, the 
full calendar year effect of such reduction is reflected through 
withholding reductions during the portion of the calendar year  
after such declaration. 
          (B) Temporary surtax where economic growth requirements 
        subsequently satisfied- 
              (i) IN GENERAL- Effective for taxable years beginning 
            in the first subsequent calendar year for which the 
            economic growth requirements of paragraph (3) are 
            satisfied-- 
  (I) each rate of tax in the tax tables contained in section 1 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be increased by the 
percentage determined under paragraph (4) for such year, except the 
tax rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than 
$50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income of 
less than $75,000 shall not exceed the rates established in the  
year prior to the temporary tax reduction, and 
  (II) the amounts set forth as tax in such tables shall be  
adjusted to reflect such rate increases. 
              (ii) WITHHOLDING ADJUSTMENTS- Effective for such 
            subsequent calendar year, the withholding tables or 
            procedures prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury 
            or his delegate under section 3402(a) of such Code  
            shall be modified to reflect the increase in tax rates 
            under clause (i). 
      (3) ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIREMENTS- The economic growth 
    requirements of this paragraph are satisfied for any calendar 
    year if, before the beginning of such calendar year, the 
    President determines (and publishes such determination in the 
    Federal Register) that for such calendar year and the 
    immediately preceding calendar year-- 
          (A) economic growth as measured by the change in the real 
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to be greater  
        than 4.5 percent, and 
          (B) the rate of national unemployment (seasonally 
        adjusted) is estimated to be less than 5.5 percent. 
      (4) RATE INCREASE PERCENTAGE- The percentage determined under 
    this paragraph is the percentage increase in the tax rates 
    contained in section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
    which the President estimates will result in an aggregate 
    increase in receipts under chapter 1 of such Code equal to the 
    aggregate decrease in receipts under such Code by reason of 
    subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) without increasing the tax 
    rate for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income of less than 
    $50,000 and taxpayers filing jointly with Adjusted Gross Income 
    of less than $75,000 above the rates established in the year 
    prior to the temporary tax reduction. Such percentage shall be 
    published in the Federal Register before the beginning of the 
    calendar year for which the economic requirements of paragraph 
    (2) are satisfied. 
SEC. 3. TREATMENT UNDER PAY-AS-YOU-GO PROCEDURES. 
  Any reduction or increase in receipts resulting from section 2 of 
this Act shall not be considered for any purpose under the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

    subsection) shall be increased by the sum of-- 
          `(A) such excess, plus 
          `(B) the product of such excess and the 3-month Treasury

    period selected by the Secretary and ending in the calendar 
    month in which the determination is made) on outstanding

    periods to maturity of 3 months or less.'

                  STATES. 
  (a) Findings: The Congress finds that-- 
      (1) to provide for the prosperity of future generations, the 
    United States must achieve higher levels of saving and 
    investment, which will in turn increase productivity, economic 
    growth, and living standards; 
      (2) the Tax Code is an important element of our national 
    saving policy; 
      (3) the current Tax Code is irreparably flawed and should be 
    replaced with a new progressive system  which promotes saving 
    and investment, and thus more rapid economic growth, while 
    ensuring fairness through progressive taxation; 
      (4) all individuals at all income levels should be given a 
    fair opportunity to save, invest, and raise their standard of 
    living and that of their children; 
      (5) future economic growth requires a tax system that 
    facilitates successful competition in the global marketplace; 
      (6) the tax system of the United States must be as simple and 
    efficient as possible; and 
      (7) to ensure that national saving is increased, reform of  
    the tax system must not increase the Federal budget deficit. 
  (b) Main Features of USA Tax System:  
      (1) Replacement of old tax system: Chapter 1 of subtitle A 
    (related to income taxes) of the Code is repealed and replaced 
    for years beginning after 1995. 
      (2) New tax system: The USA Tax consists of-- 
          (A) a simplified tax collected from individuals, that for 
        years after 1995 replaces the income tax imposed on 
        individuals by section 1 of the Code, and 
          (B) a simplified tax collected from corporations and  
        other businesses, that for years after 1995 replaces the 
        income tax imposed on corporations by section 11 of the Code. 
      (3) USA tax on gross profits: Corporations and other 
    businesses pay tax on their annual gross profits from business 
    conducted in the United States, except that-- 
          (A) export revenues are excluded, and 
          (B) imports are taxed. 
      (4) USA tax on income: Individuals pay tax on their annual 
    income from wages, dividends, interest, and other financial 
    income (including sales of property), except that-- 
          (A) tax is deferred on income the consumption of which is 
        deferred and added to the national stock of savings, 
          (B) a portion of each family's income is exempt from tax, 
        and 
          (C) deductions are allowed for-- 
              (i) education costs, 
              (ii) religious, charitable, and other philanthropic 
            donations, and 
              (iii) home mortgage interest payments. 
      (5) Credit for fica payroll taxes paid: The amount of tax due 
    is reduced by the payroll tax that is-- 
          (A) in the case of an employee, withheld from wages, or 
          (B) in the case of a corporation or other business, paid 
        by the employer. 
  (c) Concepts and Structure of New Tax System:  
      (1) Guiding principles of the usa tax system: The USA Tax is 
    based on the following principles: 
          (A) National wealth and well-being depend on the work, 
        skill, and savings and investment of people. 
          (B) Businesses are people and their capital working 
        together. 
          (C) Capital makes people more productive. 
          (D) Everyone benefits from a growing stock of national 
        savings which in turn allows for a growing stock of  
        physical and human capital. 
          (E) Under the USA Tax, the deferral of taxation on 
        investments in physical and human capital represents an 
        investment by the Federal Government in the Nation's  
        capital stock and the Federal Government shares in the 
        return on its investment in the form of higher economic 
        output and revenues in the future. 
      (2) Single tax in 2 parts: The USA Tax is composed of a 
    business tax and an individual tax which are 2 parts of a  
    single tax system that subjects all income produced and  
    received to taxation once and only once. The 2 parts are as 
    follows: 
          (A) Business tax at the source of income: Tax is paid by 
        corporations and other businesses which produce and sell 
        goods and services that are-- 
              (i) the source of nearly all the gross domestic 
            product of the United States, and 
              (ii) the ultimate source of income received by 
            individuals. 
          (B) Individual tax on income received: Tax is paid by 
        individuals-- 
              (i) when they receive wages and salaries as 
            compensation for gross domestic product created by  
            their work, and 
              (ii) when they receive interest, dividends, and other 
            financial income as compensation for gross domestic 
            product created by their savings and investment. 
      (3) Saving and investment: The USA Tax allows people to save 
    and businesses to invest as follows: 
          (A) Fair opportunity for people to save:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a person defers  
            receipt of income by adding it to the national stock of 
            savings-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the amount saved, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Withdrawal of savings and earnings: When 
            withdrawn from savings, both the principal amount saved 
            and the earnings on savings are included in gross  
            income subject to tax. 
              (iii) Analogy to individual retirement accounts: The 
            deduction for saving is the equivalent of allowing a 
            deduction for the contribution a person makes to an 
            individual retirement account (IRA), except that-- 
  (I) savers have greater control and flexibility, 
  (II) no specially designated account is required, 
  (III) savings are not limited to retirement purposes, 
  (IV) the deduction for saving is unlimited in amount, and 
  (V) savings can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. 
          (B) Fair opportunity for businesses to invest:  
              (i) No prepayment of tax: When a business invests in 
            plant and equipment-- 
  (I) a deduction is allowed for the cost, and 
  (II) tax is deferred. 
              (ii) Tax on earnings and recovery of cost: When 
            recovered out of business revenues, both the cost of  
            the investment and the earnings on the investment are 
            included in gross profit subject to tax. 
              (iii) Expensing: The deduction for investment is the 
            equivalent of allowing the cost of plant and equipment 
            to be expensed instead of depreciated. 
      (4) Fair opportunity to compete in the global marketplace:  
    The USA Tax serves the strategic interests of the United States 
    in international markets as follows: 
          (A) Border adjustable tax:  
              (i) American-made exports: Goods and services  
            produced in the United States can be sold into world 
            markets free of tax. 
              (ii) Foreign-made imports: Goods and services  
            imported into the United States bear a fair and 
            proportionate share of the tax burden in the United 
            States. 
              (iii) Leveling the international playing field:  
            Border adjustments for exports and imports are 
            consistent with international standards and practice. 
      (5) Simpler and more understandable tax: Compared to the 
    income tax it replaces, the USA Tax for individuals-- 
          (A) is written in a simpler, more understandable form, and 
          (B) contains only a few exemptions, deductions, and 
        credits. 
      (6) USA tax is revenue neutral: The USA Tax is designed to 
    neither increase nor decrease the total amount of tax paid and 
    collected under the current Code. 
      (7) Maintaining tax progressivity for individuals:  
          (A) Graduated tax: Like the tax imposed by section 1 of 
        the current Code, the USA Tax for individuals is a  
        graduated tax. 
          (B) Family living allowance: The USA Tax recognizes that 
        every family's budget includes necessities. The USA Tax 
        provides a family living allowance that exempts from 
        taxation the first dollars earned and spent to maintain a 
        basic standard of living. 
          (C) Individual tax burden by income level: The tax burden 
        across income classes ranging from low income to high  
        income is about the same as under the current Code. 
      (8) Business and individual portions of tax burden:  
          (A) Business portion of tax burden: Corporations and  
        other businesses pay about the same portion of the total  
        tax as under the current Code. 
          (B) Individual portion of tax burden: Individuals pay 
        about the same portion of the total tax as under the  
        current Code. 
      (9) Emphasizing personal independence and responsibility:  
          (A) Reinforcing a culture of work and thrift: Instead of 
        being solely a calculation of how much they must pay to the 
        government, the USA Tax converts the income tax into an 
        annual calculation of-- 
              (i) how much people produce and contribute to the 
            economy, 
              (ii) how much they take out of the economy, and 
              (iii) how much they save and put back into the  
            economy for their own and the nation's future. 
          (B) Greater control and responsibility: Because people  
        are allowed to defer tax on income through saving, they 
        have-- 
              (i) more control over their own income and taxes, 
              (ii) a greater ability to plan and provide for their 
            own future, and 
              (iii) a fair opportunity to do so. 
      (10) More opportunity for wage earners at lower income levels:  
          (A) Refundable credit for employee payroll tax: The  
        amount of the payroll tax paid or withheld under the Code 
        from an employee's wages (and paid into the Social Security 
        and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds) is-- 
              (i) credited against the employee's income tax, and 
              (ii) refunded to the employee to the extent in excess 
            of the employee's income tax. 
          (B) Refundable income tax credit for the working poor:  
        The USA Tax-- 
              (i) increases the credit allowed by section 32 of the 
            current Code, and 
              (ii) concentrates the credit on families with children. 
          (C) No effect on trust fund or benefits: The income tax 
        credit allowed for payroll taxes deposited in the Social 
        Security Trust Fund does not-- 
              (i) reduce the amount in such fund, or 
              (ii) reduce the payment of any person's benefits from 
            the fund.

sale acquires 1 or more savings assets, the taxpayer may elect to-- 
      `(1) roll over its basis from the asset sold to the asset 
    purchased, 
      `(2) not treat so much of the proceeds of the sale of the 
    savings asset as equals the cost of new savings assets as a 
    withdrawal, and 
      `(3) not treat so much of the cost of the new savings asset  
    as equals the proceeds of the sale of the old savings asset as 
    new savings. 
Such election shall be made on the tax return for the taxable year 
of the sale of the old asset. 
  `(c) Rules for Gratuitous Transfers:  
      `(1) No withdrawal for donor: If a donor transfers a savings 
    asset other than cash (or a bank account or other similar 
    account with a balance denominated in cash) to a donee, whether 
    during the donor's life or by reason of the donor's death, the 
    donor shall not be treated as withdrawing the amount so 
    transferred. 
      `(2) Anti-abuse rule: Under regulations to be prescribed by 
    the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any inter vivos 
    transfer if the transfer is made primarily to effect a transfer 
    of tax liability to a taxpayer in a lower tax bracket. The 
    Secretary may presume that a transfer was made primarily to 
    effect a transfer of tax liability if the savings asset (or any 
    savings asset acquired with the proceeds of such asset) is  
    sold, disposed of, or withdrawn within the 3-year period 
    following the transfer and the proceeds are used to pay  
    expenses that the transferor is likely to have paid but for the 
    transfer. 
      `(3) Transfer of cash or bank account: If a donor transfers 
    cash (or a bank account or other similar account with a balance 
    denominated in cash) to a donee, the donor will be treated as 
    having withdrawn the amount so transferred. The donee will be 
    treated as making an addition to savings to the extent that the 
    donee makes an addition to savings with cash or maintains the 
    account so transferred. 
`SEC. 57. GENERAL BASIS ACCOUNT. 
  `(a) Explanation: The general basis account is intended to allow 
he taxpayer to withdraw from savings an amount of savings equal to 
he amount which had previously been included in income because the 
amount was saved before the Unlimited Savings Allowance became 
applicable or because no savings deduction was allowed because the 
savings was treated as made with borrowed funds, tax-exempt income, 
or from withdrawals of previously taxed savings. 
  `(b) In General: Each taxpayer shall have a general basis  
account, which shall start with a balance of zero, which balance 
shall-- 
      `(1) in the case of a taxpayer with net savings in a taxable 
    year, be increased as of the end of the taxable year by the 
    lesser of-- 
          `(A) the taxpayer's net savings for the taxable year; or 
          `(B) nontaxable sources of funds (as defined in section 
        52(a)(2)(B)), 
      `(2) in the case of a taxpayer with net withdrawals for the 
    taxable year, decreased as of the end of the taxable year, but 
    not below zero, by the amount of net withdrawals, 
      `(3) in the case of the sale of a savings asset by a taxpayer 
    for an amount less than its basis, increased by the amount by 
    which the basis exceeds the proceeds of the sale, and 
      `(4) be increased as provided in subsections (c) and (d). 
  `(c) Special Rules To Ensure Benefit of Savings Deduction Upon 
Sale of Principal Residence: 
      `(1) Explanation: If a taxpayer who is planning to retire or 
    acquire a smaller principal residence sells a principal 
    residence in which the taxpayer has a significant basis and  
    then saves most of the proceeds of the sale, the taxpayer may 
    not have sufficient income in the year to fully absorb the 
    savings deduction attributable to the new savings. This 
    provision allows the taxpayer to use the portion of the savings 
    deduction that would otherwise not be used to reduce future 
    deferred income. 
      `(2) Rule: A taxpayer who sells his principal residence in a 
    taxable year may increase his general basis account by the 
    portion of the saved basis of the principal residence that the 
    taxpayer determines that he cannot use in the taxable year. In 
    his tax return for the year of the sale, the taxpayer shall 
    elect what portion of the saved basis to treat as savings in 
    determining his Unlimited Savings Allowance 
and what portion to add to his general basis account as of the end 
of that year. Once a return is filed in which an election is made, 
he election shall be irrevocable for that taxable year (except if 
he amount of saved basis is reduced by a subsequent purchase of a 
replacement principal residence). 
      `(3) Saved basis: The `saved basis' from the sale of a 
    taxpayer's principal residence shall equal the least of-- 
          `(A) the Unlimited Savings Allowance determined in 
        accordance with section 50 (but without regard to this 
        subsection) for the taxable year of the sale of the 
        taxpayer's principal residence, 
          `(B) the net proceeds from the sale of the residence 
        (including any proceeds applied to pay off indebtedness but 
        excluding proceeds that were applied to pay transactional 
        costs, such as brokerage fees and transfer taxes), or 
          `(C) the excess of the taxpayer's basis in the principal 
        residence over the taxpayer's basis in any new principal 
        residence to which the residence rollover rule of section  
        76 applies. 
  `(d) Election To Increase General Basis Account by Bank Account 
Balance: A taxpayer may elect to increase his general basis account 
by the balance in his bank accounts as of January 1, 1996. Such 
election shall be made on the taxpayer's return for the period 
covering such date. If the election is made, the taxpayer shall  
have no basis in his bank accounts. 
  `(e) Other Adjustments: See section 56(a)(2)(D) (relating to bank 
accounts and brokerage accounts that are terminated with basis) and 
section 78, relating to losses. 
`SEC. 58. ANTI-ABUSE RULES. 
  `(a) Borrowing To Generate Deduction:  
      `(1) General rule: A taxpayer shall not be permitted to treat 
    as a savings asset (and the Secretary shall have authority to 
    deny such treatment if claimed by the taxpayer) if such savings 
    asset was acquired with funds borrowed for the purpose of 
    increasing the taxpayer's Unlimited Savings Allowance or 
    decreasing the taxpayer's deferred income. 
      `(2) Ordering: Subsection (a) shall be applied after the net 
    savings calculation in section 50 and shall apply only to the 
    extent that that section does not itself deny the taxpayer a 
    benefit from the borrowing. 
      `(3) Exempt borrowing: Subsection (a) shall apply to any 
    exempt borrowing to the extent that the borrowing is directly 
    traceable to the acquisition of a savings asset or such 
    borrowing is transitory. 
  `(b) Conversion to Cash: Any cash in excess of $250 held by a 
axpayer on January 1, 1996, shall be treated as a savings asset.  
If such cash is used to acquire a savings asset, it will be treated 
as withdrawn and then used to acquire a savings asset, so that no 
net deduction arises. 
  `(c) Borrowing in Lieu of Withdrawing: If the Secretary  
determines that because of the Unlimited Savings Allowance and 
deferred income rules, taxpayers are borrowing against their  
savings to consume rather than withdrawing their savings, the 
Secretary shall have authority to prescribe rules that treat 
indebtedness that is secured by interests in savings assets as 
amounts withdrawn. 
   `SUBCHAPTER C--BASIS, BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND NONRECOGNITION 
                            TRANSACTIONS 
`SEC. 71. EFFECT OF BASIS. 
  `(a) In General: The amount of gross income to be recognized on 
he sale or exchange of property equals the excess of-- 
      `(1) the net proceeds from the sale, over 
      `(2) the taxpayer's adjusted basis, if any, in the property. 
  `(b) Nonrecognition Transaction: Subsection (a) shall not apply  
o nonrecognition transactions described in this chapter. 
  `(c) Savings Assets: Subchapter B generally governs the treatment 
of the basis of savings assets. 
`SEC. 72. BASIS. 
  `(a) Basis, Sale, or Exchange: Except to the extent inconsistent 
with provisions of this chapter, adjusted basis and the existence  
of a sale or exchange shall be determined in accordance with 
principles applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(b) Definition of Basis: For purposes of this chapter, `basis' 
means the adjusted basis of property. The adjusted basis of  
property is generally its cost, as adjusted for actions or 
transactions that increase or decrease the basis of property.  
Except as provided in section 12 (relating to the 3-year 
amortization of basis in savings assets) and section 73 (relating  
o business entities and basis in business entities), the  
axpayer's adjusted basis on January 1, 1996, in an asset acquired 
before that date, shall be its adjusted basis as of December 31, 
1995, as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
  `(c) Effect of Treating Asset Purchase as Savings: If the  
purchase of a savings asset is treated in whole or part as an 
addition to savings, the taxpayer shall have no basis in the amount 
so treated. 
`SEC. 73. BASIS IN BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Partnership Interest:  
      `(1) Initial basis in old partnerships: A partner's basis in  
    a partnership interest as of January 1, 1996, equals-- 
          `(A) the partner's basis in the partnership as of the end 
        of the taxable year ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the amount of the partner's share of the  
        indebtedness of the partnership taken into account in 
        determining such basis. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the taxpayer has a negative basis in the 
    partnership and such negative basis shall increase the gain on 
    the sale or disposition of the partnership interest (except to 
    the extent such negative basis is taken into account in 
    determining the transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A partner shall have no basis in a 
        partnership formed on or after January 1, 1996, and shall 
        not adjust his basis in any partnership interest after such 
        date by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the partnership, 
              `(ii) distribution from the partnership, or 
              `(iii) any change in the partner's share of the 
            partnership's indebtedness. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A partner shall have basis or an  
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), or 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            partnership (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Partnership: For purposes of this subsection, 
    `partnership' includes a corporation that was treated as an S 
    corporation under such Code. 
  `(b) Proprietorship:  
      `(1) Old proprietorship: A proprietor's basis in any business 
    activity conducted before January 1, 1996, which is treated as  
    a business activity as of such date equals-- 
          `(A) the proprietor's adjusted basis in the assets of  
        such business entity as of the end of the taxable year 
        ending on December 31, 1995, minus 
          `(B) the balance of any indebtedness the interest on  
        which the proprietor had treated as business interest under 
        section 163(h)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
      `(2) Negative basis: If the amount determined under paragraph 
    (1) is negative, the proprietor has a negative basis in the 
    proprietorship and such negative basis shall increase the gain 
    on the sale or disposition of the entity (except to the extent 
    such negative basis is taken into account in determining the 
    transition basis deduction). 
      `(3) Adjustment to basis:  
          `(A) In general: A taxpayer shall have no basis in a 
        business entity (as defined in section 151) formed on or 
        after January 1, 1996, and shall not adjust his basis in  
        any such entity by reason of any-- 
              `(i) contribution to the business entity, or 
              `(ii) distribution from the business entity. 
          `(B) Exceptions: A proprietor shall have basis or an 
        addition to basis resulting from-- 
              `(i) contributions of cash or land to a land company 
            (as provided in section 114), 
              `(ii) a contribution of personal-use property to a 
            business entity (as provided in section 111). 
      `(4) Proprietorship: `Proprietorship' includes-- 
          `(A) any family business that is not a partnership, and 
          `(B) any business activity conducted by a taxpayer other 
        than as an employee if such activity constitutes a business 
        entity. 
  `(c) Anti-Avoidance Rule: If partnership distributions to an 
individual partner in its taxable year or taxable years ending in 
1995 exceeds the partner's distributive share of income for such 
period, the amount of such excess distribution shall be treated as  
a cash distribution to the partner on January 1, 1996, and shall  
not reduce the partner's basis in his partnership interest. 
`SEC. 74. GRATUITOUS TRANSFERS. 
  `(a) In General: If after December 31, 1995, a taxpayer receives  
a savings asset or any other property by gift, inheritance, or  
other gratuitous transfer, the taxpayer's basis in the property 
shall be the lesser of-- 
      `(1) the fair market value of the property at the time of 
    transfer, or 
      `(2) the transferee's basis in the property at the time of 
    transfer. 
  `(b) Proof Required: A taxpayer's basis in a savings asset 
received by gift, inheritance, or other gratuitous transfer shall  
be presumed to be zero unless the taxpayer can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary the basis claimed by the taxpayer. 
`SEC. 75. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING BUSINESS ENTITIES. 
  `(a) Cash Capital Contributions, Business Interests Acquired:  
      `(1) A taxpayer shall have no basis by reason of cash 
    contributed to the capital of a business on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 114 (relating to land 
    companies). A contribution of property acquired for purposes of 
    contribution shall be treated as a contribution of cash equal  
    to the amount of property contributed. 
      `(2) A taxpayer shall have no basis in stock or other  
    interest in a business entity purchased on or after January 1, 
    1996, except as provided in section 77 (relating to certain 
    exchanges) or in the case of an acquisition of a land company. 
  `(b) Contributions of Property:  
      `(1) In general: If a taxpayer contributes personal-use 
    property to a business entity the taxpayer's basis in his 
    interest in the entity will increase by the lesser of-- 
          `(A) the fair market value of the property contributed, or 
          `(B) the basis of the property contributed. 
      `(2) Personal-use property: `Personal-use property' shall  
    have the meaning given to it in section 111(c). 
      `(3) No loss: A taxpayer may not increase his general basis 
    account by the amount of any `loss' attributable to basis 
    obtained through the contribution of personal-use property. 
  `(c) Basis in Business Divisions: In the case of a spinoff, 
split-off, or split-up of a business entity in which a taxpayer has 
basis, the taxpayer's basis in the original business entity shall  
be allocated among the new and surviving entities in accordance  
with the relative fair market values of the taxpayer's interests in 
hose entities. If interests in the entities are publicly traded, 
air market values shall be based on public trading prices. In  
other cases, the Secretary shall accept any reasonable allocation 
made by the taxpayer if the taxpayer notifies the Secretary of the 
allocation in an attachment to its tax return for the taxable year 
of the transaction. 
  `(d) Distributions:  
      `(1) In general: In the case of any distribution of property 
    by a business entity to a taxpayer, the taxpayer shall have a 
    withdrawal equal to the amount of-- 
          `(A) cash received, and 
          `(B) the fair market value of property received and not 
        converted to business use. 
      `(2) Savings assets received: The taxpayer may not treat as  
    an addition to savings any savings asset received from a 
    business entity in a distribution or any business property 
    received and contributed to another business entity. 
      `(3) Effect of basis:  
          `(A) Distributions other than in complete liquidation: 
        Except as provided in paragraph (4), in the case of a 
        dividend or other distribution (including any distribution 
        that would be treated as a return of capital under general 
        business law principles or the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986) by a business entity, a taxpayer's basis in such 
        entity shall not be applied to any amounts or property 
        received in the distribution. 
          `(B) Complete liquidation: In the case of a distribution 
        in complete liquidation of a business entity, a taxpayer's 
        basis in the entity shall be allocated among the cash, 
        savings assets, and property received in the liquidation. 
        Basis allocated to amounts treated as withdrawn shall be 
        applied in determining the amount of the taxable withdrawal. 
      `(4) Distribution of personal-use property: In the case of  
    the distribution of personal-use property by a business entity 
    to the taxpayer who contributed such property to the business 
    entity on or after January 1, 1996, the taxpayer's basis in  
    such property shall equal the lesser of the taxpayer's basis in 
    the property at the time of contribution or the taxpayer's  
    basis in the business entity. Upon the distribution, the 
    taxpayer's basis in the business entity shall be reduced by the 
    basis allocated to the distributed personal-use property. 
`SEC. 76. ROLLOVER ON RESIDENCE SALE. 
  `(a) Nonrecognition of Gain: If property (in this section called 
`old residence') used by the taxpayer as his principal residence is 
sold by him and, within a period beginning 2 years before the date 
of such sale and ending 2 years after such date, property (in this 
section called `new residence') is purchased and used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, gain (if any) from such sale 
shall be recognized only to the extent that the taxpayer's adjusted 
sales price (as defined in subsection (b)) of the old residence 
exceeds the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence. 
  `(b) Adjusted Sales Price Defined:  
      `(1) In general: For purposes of this section, the `adjusted 
    sales price' means the amount realized, reduced by the  
    aggregate of the expenses for work performed on the old 
    residence in order to assist in its sale. 
      `(2) Limitations: The reduction provided in paragraph (1) 
    applies only to expenses-- 
          `(A) for work performed during the 90-day period ending  
        on the day on which the contract to sell the old residence 
        is entered into; 
          `(B) which are paid on or before the 30th day after the 
        date of the sale of the old residence; and 
          `(C) which are-- 
              `(i) not allowable as deductions in computing taxable 
            income, and 
              `(ii) not taken into account in computing the amount 
            realized from the sale of the old residence. 
  `(c) Rules for Application of Section: For purposes of this 
section: 
      `(1) An exchange by the taxpayer of his residence for other 
    property shall be treated as a sale of such residence, and the 
    acquisition of a residence on the exchange of property shall be 
    treated as a purchase of such residence. 
      `(2) A residence any part of which was constructed or 
    reconstructed by the taxpayer shall be treated as purchased by 
    the taxpayer. In determining the taxpayer's cost of purchasing  
    a residence, there shall be included only so much of his cost  
    as is attributable to the acquisition, construction, 
    reconstruction, and improvements made which are properly 
    chargeable to capital account, during the period specified in 
    subsection (a). 
      `(3) If a residence is purchased by the taxpayer before the 
    date of his sale of the old residence, the purchased residence 
    shall not be treated as his new residence if sold or otherwise 
    disposed of by him before the date of the sale of the old 
    residence. 
      `(4) If the taxpayer, during the period described in 
    subsection (a), purchases more than 1 residence which is used  
    by him as his principal residence at some time within 2 years 
    after the date of the sale of the old residence, only the last 
    of such residences so used by him after the date of such sale 
    shall constitute the new residence. If a principal residence is 
    sold in a sale to which subsection (d)(2) applies within 2  
    years after the sale of the old residence, for purposes of 
    applying the preceding sentence with respect to the old 
    residence, the principal residence so sold shall be treated as 
    the last residence used during such 2-year period. 
  `(d) Limitation:  
      `(1) In general: Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect 
    to the sale of the taxpayer's residence if within 2 years  
    before the date of such sale the taxpayer sold at a gain other 
    property used by him as his principal residence, and any part  
    of such gain was not recognized by reason of subsection (a). 
      `(2) Subsequent sale connected with commencing work at new 
    place: Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the sale  
    of the taxpayer's residence if such sale was in connection with 
    the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a 
    self-employed individual at a new principal place of work. 
  `(e) Basis of New Residence: Where the purchase of a new  
residence results, under subsection (a), in the nonrecognition of 
gain on the sale of an old residence, in determining the adjusted 
basis of the new residence as of any time following the sale of the 
old residence, the adjustments to basis shall include a reduction  
by an amount equal to the amount of the gain not so recognized on 
he sale of the old residence. For this purpose, the amount of the 
gain not so recognized on the sale of the old residence includes 
only so much of such gain as is not recognized by reason of the 
cost, up to such time, of purchasing the new residence. 
  `(f) Tenant-Stockholder in a Cooperative Housing Corporation: For 
purposes of this chapter, references to property used by the 
axpayer as his principal residence, and references to the  
residence of a taxpayer, shall include stock held by a 
enant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation if-- 
      `(1) in the case of stock sold, the house or apartment which 
    the taxpayer was entitled to occupy 
as such stockholder was used by him as his principal residence, and 
      `(2) in the case of stock purchased, the taxpayer used as his 
    principal residence the house or apartment which he was  
    entitled to occupy as such stockholder. 
  `(g) Husband and Wife: If the taxpayer and his spouse, in 
accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the 
Secretary pursuant to this subsection, consent to the application  
of paragraph (2) of this subsection, then-- 
      `(1) for purposes of this section-- 
          `(A) the taxpayer's adjusted sales price of the old 
        residence is the adjusted sales price (of the taxpayer, or 
        of the taxpayer and his spouse) of the old residence, and 
          `(B) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the new residence 
        is the cost (to the taxpayer, his spouse, or both) of 
        purchasing the new residence (whether held by the taxpayer, 
        his spouse, or the taxpayer and his spouse); and 
      `(2) so much of the gain on the sale of the old residence as 
    is not recognized solely by reason of this subsection, and so 
    much of the adjustment under subsection (e) to the basis of the 
    new residence as results solely from this subsection shall be 
    allocated between the taxpayer and his spouse as provided in 
    such regulations. 
This subsection shall apply only if the old residence and the new 
residence are each used by the taxpayer and his spouse as their 
principal residence. In case the taxpayer and his spouse do not 
consent to the application of paragraph (2) of this subsection,  
hen the recognition of gain on the sale of the old residence shall 
be determined under this section without regard to the rules 
provided in this subsection. For purposes of this subsection,  
except to the extent provided in regulations, in the case of an 
individual who dies after the date of the sale of the old residence 
and is married on the date of death, consent to the application of 
paragraph (2) by such individual's spouse and use of the new 
residence as the principal residence of such spouse shall be  
treated as consent and use by such individual. 
  `(h) Members of Armed Forces:  
      `(1) In general: The running of any period of time specified

USA TAX - Summary<br></font>
<font size=4>S.722<br>

<hr>
(This analysis is an excerpt from &quot;A Side By Side Analysis Of Alternative Tax System Proposals&quot;  
published August 1, 1995 by <a href="/savers/legislation/blc.html">The Business 
Leadership Council</a>.)  
  </center>
<hr>
<b>Sponsors:</b> Mr. Domenici and Mr. Nunn  
  <p>
<b>Basic Principles:</b>  The bill imposes a steeply graduated consumed 
income tax on individuals.  It imposes   
a subtraction method value added tax on business.  The proposal would have a fairly comprehensive   
consumption tax base but would retain a reduced mortgage interest deduction, a charitable deduction and   
enact a deduction for higher educational expenses.  The proposal would provide a credit to employers and   
employees for FICA taxes paid and an earned income tax credit.  The proposal would have a consumption   
tax base, but the exceptions are significant.  
  <p>
<b>Rate Structure, Individuals: </b> Different tax tables apply for each of 
the years 1996 to 1999, inclusive.  For all years, the top rate is 40 
percent of taxable income.  The 1996 tax tables are: <br> 
  <p>
For married filing jointly and surviving spouses:  <br>
<p>  
$0-$5,399 :     19%  <br>
$5,400 to $24,000 :    $1,026 plus 27%  <br>
Over $24,000 :           $6,048 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For heads of household:  
 <p> 
$0-$4,749 :    19%  <br>
$4,750 to $21,100 :   $903 plus 27%  <br>
Over $21,100 :          $5,317 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For unmarried individuals:  
  <p>
$0-$3,199 :   19% <br> 
$3,200 to $14,400 :   $608 plus 27%  <br>
Over $14,400 :          $3,632 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
For married couples filing separately:  
  <p>
$0-$2,699 :   19%  <br>
$2,700 to $12,000 :   $513 plus 27%  <br>
Over $12,000 :          $3,024 plus 40%  <br>
  <p>
<b>Tax Base, Generally:</b>  The individual tax base would include 
compensation,  most fringe benefits,   
dividends, interest, rents, royalties and other capital income, capital gains and certain other income.    
Gifts, municipal bond interest and certain other income would be excluded from the tax base.  Mortgage   
interest on acquisition indebtedness, certain higher education expense and certain charitable contributions   
would be deductible.  Net savings would generally be deductible.  Net dissavings would generally be   
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Interest, Dividends and Other Investment Income and Expense:</b>  
Interest, royalties, dividends, annuity   
payments, income from life insurance, endowment contracts, distributive share of partnership income (or   
loss) from intangible property and similar investment income would be included in gross income and   
subject to tax.  However, if the income was reinvested (in the sense that the taxpayer increased net   
savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Municipal Bond Interest:</b>  Municipal bond interest would not be 
taxable.  
  <p>
<b>Standard Deduction Family Living Allowance:</b>  The family living 
allowance (equivalent of a standard   deduction) would be:  
  <p>
$7,400 for a joint return or a surviving spouse;<br>  
$5,400 for a head of household;  <br>
$4,400 for a single person;  <br>
$3,700 for a married couple filing separately.<br>  
  <p>
<b>Personal Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per person.  
  <p>
<b>Dependent Exemption:</b>  $2,550 per dependent.  
  <p>
<b>Capital Gains:</b>  Included in gross income.  However, if the income was 
reinvested (in the sense that the   
taxpayer increased net savings), the taxpayer would receive a deduction and the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>Home Ownership:</b>  The home mortgage interest deduction is curtailed 
but retained.  Only acquisition   
indebtedness (but not home equity loan) interest would be deductible.  Tax-free rollover of primary   
residence retained.  Capital gains from the sale of a primary residence are taxed.  However, if the proceeds   
were saved, the tax would be deferred.  
  <p>
<b>State and Local Taxes: </b> Generally not deductible.  
  <p>
<b>Estate and Gift Taxes:</b>  The unified estate and gift tax is retained.  
  <p>
<b>Pensions, IRAs and Other Qualified Plans:</b>  All existing rules 
relating to pensions and qualified plans   
are repealed.  Net savings are deductible and the tax deferred until the taxpayer has net dissavings.   
  <p>
<b>Compensation (Wages & Salaries):</b>  Compensation would be taxable to 
individuals.  Compensation   would not be deductible to businesses.  
  <p>
<b>Charitable Contributions:</b>  Charitable deductions would generally be 
allowed up to 50 percent of a   taxpayers adjusted gross income.  
  <p>
<b>Educational Expenses: </b> A deduction of up to $2,000 per year per 
student for certain higher educational   expenses is allowed.  
  <p>
<b>Savings, Generally:</b>  The return to savings would be taxed unless 
saved.  The taxpayer would be afforded   
a deduction equal to his net savings.  Generally, net savings is the excess, if any, of additions to savings   
over taxable withdrawals from savings.  If taxable withdrawals exceed additions to savings, the net   
withdrawal is included in the taxpayers taxable income.  Savings are broadly defined to include most   
financial assets but exclude collectibles.  
  <p>
<b>Inflation Indexing:</b>  The family living allowance, personal exemptions 
and tax brackets are indexed for   inflation.  
  <p>
<b>Social Security Benefits:</b>  Social Security benefits are fully taxable.

 104th CONGRESS  
 1st Session  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.  
                  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  
               June 22 (legislative day, June 19), 1995  
 Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Faircloth)   
     introduced the following bill; which was read twice and   
     referred to the Committee on Finance  
                                A BILL  
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage capital  
 formation through reductions in taxes on capital gains, and for  
 other purposes.

 `SEC. 1202. CAPITAL GAINS DEDUCTION.  
   `(a) General Rule: If for any taxable year a taxpayer other than   
 a corporation has a net capital gain, 50 percent of such gain shall  
 be a deduction from gross income.  
   `(b) Estates and Trusts: In the case of an estate or trust, the  
 deduction shall be computed by excluding the portion (if any) of   
 the gains for the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital  
 assets which, under sections 652 and 662 (relating to inclusions of  
 amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of trusts), is includible

   `(c) Coordination With Treatment of Capital Gain Under Limitation  
 on Investment Interest: For purposes of this section, the net  
 capital gain for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below

   `(d) Transitional Rule:   
       `(1) In general: In the case of a taxable year which includes  
     January 1, 1995--  
           `(A) the amount taken into account as the net capital   
         gain under subsection (a) shall not exceed the net capital  
         gain determined by only taking into account gains and   
         losses properly taken into account for the portion of the  
         taxable year on or after January 1, 1995, and  
           `(B) if the net capital gain for such year exceeds the  
         amount taken into account under subsection (a), the rate of  
         tax imposed by section 1 on such excess shall not exceed 28  
         percent.  
       `(2) Special rules for pass-thru entities:   
           `(A) In general: In applying paragraph (1) with respect   
         to any pass-thru entity, the determination of when gains   
         and losses are properly taken into account shall be made at  
         the entity level.  
           `(B) Pass-thru entity defined: For purposes of  
         subparagraph (A), the term `pass-thru entity' means--

               `(iii) an S corporation,

     follows:  
       `(4) Adjustments: To the extent that the amount otherwise  
     allowable as a deduction under this subsection consists of gain  
     from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than   
     1 year or gain described in section 1203(a), proper adjustment  
     shall be made for any deduction allowable to the estate or   
     trust under section 1202 (relating to deduction for excess of  
     capital gains over capital losses) or for the exclusion  
     allowable to the estate or trust under section 1203 (relating   
     to exclusion for gain from certain small business stock). In   
     the case of a trust, the deduction allowed by this subsection  
     shall be subject to section 681 (relating to unrelated business  
     income).'.  
       (6) The last sentence of section 643(a)(3) is amended to read  
     as follows: `The deduction under section 1202 (relating to

       (8) Paragraph (4) of section 691(c) is amended by striking  
     `sections 1(h), 1201, 1202, and 1211' and inserting `sections  
     1201, 1202, 1203, and 1211'.  
       (9) The second sentence of section 871(a)(2) is amended by  
     inserting `or 1203' after `section 1202'.  
       (10)(A) Paragraph (2) of section 904(b) is amended by   
     striking subparagraph (A), by redesignating subparagraph (B) as  
     subparagraph (A), and by inserting after subparagraph (A) (as   
     so redesignated) the following new subparagraph:  
           `(B) Other taxpayers: In the case of a taxpayer other   
         than a corporation, taxable income from sources outside the  
         United States shall include gain from the sale or exchange  
         of capital assets only to the extent of foreign source  
         capital gain net income.'.  
       (B) Subparagraph (A) of section 904(b)(2), as so   
     redesignated, is amended--  
           (i) by striking all that precedes clause (i) and   
         inserting the following:  
           `(A) Corporations: In the case of a corporation--', and  
           (ii) by striking in clause (i) `in lieu of applying  
         subparagraph (A),'.  
       (C) Paragraph (3) of section 904(b) is amended by striking  
     subparagraphs (D) and (E) and inserting the following new  
     subparagraph:  
           `(D) Rate differential portion: The rate differential  
         portion of foreign source net capital gain, net capital  
         gain, or the excess of net capital gain from sources within  
         the United States over net capital gain, as the case may   
         be, is the same proportion of such amount as the excess of  
         the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b) over the  
         alternative rate of tax under section 1201(a) bears to the  
         highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).'.  
       (D) Clause (v) of section 593(b)(2)(D) is amended--  
           (i) by striking `if there is a capital gain rate  
         differential (as defined in section 904(b)(3)(D)) for the  
         taxable year,', and  
           (ii) by striking `section 904(b)(3)(E)' and inserting  
         `section 904(b)(3)(D)'.

         the net long-term capital gain, and  
           `(B) one-half of the excess of the net long-term capital  
         loss over the net short-term capital gain.'.  
       (B) So much of paragraph (2) of section 1212(b) as precedes  
     subparagraph (B) thereof is amended to read as follows:  
       `(2) Special rules:   
           `(A) Adjustments:   
               `(i) For purposes of determining the excess referred  
             to in paragraph (1)(A),  
 there shall be treated as short-term capital gain in the taxable  
 year an amount equal to the lesser of--  
   `(I) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1)  
 or (2) of section 1211(b), or  
   `(II) the adjusted taxable income for such taxable year.  
               `(ii) For purposes of determining the excess referred  
             to in paragraph (1)(B), there shall be treated as  
             short-term capital gain in the taxable year an amount  
             equal to the sum of--  
   `(I) the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (1)

 taxable year, whichever is the least, plus

      `(1) a trust which is part of such plan shall not be treated  
    as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a) or any

    transaction for purposes of section 4975.

which would be required if the plan had terminated immediately  
before the qualified transfer (or in the case of a participant who  
separated during the 1-year period ending on the date of the  
transfer, immediately before such separation).  
  `(d) Definition and Special Rule: For purposes of this section--  
      `(1) Excess pension assets: The term `excess pension assets'

    qualified transfer--  
          `(A) any assets transferred in a plan year on or before  
        the valuation date for such year (and any income allocable  
        thereto) shall, for purposes of section 412, be treated as  
        assets in the plan as of the valuation date for such year,  
        and  
          `(B) the plan shall be treated as having a net experience  
        loss under section 412(b)(2)(B)(iv) in an amount equal to  
        the amount of such transfer and for which amortization  
        charges begin for the first plan year after the plan year   
        in which such transfer occurs, except that such section

For Immediate Release:

<B><center> Small Business Group Asks Who Actually 
Possesses the Home Field Advantage in Health
Insurance?
</B></center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Washington, D.C. &#173;&#173; The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a small business advocacy group with more than 40,000
members across the nation, questioned the validity of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield's assertions in Michigan and across the country
that they operate under a clear disadvantage compared with other
insurance firms.<BR>

<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan declared: &quot;Blue Cross and Blue
Shield is excluded from the one of the biggest hurdles to success
that any for&#173;profit enterprise faces: taxes.&quot;  <BR>

<P>
SBSC noted that according to reports from the Michigan State Treasurer's
Office, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) possessed
an $83 million tax advantage in 1995 by not having to pay state
property and single business taxes.<BR>

<P>
BCBSM has turned up the volume on its &quot;level playing field&quot;
offensive as groups opposed to the extreme pre&#173;existing condition
language in H.B. 5572, the Patient Bill of Rights, have cried
foul.  Specifically, the provision would require that no group
health insurance plan can ever exclude for a pre&#173;existing
condition, not even if no prior coverage existed.  According to
SBSC, this will drive up costs, push insurers out of the state,
and government would step in further.<BR>

<P>
SBSC Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating added: &quot;As baseball's
New York Yankees have shown thus far by losing two home games
and winning one on its opponents turf in the World Series, it's
often quite difficult to detect who, if anyone, clearly benefits
from the home field advantage.  The same can be said of the health
insurance field.  Clearly, Blue Cross and Blue Shield gains from
its tax status."

Elections<BR>

<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released
a report Oct. 31 asking the question, "Will
Sweeney Sink or Save Labor?"
 The new report concludes: "Under
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, big labor will be a big loser."
<P>
The report lays out the long decline of labor union
membership and the increasing share of government employees in
labor union ranks.  SBS Foundation forecasts, based on recent
trends, that public-sector employees account for 42% of union
membership, up from a mere 6% in 1960.  As a percent of private
and public workforces, private-sector union membership is in free
fall, while public-sector unionism has stagnated for several years.
<P>
"This trend is not lost on union leaders like Sweeney,"
says SBS Foundation president Karen Kerrigan.  "Big
labor's
massive campaign against Republican members of Congress who favored
spending restraint and market-based policies are antithetical
to the labor movement's
need for coercive government to assist in their organizing efforts,
while propping up their relevancy.  With Republicans keeping control
of Congress, big labor's
failed efforts to reelect a Democrat majority will go down in
history as one of the most wasteful and unsuccessful political
campaigns of the twentieth century.  Labor leaders should have
focused on the task at hand:
building membership and representing the authentic concerns of
its members.  Sweeney is doing neither."
<P>
The report's
author, Raymond J. Keating, SBS Foundation Chief Economist, notes:
"In
an economy where entrepreneurship is on the rise, competition
is intensifying, and technological advancements are bringing about
further decentralization, big labor's
preferences for high taxes, excessive regulation, protectionism,
larger government, and class warfare make no sense.  In addition,
Sweeney's
strategic alignment with other groups in demise, like social activists
of the 1960s variety 
(socialists, left-wing academics, and various big-government groups)
 will only speed, rather than slow, the decline of labor unions.
 I guess misery does love company."

<CENTER><B>Calling a "Salt" a "Salt"
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The pernicious union corporate campaign tactic known
as salting was wounded recently by an administrative law judge
(ALJ) in San Francisco.  In a decision involving Irwin Industries,
the ALJ held that filing "frivolous,
knowingly false"
charges was "an
integral part of the . . . 'fight
back'
strategy that was contrived to force the company to spend substantial
amounts of money defending itself before the"
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 
<P>
The company had hired known Boilermakers Union organizers
in the past, but they had never been a target of "salting"
activity.  However, after an organizer was hired as a supervisor
on a new job, and asked to sign a statement that  asserted "I
am here for the best interest of IRWIN INDUSTRIES, INC. AND NOT
for the benefit of the [boilermakers] . . .," 
he initiated the campaign.
<P>
The organizer and his supporters engaged in a work
slowdown and were subsequently fired for that activity.  Afterwords
a busload of applicants appeared at the company office where they
filled out job applications and wrote the words "voluntary
organizers"
at the top.  The NLRB issued a complaint alleging unlawful discharges
against the organizer and his cohorts, and unlawful refusal to
hire the "volunteer
organizers."
<P>
The judge dismissed the complaint.  He went on to
recommend that the NLRB impose a remedy on the union which blocks
the future filing of bogus charges against the employer.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Sweeney's
Hangover<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
In a <I>Washington Times</I> piece today (November
6 1996) called "Wednesday
hangover,"
AFL-CIO Chief John Sweeney may have taken too much liberty with
rank-and-file dues.
<P>
According to the report:
<P>
<I>
". .class-action lawyers are looking into suing the AFL-CIO on
behalf of its members to return to them the $35 million in dues
that union President John Sweeney spent trying to elect a Democratic
House of Representatives.
<P>
Any such suit could cripple the AFL-CIO for years,
one legal expert suggests.
<P>
Ironically, class-action suits are lucrative for
lawyers and are protected by the liberal Democrats Mr. Sweeney
supports."</I>
<P>
It looks as though shrewd lawyers have figured out
that fewer lawsuit opportunities will be available as the GOP
will likely make another attempt at legal reform.  And with fewer
new regulations and rules being signed into law- 
as is expected to be the case with the new Congress-
why not go after labor unions?
<P>
<I>The massive partisan political campaign waged
against the GOP in the '96
elections, only resulted in 14 GOP freshmen scalps for John Sweeney.</I>

CALL TO ACTION: California's Proposition 65<p>
</b>
November 18, 1996<p>
Issue No. 23<BR>
<hr>
<P>
California's Proposition 65- State Initiatives with National Implications
<br>
</center>
<P>
An unresolved matter between federal OSHA and the
state of California is causing compliance uncertainity for a number
of chemical, paint and coating industries and is <U>certain to
impact any and all businesses that manufacture or distribute products
in California</U>. 
<P>
In 1986, California passed the Safe Drinking Water
and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65).  Prop 65  prohibits
businesses from knowingly and intentionally exposing individuals
to chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without
posting clear and reasonable warnings.  Enforceable  by the California
Attorney General and private citizens groups, Prop 65 subjects
violators to a civil penalty of up to $2,500 a day.  
<P>
Under OSH Act, state specific standards must be federally
approved if they are to be applied to products used or distributed
in interstate commerce. OSH Act also requires that the state standards
not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<P>
The amendment- 
filed in January 1992-
to the California State OSH Plan to implement Prop 65 is pending
at the federal OSH Administration.  Yet, in spite of the fact
that OSHA has not acted on the California amendment, California
has allowed private citizen groups to file Prop 65 enforcement
actions.
<P>
Prop 65 places the burden of proving compliance on
the business. And now businesses that believed they were in compliance
with the federal and state requirements have become the victims
of citizen groups
lawsuits.  Suits have been filed against manufacturers of nail
polish, lead crystal, batteries, faucets, and spray paint.  
<P>
It's important to note that none of these lawsuits have been brought
by, or on the behalf of, industry employees. Because of litigation
costs, several of these suits were settled when companies either
agreed to abstain from selling their products in California, or
reformulate their product, or eliminate the Prop 65 listed substance
from the manufacturing process.
<P>
The large number of products and substances which
might require a Prop 65 warning substantially impacts manufacturers
and distributors of any products containing listed substances
sold in California.
<P>
In April 1995, a group of chemical manufacturers
filed a complaint with OSHA about California state administration
of the amendment.  Just recently (September 1996), the Department
of Labor just recently issued a request for comment on the California
State Standard on Hazard Communication incorporating Prop. 65.

<P>
Many issues including labeling requirements of products,
updating material safety data sheets, violiating the OSH Act and
fighting off "bounty
hunters"
need to be resolved.   <BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Standard 62R<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Standard 62, adopted in 38 states and many local
building codes, sets ventilation requirements for office buildings,
commerical and institutional facilities, and residences.  
<P>
The revised version - Standard 62R - released by
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) is likely to impair the market for many products
manufactured by small companies and  increase operation and maintenance
costs.  
<P>
Standard 62R is likely to:
<P><ul>
<li>force products to be redesigned to satisfy new requirements
of indoor air quality.
<P>
<li>impose substantial paperwork burdens related to maintenance
of warehouses and offices.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install  automatic heating,
ventilating and air conditioning controls.
<P>
<li>impair the market for manufactured products (carpet,
paint, upholstery.
<P>
<li>require emissions from manufactured products to satisfy
health-based standards.
<P>
<li>require small businesses to install and maintain
5 separate building ventiliation systems.
<P></ul>
<B>ASHRAE released the revised standard for public
comment; comments are due December 12, 1996.</b>

<h3>Karen Kerrigan</h3>
<hr width="35%" size="3">
</center>
<blockquote>Karen Kerrigan is president of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC), a nationwide nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization fighting against unchecked government regulation and taxation on America's small business and entrepreneurial sector.  SBSC also works on efforts to reduce the size and scope of government, while promoting policies and reforms which foster economic growth and opportunity.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan also serves as president of the Small Business Survival Foundation, a research and education organization that studies the impact of government policy on entrepreneurship and economic growth.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan is a nationally recognized spokesperson on tax and budget issues, government waste, regulation, grassroots organizing, political activism, coalition building and other political and policy issues relating to reforming government at the local, state and federal levels.  She is an experienced and sought after speaker for business, political and community functions, and has led scores of seminars and programs on effective grassroots organizing.
<P>
Under Ms. Kerrigan's leadership, SBSC is looked to by the media for unique and bottom-line commentary and analysis on a wide range of political and economic issues.  SBSC's work and commentary has been cited by <i>Investor's Business Daily, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, The New York Times, National Journal, Business Week, Entrepreneur, Fortune Magazine, Bloomberg Business New, The Boston Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Michael Reagan Show</i> and hundreds of local newspapers and television news and radio programs nationwide.
<P>
Ms. Kerrigan has gained increased prominence in the 104th Congress through her stewardship of SBSC.  She has taken the organization from a small regional organization to a dynamic national group impacting the policy debates inside the nation's capitol.  The organization's unwavering principled stand on tax, budget and other issues has set it above the traditional business lobby in Washington.  
<P>

<p>
Overhauling our nation's tax system ... pessimists say it will never happen -- optimists
simply claim they are in economic nirvana as the debate continues
to swirl around them. Not only has the national debate commenced,
but real pro- posals have been advanced and committee hearings
are already taking place in the United States Congress.
<p>
Every American taxpayer is impacted by the broken tax code. Small businesses
and entrepreneurs are particularly hard hit by our punishing,
complex system. The horde of taxes required of them from all levels
of government, com- pounded by the cost and burden of tax compliance,
and the fact that our perplex- ing system changes with the wind,
make the issue of taxation invariably the num- ber one concern
of small enterprises nationwide. 
<p>
Which of the leading tax overhaul proposals is the best system for America and small businesses
and entrepreneurs? The Small Business Survival Foundation (SBS
Foundation) is attempting to answer this question, as we study,
examine, analyze and criticize the various proposals as they become
more spe- cific, then overlay those proposals on the small business,
entrepreneurial sector for closer scrutiny. 
<p>
Over the next couple of years, the U.S. Congress will continue to debate which tax
system is best for America. As the "race to the White House" heats up, tax overhaul will become a central issue. 
<p>
One principle has become more solidified as the debate continues -- the entrepreneur
must remain at the core of our economic model. How to stoke the
entrepreneurial spirit must remain at the forefront of developing
a new tax sys- tem. The current U.S. tax code is a catastrophic
failure in this regard -- it punishes risk taking and entrepreneurship,
thus damaging economic growth and opportunity for all Americans.
<p>
The great tax debate has indeed just begun. It is exciting to
watch long-time allies of tax overhaul debating the merits of
each of the proposed systems. I am thrilled that this debate is
taking place. And, I remain optimistic that small businesses
and entrepreneurs -- the backbone of the American economy -- will,
in the end, be the winners of this long overdue revolution in our tax system.

<p>
 We are about to begin one of the most exciting, important debates in our his- tory -- what
kind of tax system we will have as we enter the 21st Century
and the Third Millennium. 
<p>
Public disgust with the current code grows and grows. Americans deeply resent a system which defies understanding, smothers growth, and invites corruption and manipulation.
<p>
Raymond Keating's short, lucid booklet couldn't be better timed.
It will enable concerned citizens to understand the essentials
of this upcoming debate. Keating quickly captures the flaws of
our tax system and then simply and fairly summarizes the alternatives
-- the flat tax, the national sales tax, the value-added tax
and the so-called consumed-income tax. 
<p>
The author's easy-to-understand checklist of criteria enables readers to see why the VAT and the consumed-income tax should be quickly discarded. The flat tax
and a national retail sales tax would both benefit the economy
and be a vast improvement over what we have now. At the end of
this booklet, Keating provides the two utopian versions of these
alternatives. Even if you think them unrealistic, they will make
you realize how truly "low-rated" a tax system can be!
<p>
This booklet will be an essential tool in stoking the debate.
The'96 election is absolutely critical. Unless voters have an
opportunity to give an unmistakable mandate for a fundamental
overhaul, an overhaul will not happen. Too many forces will oppose
it and gut it. Be wary of candidates who refuse to firmly advocate a specific alternative. Timidity, generalities, good intentions will be insufficient to bring about a true tax revolution. <p>
Personally, I am an unabashed advocate of the Dick Armey flat tax. There may
be better alternatives, but I believe it has the best chance to
win political approval next year. But this gets to the virtue
of this booklet -- it succinctly gives you the information you
need to make up your own mind and, just as importantly, to get
involved!

<p>
Entrepreneurs drive the economy. By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations,
the entrepreneur ensures economic renewal and growth. While government
can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing
property rights, government unfortunately more often than not
cre- ates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth. Perhaps
the most for- midable of the many governmental obstacles thrown
in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the
U.S. federal income tax code. 
<p>
As constituted today, the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess. It is complicated,
inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship,
investment, economic growth, and job creation. 
<p>
In fact, only narrow
special interests, lobbyists, lawyers, and tax accountants can
derive any benefit from the current, complex income tax system.
Of course, the system can be largely attributed to their influence
peddling in our nation's organized interests, a complete overhaul
of our tax system has verged on fantasy for the past six to
seven decades - <i>until now</i>. 
<p>
"The Great Tax Debate" has arrived in Washington, D.C. A variety of tax overhaul proposals
are being given serious consideration not only in the many think
tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape but in
the Halls of Congress. 
<p>
In the following pages, we shall examine
criteria for a sound tax system, review the main problems of our
current tax system, analyze alternative proposals, and outline
an ideal tax plan that promotes entrepreneurship and economic
growth. Leading ideas for replacing the current income tax system
include a flat income tax, a national retail sales tax, a "consumed-income"
tax, or a value- added tax (VAT). 

Naturally, every form of taxation has a downside - our goal should be to minimize such distortions our current income tax system fails this test miserably, and the search is on for an imporved tax system.

Co-Owner<br>
Cornrows & Co.<p></h3>
<h4>An Opposition To An Increase In<br>
The Minimum Wage</h4> 
<hr>
<p>
</center>
<blockquote>
Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, my name
is Taalib-Din Abdul Uqdah.  I am the co-owner of Cornrows &amp;
Co., a hair-braiding salon located in Washington, D.C..  I thank
the Small Business Committee for the opportunity to appear before
you today.  Given the direct impact of the proposed unfunded mandate
on small business operations, I think it is vitally important
that the United States Congress hear from small business owners.
 I appreciate the Committee giving small businesses, like mine,
a voice in this process.  <BR>
<P>
I started my business, Cornrows &amp; Co., in June
1980 with $500, a 4-year lease on a building owned by someone
else, and three employees.  Today, I employ 12 full-time people,
including my wife and myself, two part-time people and I have
consistently grossed approximately $500,000 annually.  My most
crowning achievement is that I now own a 4,000 square foot building,-
and it is valued at over $400,000.<BR>
<P>
I have been self-employed for 22 years.  Over the
last 16 years, I have discovered that one of the biggest obstacles
to small business growth is government interference and micro-management.
 I have spent nearly 12 years fighting state government's for
the right to operate my business in the United States, free of
nonsensical bureaucratic regulations.  And now this: an unfunded
mandate.<BR>
<P>
For this and a host of other reasons to follow, I
oppose an increase in the starting wage.  The proposals by President
Clinton and members of Congress to increase the starting wage
creates another hurdle for small business growth.  It  represents
another death nail in the coffin of the United States' free enterprise
system and makes a mockery of the notion that we can produce,
manufacture, and exchange goods and services free of government
regulation and interference.  Because of federal legislation,
the free market system no longer exists.  As a champion of that
system, I oppose a <U>mandated</U> starting wage.  And I most
definitely oppose an <U>increase</U> in the starting wage.<BR>
<P>
The government should protect free enterprise, not
hinder it.  Has this Congress or the Clinton Administration given
any thought to the consequences of their &quot;feel good&quot;
legislation on the small businesses that create America's job
opportunities?  <BR>
<P>
By forcing me to pay a mandated minimum wage, <U>with
no consideration given to my business operations, market conditions
or feasibility studies</U>, not only does the federal government
imply its distrust of me as a businessperson, but also, the government
risk the employment of low-skilled people - the purported beneficiaries
of the proposed wage hike.<BR>
<P>
For the people of the District of Columbia, the impact
of a mandated wage hike will have implications well beyond the
political grandstanding of those interested in creating &quot;feel-good,
election year&quot; legislation.<BR>
<P>
  First, minimum-wage workers know that the more
they earn, the more federal, state, county and/or local government's
will claim for taxes.  The impact of the wage hike on the take-home
pay of minimum wage earners will be negligible.  <BR>
<P>
Second, while the impact of the wage hike on the
take-home pay would be negligible for minimum wage earners, the
impact of the mandate on employers would be substantial.  As payroll
dollars increase, so does employers' cost for worker's compensation,
Social Security, Medicare, and both federal and local unemployment
compensation. <BR>
<P>
Third, under existing law, businesses operating in
the District of Columbia must pay minimum wage employees $1 above
the federal rate.  Currently in D.C., unskilled employees' wages
start at $5.25 an hour.  If Congress mandates President Clinton's
proposal to raise the starting wage by $0.90, I would be forced
to pay an untrained, unskilled worker $6.15 per hour.  <BR>
<P>
How can I afford to bring in an unskilled worker,
when for the duration of the training period, he or she generates
no revenue?  What if this employee leaves during the training
period?  What about my losses?  Where is my incentive to hire
an unskilled employee who requires extensive and intensive training,
generates no revenue, and costs me a minimum of $50 per day? 
<BR>
<P>
The District of Columbia's current starting wage
-- at a rate higher than the federal mandate -- already forces
me and other employers to close the door on applicants unqualified
to do the job at $5.25 an hour.  Are these applicants more qualified
at $6.15 an hour?<BR>
<P>
An increase in the starting wage will not benefit
low-skilled workers. To counter the starting wage increase, small
businesses, like mine, will not hire low-skilled workers.  Some
employers may even reduce current employee hours or raise prices.
 All of these effects risk the livelihood of the low-skilled worker,
again, the &quot;ghostly&quot; beneficiary of a wage increase.
<BR>
<P>
I cannot afford to hire unskilled applicants at the
minimum wage.  The cost of their employment would be too great
a burden for my business.  It is more cost effective for me to
hire a skilled worker.   Pay the skilled worker one and one-half
times more than the unskilled worker, and watch as the skilled
employee generates at least three times the revenue that an unskilled
employee could.  <BR>
<P>
A federally mandated starting wage does not work.
 Bureaucrats should stop imposing artificial wage rates on businesses.
 The unemployment effect that results from an increase will be
concentrated on the most disadvantaged of the work force -- unskilled,
at-risk youths.  <BR>
<P>
Further, the mandated starting wage implies that
the marketplace does not work.  This simply is not true.<BR>
<P>
In every industry, there is a need to keep quality
employees. And quality employees are paid based on their productivity
and worth, not on an arbitrary number selected by politicians.
 <BR>
<P>
<U>I started all of my employees at the minimum wage.</U>
 After a training period in which they increased their skills,
I increased their salary.  Now all of my employees <U>earn</U>
well above the minimum wage.<BR>
<P>
Know this: <U>I</U> increase my employees' salary,
not because the government commands me to, but because my employees
<U>earn</U> their salary increases.  I and other employers do
not need the government to micro-manage our businesses.<BR>

<P>
Small businesses, like mine, generate jobs.  Yet,
ever-increasing tax rates and regulatory burdens already destroys
incentives for small business creation in  cities.  Increasing
the minimum wage undoubtedly increases the tax and regulatory
costs of business operations.  As any economist knows, increasing
the regulatory and tax burden of small businesses will make economic
growth for the District or any municipality nonexistent. <BR>
<P>
Where is the &quot;feel good&quot; measure for business?
Where are the incentives and initiatives that induce me to hire
more workers, open more establishments, invest in the District's
economy?  What is being done to make the wage hike more palatable
for the small business owner already besieged by taxes and regulations?
<BR>
<P>
The wage hike proposal did not start the United States
down the road to economic ruin; no, that started when Congress
decided it had to regulate businesses in this country. <BR>
<P>
I was led to believe by the Clinton Administration
and members of Congress that the era of big government was over.
 I do not see an end to big government. </FONT>
<P>
We need a system that supports a free market economy
and increases business growth, opportunity and employment for
all Americans.  I urge the U.S. Congress to oppose an increase
in the minimum wage.  <BR>
<P>
Again, I thank the Committee and I look forward to
answering any questions you may have.</FONT>

<h3>"Superfund and Small Business"</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Committee on Small Business
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>


Mrs. Chairwoman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss Superfund's impact on small businesses and ideas for reform.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	Since its creation in 1980, Superfund has unleashed the bloated bureaucracy and gross inefficiencies of the federal government on unsuspecting businesses across the nation; turned essentially local or, at most, state problems into national woes;  set arbitrary and unattainable criteria for compliance; sent legal costs skyrocketing; forced many businesses to close their doors; reduced capital available for investment in certain industries; restrained job growth; and damaged U.S. international competitiveness.  Quite a record for one piece of legislation, but there is still more.<P>	

Small businesses -- whether seeking out additional capital for growth or just fighting to stay alive -- are particularly vulnerable to the woes of Superfund.  Legal costs, expenditures for cleaning up sites to which they contributed little, groping through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bureaucracy, and a thick governmental fog obscuring future costs and risks, can stop a small business in its tracks and even kill it.<P>	

At the core of Superfund's problems is its mechanism for assigning liability to perfectly innocent parties.  If a business disposed of waste -- toxic or non-toxic, large or insignificant amounts -- in good conscience and in complete accordance with the law, it can still be held liable for the costs of cleaning up the disposal site if it later became a Superfund site.  Notions of responsibility and fairness mean absolutely nothing under Superfund.<P>	

Indeed, in assigning liability under Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) utilizes highly questionable criteria:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Superfund allows for strict liability, i.e., regardless of intent or negligence.<P>

<LI> Superfund liability is retroactive, meaning that actions taken before the law was enacted still apply.  So even if firms were in full compliance of the law, Superfund still exposes them to liability.<P>

<LI> Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore, the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire clean up irrespective of the degree of its own contribution to the waste site and without consideration to the total number of contributors.  No concept of "fair share" exists under Superfund.  Seeking relief, this unfortunate EPA selectee files contribution suits against other businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties tend to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.  Legal costs balloon.<P>

<LI> Current or past owners of a Superfund site who contributed absolutely nothing to the waste problem can be held liable.<P>

<LI> The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove their innocence rather than the EPA proving guilt under Superfund.<P>	

The EPA's main criteria for assigning liability for a Superfund site often seems to merely be "deep pockets" -- whoever is able to pay will pay for a site clean up.  Of course, this is not an ironclad rule.  After all, sometimes deep pockets cannot be found, in which case anyone will do -- including small businesses with but the most distant relationship to the site.  And even if the EPA finds "deep pockets," these same "deep pockets" seek to recover their own costs by bringing contribution suits against these same small enterprises. </ul>
<P>As one might expect, this system has developed into a costly, legal quagmire.  Individual Superfund horror stories abound -- seemingly too numerous to count.  These are well documented, and I certainly can supply the Committee with many, but for now I would like to touch upon some of the overall, weighty costs of Superfund.  For example:<P>
<ul>
<LI> Of the 1,292 "worst" waste sites on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL), only 237 have been cleaned up -- about 18 percent -- according to Heritage Foundation analyst John Shanahan.  One should note that this is a more optimistic accounting of cleaned up sites.  On February 14, 1994, for example, Business Week reported that out of 1,270 sites on the Superfund list just 49 "have been completely cleaned up."<P>

<LI> Yet, the federal government has spent almost $10 billion on Superfund and forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  The average NPL site takes 10 years to clean up at an average cost of $30 million.  <P>

<LI> On average, transaction costs account for 32 
percent of total private-sector Superfund costs, with litigation making up 65 percent of this amount or 21 percent of total costs.<P>

<LI> Once caught in the Superfund liability morass, it becomes much more difficult for a firm to attract capital, make investments, and therefore, grow and create jobs.  Superfund's strict, retroactive, and joint and several liabilities create considerable uncertainties for firms.  Such unknown costs chase away investors and make expansion plans quite dubious.<P>

Small businesses suffer most under these added costs and 
risks.  Without the Superfund cloud hanging over it, investing in, starting up, and expanding a small venture is already a risky undertaking.  Superfund liabilities only raise the hurdles faced by small business even further.<P>

<LI> Superfund also creates disincentives for investment in long industrialized urban areas.  The threat of enormous liability discourages firms from buying land in and renewing formerly industrialized areas.  Instead, it's safer to build new facilities elsewhere.  So many U.S. cities already impose large burdens on the private sector -- including high taxes, heavy regulations, bloated government budgets, and more -- and Superfund adds to these costs.  Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that the entrepreneur is becoming an endangered species in many U.S. cities.<P>

<LI> Finally, according to a Center for the Study of American Business  Superfund study, "Superfund imposes much more stringent regulations on manufacturing and other firms doing business in the United States than these companies would be required to meet in other countries."  Interestingly, in nations like Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and others, liability rarely reaches entities that legally disposed of their waste; instead, liability is linked to fault.<P>
</ul>
What should be done?  Understanding the 
constraints of the political process, the Small Business Survival Committee supports a three-step reform plan.<P>

As a first step, we support many measures currently under consideration in Congress, including repealing retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, as suggested by U.S. Representative Bill Zeliff (R-NH) in his proposed Superfund reform bill -- thereby eliminating costly litigation at about 80 percent of Superfund sites; from 1987 forward, basing liability on the proportion of waste a party contributed to the site; using science-based risk assessment to determine clean up remedies; capping the Superfund NPL of sites so that the Superfund program can be phased out; and no imposition of any new taxes.<P>	

As a second step, the Small Business Survival Committee supports the complete repeal of the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes.  To achieve real fairness, even proportional liability must give way.   Superfund should only assign liability to individuals and businesses who broke the law, who were negligent, fraudulent, deceptive , etc.  This is the only true "polluter pays" scenario.  Small businesses, or any sized business, that simply sent waste to a site in an honest manner, in full compliance with the law, should have absolutely no liability whatsoever.  In essence, they are not polluters.  <P>	Step three, or the final goal of Superfund reform, should be to terminate Superfund.  In fact, a waste site clean up is not a federal issue, unless, of course,  operated by the federal government or undertaken due to a new federal law or mandate.  In these two instances, federal responsibility is clear.  Otherwise, waste site clean ups should be left as local, or at most,  state issues.  Localities are in a better position to judge the costs and benefits of clean ups.  If completely unable to carry the costs of a necessary clean up, then state government should be turned to for assistance.    <P>	

State and local clean-up efforts have proved to be far more efficient, timely, and less costly.  Local individuals possess a far better understanding of their community's circumstances and needs than do EPA bureaucrats.<P>	

Once again, I thank you for inviting me here today to address the Superfund issue, and I would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

<title>   Testimony of Karen Kerrigan on Spectrum Allocation

<center><h3>Testimony of Karen Kerrigan<BR>
President<BR>
Small Business Survival Committee</h3>

<h4>Before
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
September 12, 1995
<P>
On Spectrum Allocation</h4></center>
<hr>



Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
<P>
I am here today representing the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) -- a 40,000 
member nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization which fights against the growing burden 
of taxes and regulations on America's small businesses and entrepreneurs -- SBSC supports free 
markets over government industrial policy.  SBSC also spearheads the Campaign for Broadcast 
Competition, a coalition of advocacy organizations opposing the proposed giveaway of the 
spectrum to the nation's broadcasters.   
<P>
I am especially pleased to be here today.  It is not often that one has the opportunity to 
publicly oppose what many have said will be the most expensive case of corporate welfare in the 
history of our Nation.
<P>
I am speaking, of course, about the proposed giveaway of the nation's airwaves to the 
broadcasting industry.  This is the expensive residue of a failed industrial policy, and it can, and 
should be reversed.
<P>
The story starts innocently enough with an "America first" technology program.  It turned 
into an unprecedented government giveaway of taxpayer-owned airwaves.  And, absent 
Congressional action, it will conclude by rewarding an industry which has time and again turned 
its back on its public service obligations.
<P>
As you know, Mr. Chairman, the Federal Communications Commission seven years ago 
pursued a plan to make High Definition Television (HDTV) the broadcasting standard for the 
United States.  As part of that plan, the FCC proposed giving the broadcasters new spectrum to 
allow them to move from analog television to HDTV.  Once HDTV was in place, the theory was, 
the analog spectrum would be returned to the government.<P>
<P>
As is often the case with bureaucrats playing venture capitalists, the market outsmarted 
and surpassed the government's chosen industrial "winner."  In this case, digital technology far 
outstripped the ability of bureaucrats to see into the future, rendering all of this planning for 
HDTV, for all intensive purposes, obsolete.
<P>
With the new digital technology each new digital TV channel can be used for one HDTV 
signal.  Or, it can be split into 6 very high quality digital TV signals.  (In other words  the 
spectrum gift combined with new digital technology now transforms CBS into 6 CBS's; ABC 
into 6 ABC's and so on).
<P>
This free new spectrum need not be used just for television; it will unlock an unlimited 
number of new lucrative businesses for the broadcasters.  The spectrum could be used to provide 
72 digital radio channels, computer data delivery, wireless telephone service, pay TV -- or any 
combination of each of them -- as well as other profitable uses.
<P>
In the face of the new technology, the broadcasters profess a continued commitment to
HDTV and the use of the new Advanced Television (ATV) channels for HDTV. 
<P>                                                                                                    
...Or maybe not.  This year the broadcasters have insisted on receiving the "flexibility" to 
use the spectrum as they see fit.   Broadcasters are actively exploring the opportunities for 
potential new services -- as they should be.  The questions today are:  why are the broadcasters 
the chosen few for the privilege of "spectrum flexibility," and why should they get it for free!
<P>
Now, as the broadcasters freely admit, HDTV is a technological and economic dinosaur.  
They don't want to be shackled to it, nor should they.  There is no market for it, and other digital 
technologies would use the airwaves far more efficiently.
<P>
The broadcasters correctly realize that new digital technology will transform communications as we know it.  And what they want is the valuable distribution pipeline -- the 
spectrum -- with no strings attached.  They clearly do not want it for the purpose for which it was 
intended -- providing HDTV.  They may want it to provide digital television.  But, no one really 
knows, since the technology is changing almost daily.
<P>
But while the broadcasters don't want to be held to the HDTV implementation, they still 
want the additional spectrum -- free of charge.  Why?  Because it is valuable.  If this spectrum 
were auctioned as the PCS spectrum was last year, it could raise between $10 billion and $100 
billion.
<P>
Even in Washington, that's a lot of money.  These market value estimates are not just 
random numbers picked out of  a hat.  Even the FCC conservatively estimates that the spectrum 
is worth between $11 billion and $70 billion.1  <P>In response to questions from the Senate, the FCC has attempted to calculate the potential value of the spectrum.  Within the past few weeks, ITT and Dow Jones paid a whopping $207 million to buy WNYC, New York City's local public UHF station.  The station has few hard assets, no programming appeal -- its new owners are going to switch to commercial programming, with a limited viewership . . . In short, the 26 companies who bid for WNYC wanted to pay big bucks for one thing, its spectrum.
<P>
Based solely on the $207 million paid for WNYC, the FCC valued the spectrum 
potentially at $37 billion.
<P>
"Even" at $37 billion, the figure is more than double the amount this committee needs to 
raise to reach its target in the massive effort to balance the federal budget.  And, the FCC says 
this a conservative estimate.  Some experts estimate that the market value of the digitized spectrum in the not too distant future will reach nearly a half-trillion dollars.
<P>
And the FCC doesn't disagree.2   In a May 5th letter, the FCC said that private market valuation of the spectrum in the future might approach $500 billion.<P>Why this special gift of largesse to the broadcasters?  The proposed giveaway not only flys in the face of efforts to balance the budget but also bucks a profound message that voters sent to Washington last November -- no more coddling of special interests at the expense of other Americans.<P>The giveaway to the broadcasters can't be a reward for the great job they've done serving 
the public good --  as they claim, and as required by their current licenses.  As everyone who has 
a TV knows, and as numerous Congressional hearings this year have shown, the broadcasters 
have done a good job at packing the airwaves with programming that the majority of American 
households find troubling and offensive.
<P>
One media reviewer said that the broadcasters' motto for the upcoming fall lineup must 
be:  "To hell with kids.  Many of the wholesome sitcoms that once ruled the 8:00-9:00 pm hour 
have gone to the graveyard, replaced by racier fair. . ."3<P>The news coverage is no better.  The president of NBC's News Division, Andrew Lack, admitted that "too often we now choose, without a moment's hesitation, to report the story that makes you fell repulsion over the story that makes you think -- which in television means usually boring."  Mr. Lack went on to ask his peers:  "And why do we keep pushing it?  Are we all just whores in search of another share point or a better November book?"4 <P>While the broadcasters hide behind their "unique public service" responsibilities as an argument to shield them from a prospective auction of the valuable spectrum; the public, media critiques and now industry insiders question their competency in this regard.<P>Of course, competition in the form of cable, direct broadcast satellite, on-line computer services and more has given consumers added viewing choices.  Broadcasters have not gone the wayside because of this competition.  Their bottom-lines and profits continue to increase.
<P>
The broadcasters plead that to pay for spectrum will kill "free" TV.  But the recent 
purchase prices and bids for the networks prove that investment money is available for those who 
want to have the privilege of providing "free" TV.  Walt Disney, which paid $19.3 billion for 
ABC/Cap Cities obviously sees investment pay-offs.  Westinghouse which offered $5.4 billion 
for CBS appears to view the business as profitable as well.
<P>
In the past year alone, the networks combined revenues were $21.42 billion.  Their 
combined profits were $2.82 billion.   Clearly, broadcasting is more profitable than ever.
<P>
Robert Wright, [president] of NBC, recently told the National Press Club that "right now 
broadcast television -- and NBC -- are both having banner years.  And even more important, the 
fundamentals of the industry are looking strong as well."  Congratulations Mr. Wright.  Keep up 
the good work.  Apparently advertising-supported TV is doing fine, and will continue to profit 
handsomely -- without a big government handout.
<P>
The FCC agrees with Mr. Wright:  over-the-air broadcasting is and will continue to 
thrive.5     In a September letter, the FCC pointed to the ABC, CBS and WNYC deals, and concluded that:  "free over-the-air television is such a lucrative business, there is no reason to believe that either analog or digital broadcasters will cease providing this service."<P>Finally, advertising-supported broadcasting will only go away if its viewership goes 
away.  If the audience is there, advertisers will continue to subsidize what the broadcasters 
modestly call "free" TV by paying for the right to reach viewers.
<P>
The broadcasters also claim that "they" shouldn't be singled our for auctions, and that the 
Commerce Committee should auction the government spectrum first.
<P>
However, as Faye Anderson one of my close colleagues has recently stated, comparing 
the broadcast spectrum to government spectrum is like comparing "pork loin to pig's feet."
<P>
According to Dale Hatfield, a noted spectrum expert and Reagan Administration 
technology official, this is the cleanest spectrum available.  It is beachfront property.  Mr. 
Chairman, to paraphrase Willie Sutton, if you are going to raise money through auctions, you 
must go where the value is.
<P>
More importantly, the broadcasters are not the only users who have been asked to pay for 
the public airwaves.  As the Committee well knows, Congress in 1993 mandated that the FCC  
auction all licenses for new spectrum.  For example, the FCC already has sold only a part of the 
PCS spectrum for $8 billion.  That's $8 billion that went to the US Treasury.
<P>
If they want to play, let's have them pay.  If it is good enough for PCS, it is good enough 
for all the new businesses the broadcasters hope to pursue.
<P>
Now, the broadcasters have two other arguments.  First, they argue that such a large 
auction of spectrum will depress values and thus won't raise much money.  Then, they argue that 
broadcasters couldn't possibly afford the spectrum, and thus couldn't provide digital television.  
Our question is, which one is it?
<P>
Either way, the public wins.  We tend to believe that there will be buyers for this 
spectrum.  The FCC agrees.  With all the possible benefits of digital broadcasting, the FCC 
expects that numerous companies, <u>including the broadcasters</U>, will compete for and likely win many digital licenses.6   In other words, somewhere between here and the auction block, the broadcasters will figure out ways to participate in the bidding process.
<P>
This, of course, begs the question:  is the government and the U.S. taxpayer responsible 
for guaranteeing NBC's long-term success, or any other broadcaster's?  I don't think so.
<P>
One last question:  under the current broadcaster proposal, the broadcasters will retain 
their analog signal for anywhere between 10 and 15 years, when digital TV becomes the 
standard.  What happens after 15 years and digital TV has only penetrated 80 percent of the 
market or 90 percent or even 95 percent?  Is Congress going to turn off the analog signal just like 
that?  Even if millions upon millions of their constituents are still watching analog televisions?  
In short, the broadcasters will continue to own their analog licenses for the foreseeable future and 
beyond, even while they get to exploit the myriad new digital technologies.  This is unfair no 
matter how you slice it.
<P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Commerce Committee, I realize that the broadcasters 
have been an extremely powerful lobby in Washington.  Given the upsurge in interest we have 
seen on this issue, I think that their political dominance, as with this deal, is largely a thing of the 
past.
<P>
What you have today is an opportunity  -- perhaps the last opportunity in the foreseeable 
future -- to encourage the development of an innovative, competitive, profitable broadcasting 
future, instead of tying the future to the history of the past fifty years.
<P>
You have the opportunity to raise tens of billions of dollars and in so doing demonstrate a 
careful stewardship of one of our nation's most valuable assets.
<P>
And you have the chance to encourage competition while destroying the most egregious 
of set-asides.
<P>
In his June speech, Mr. Wright spoke of the need to encourage change and competition in the communications marketplace.
<P>
Technological change is already upon us:  new digital technologies will soon allow the 
new spectrum to be used to transmit multiple digital TV signals; additional subscription services 
-- like HBO; newspapers; local news and data; computer/video games. . .the options are nearly 
endless.
<P>
The problem is that the broadcasters now ask that Congress give them a free ride in this 
technological carnival.  Mr. Wright recently estimated that this market generates $100 billion in 
annual revenues.7  And NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and all the other broadcasters want in. . . the easy, cheap way.<P>Of course, they're already all already part way there.  NBC alone: owns two 24-hour cable 
networks, has interests in 19 other cable networks, has multiple international broadcasting 
properties; and has entered the new computer-media market with NBC Desktop Video, NBC 
Digital Publishing and NBC Data Network.

<P>
Clearly, the broadcasters are financially capable and market savvy enough to identify and exploit new markets.  They don't need the government's help.  They already control a majority of 
the TV market.  We don't need to give them a head start in the race to win the digital 
marketplace.
<P>
I look forward to discussing this issue with you and answering any questions you have.
<P>
Thank you.           <P>

<h3>Dismantling the U.S. Department of Commerce</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>
 Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology
<br>Government Reform and Oversight Committee
<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the "Department of Commerce Dismantling Act."  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.

<P>	Let me start off by putting your minds at ease.  In no way does the survival of America's small businesses depend upon the continuing existence of the U.S. Department of Commerce, despite what some Commerce Department supporters may tell you.  For example, in a Small Business Survival Committee survey earlier this year, we found that 65 percent of small business owners saw the government as an opponent, while only 34 percent perceived government as a partner.  While the Commerce Department may help a few, select businesses, the other businesses and taxpayers who foot the bill see it as just another federal government department costing them money.  In contrast, the dismantling of the Commerce Department could have a very significant, positive impact on the entrepreneurial sector of our economy.	<P>
Rather than perpetuating failed industrial policy in the form of the Commerce Department, the most productive steps Congress can take to help the entrepreneur would be to downsize government, cut taxes, deregulate industry, and lower trade barriers -- essentially, get government out of the way.  The Small Business Survival Committee believes that the seemingly relentless trek toward a $2-trillion federal government must be stopped and reversed.  Eliminating the Commerce Department is an important early step in this process for three main reasons:
<ul>
<li> First, as described in the attached Small Business Survival Committee report, which I ask be placed into the record, the Commerce Department is a $3.6 billion department filled with programs and endeavors that either would be better left to the private sector (such as economic development and technology investment), or should be moved to other federal departments (like the Patent and Trademark Office to the Justice Department).
<P>
<li> Second, the Commerce Department stands as an example of the grand delusion of government's powers and abilities.  Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also stated that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Program would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  Indeed, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Again, Secretary Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, the federal government's role should be limited to lowering trade barriers.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served, as I've already said,  if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> Third, if you are going to cut spending across the federal budget, as the Small Business Survival Committee urges Congress to do, then it makes sense to start with the easy cuts.  
<P>The Commerce Department is an easy cut.  If you can't make the easy cuts, then what happens when you get to the more politically difficult, though still very much economically sound, spending reductions?  
</ul><P>
The Commerce Department does not serve the taxpayers well and should be eliminated.  It is the Small Business Survival Committee's position that this be done in a timely fashion.  We support the idea of the Commerce Programs Resolution Agency (CPRA) being given a set time period in which to dismantle the department and then terminate its own operations.  

<P>
While not offering specifics in terms of budgets and resources for CPRA, we assume it will be a lean entity operating on a portion of the savings from the immediate cuts in Commerce Department programs.  The Small Business Survival Committee does offer a few principles that should govern the Commerce Department termination process:
<ul>
<li> The goals and mission of the CPRA should be clear cut from the beginning.  The final resting place for each program and agency within the Commerce Department should be already determined (i.e., either termination, privatization, or transfer to another agency) prior to the CPRA team being established.
<P>
<li> Congress should be strict with its time limitation on the CPRA, and leave no door ajar for extensions.  Indeed, we urge you to more closely examine whether three years are actually necessary to carry out this process.  It seems rather lengthy.   After all it does not take a business that was sunk by high taxes and onerous regulations that long to close its doors.
<P>
<li> To ensure that the CPRA remains a temporary entity that does not turn into a permanent bureaucracy, the Small Business Survival Committee suggests that its duties be contracted out to a private firm specializing in organizational overhauls and business downsizings.  The firm's performance would be reviewed regularly while under contract.  Indeed, Congress should offer incentives to speed up the process of closing the doors of the Commerce Department in order to save taxpayer dollars.
<P>
<li> The CPRA should be viewed neither as an extension of the Commerce Department or as a new agency.  Instead, it should be viewed as a temporary transition team to shut down the Commerce Department.  In fact, Congress probably should not call it an "agency" at all -- avoiding any sense of permanency.
</ul>
<P>
In closing, I would just urge you to be bold.  The vast majority of America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers see a clear need for reducing government's role in the economy.  Eliminating the Commerce Department should be the beginning of downsizing the federal government.	Thank you again for inviting me here today, and I would be glad to answer any of your questions.

<h3>Reforming OSHA</h3> 
<b>Testimony by<br>

Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<P>

before the <br>
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections<br>Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities<P>U.S. House of 
Representatives</b></center>
<hr>
<P>	


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, and OSHA  reform in general.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<P>	

How could anyone find fault with a government agency named the "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"?  However, in fact, there is much to find fault with at OSHA.  OSHA has become a burdensome regulatory body which seems to be more concerned with paper pushing and imposing fines rather than with assisting businesses in establishing safer working environments. This is the view justifiably held by many business owners and operators, including most of the Small Business Survival Committee's 40,000 members.  Indeed, a recent nationwide survey of 500 small businesses sponsored by SBSC revealed that OSHA ranked with the IRS and the EPA as the most burdensome federal agencies.<P>	

Contrary to the view of OSHA's most enthusiastic proponents, the private sector possesses every incentive to maintain a safe and healthy working environment for employees.  Indeed, beyond a commonly held concern for one's employees, the financial incentives for safety are substantial.  I.e., safety pays.  "Safety" costs for U.S. business in 1992 were estimated in excess of $200 billion, far outweighing the $72 million in OSHA citations.<P>	

Workplaces that are not safe have always been and remain the exception rather than the rule.  OSHA acts under the opposite assumption, thereby imposing significant and unnecessary costs on business and the economy.  Such costs translate into less entrepreneurship, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs.  It is time that OSHA's regulations and activities reflect the fact that most businesses do indeed maintain "safe and healthful working conditions."<P>	The evidence that OSHA has gone far astray from an educational, advisory and cooperative relationship with business is substantial.  Indeed, OSHA's concern for real safety seems lost in a bureaucratic and regulatory haze of paperwork, citation quotas, and remarkably inane regulations.  I have outlined some of these developments, along with other related facts about OSHA regulations and expenditures, in the accompanying paper entitled "Warning: OSHA Can Be Hazardous to the Nation's Economic Health."  I ask that this short analysis be submitted into the record.<P>	

There are three points from this analysis I would like to mention here.  First, OSHA manages to combine two of the worst aspects of government regulatory bodies.  It creates an incredible paperwork burden on U.S. business.  In 1994, seven of the top ten most frequent OSHA citations were related to paperwork.  OSHA has perfected the government "make work" scheme -- generate a blizzard of paperwork regulations and then fine businesses for not complying.<P>	

Second, a prevailing problem with government regulation and inspections of any industry or workplace is that most, if not all, regulators are not experts in particular industries.  If they were experts, one would expect that they would hold productive, private sector jobs.  They are government bureaucrats.  Bureaucrats know paperwork.  Hence, the most cited violations by OSHA are paperwork related.  <P>	

Third, the gross budget authority for OSHA was over $298 million in 1994.  Tax dollars spent on federal enforcement and state programs (administering and enforcing state standards) account for 70 percent of OSHA's budget.  As with many of OSHA's other activities, I think this reflects an attitude of confrontation towards rather than cooperation with business.<P>	Even after one notes the many OSHA horror stories, regulations, paperwork burdens, and costs, some still claim that OSHA's benefits outweigh its many costs.  For example, in a May 16, 1995 speech, President Clinton linked OSHA with reduced workplace deaths.  He stated: "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been at work in this cause since it was created with bipartisan support in 1970.  Since that time, workplace deaths have been cut in half."<P>

Of course, workplace deaths were on the decline long before OSHA was created.  Fewer workplace deaths reflect many changes in our economy -- greater automation, shift in employment from manufacturing to services, leaps in technology, enhanced knowledge, et al.  There exists no clear and substantial evidence that OSHA has played any significant role in preventing workplace injuries or death.<P>	

In light of these facts, SBSC supports Representative Cass Ballenger's "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995."  It offers many real, positive OSHA reforms.  In particular, I'd like to note the following:<P>
<ul>
<LI> A Voluntary Compliance Program (VCP) allowing any employer to utilize an approved private-sector safety and health consultant for safety and health reviews.  Participants in the VCP would be exempt from random OSHA inspections for up to one year.  	Such a reform will help to alleviate the problem of lack of expertise among OSHA inspectors.  By essentially contracting out these inspections to the private sector, private firms, including perhaps insurance companies, will have clear incentives to become industry experts, more so than government bureaucrats today.<P>

<LI> An opportunity for an employer to correct alleged safety and health violations before a citation is issued, unless a fatality or serious injury occurred.  With so many OSHA rules and regulations, allowing employers to correct alleged violations before being fined is a fair, much-needed reform.  This reform also should reduce OSHA's own paperwork burden.<P>

<LI> Eliminates penalties for posting and paperwork violations, except where a direct threat of injury or an intent to deceive OSHA exist.  This will considerably rollback OSHA's ability to impose frivolous penalties on employers, saving millions of dollars annually.<P>

<LI> Formally codifies the small business OSHA exemption 
from routine safety inspections, and expands it to firms with  50 or fewer employees that have below average injury rates.<P><LI> Requires the application of cost benefit, risk assessment, and regulatory impact analyses to OSHA regulations.  <P>

<LI> Reserves at least 50 percent of the OSHA budget for consultation, training, education, and compliance assistance programs.  This would be a good first step toward making OSHA a more cooperative federal agency.<P>

<LI> Seeks to apply stricter, non-arbitrary criteria in 
order for OSHA to levy fines in excess of $7,000.<P>

<LI> Requires that employees first go to employers to 
redress workplace problems before approaching OSHA.  Such a measure should greatly reduce frivolous and harassing complaints by employees who are disgruntled or in the midst of a labor dispute.<P>

<LI> Consolidates the Mine Safety and Health Administration with OSHA, and eliminates the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  SBSC is a strong supporter of all efforts to eliminate waste and duplication in government, and to reduce government expenditures.<P>	These OSHA reforms and others included in Representative Ballenger's bill amount to much more than rhetoric about "reinventing" government.  They are real reforms that make for a somewhat saner regulatory regime, and will positively impact U.S. businesses and the economy.
<P>	</ul>
A new regulatory framework is needed in the United States.  One that no longer incorrectly assumes that business owners are merely callous exploiters of labor, but recognizes them as the risk takers, job creators, innovators, and producers they actually are.  If the U.S. economy is to compete and succeed in the twenty-first century, government's heavy hand of over-regulation must be lifted.  Reforming OSHA is a good start which has SBSC's full support.<P>

I thank the Committee, once again, for inviting me here today.  I will be glad to answer any questions you might have, and I offer SBSC's assistance in your efforts to provide for a saner regulatory environment in the United States.<P>

<h3>Replacing the Federal Income Tax</h3>
Ray Tyler<br>
Member<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<br>
& <br>
Owner<br>
Tyler Business Service<p>
                                
Before the <br>
Committee on Ways and Means<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
June 6, 1995<p>
</center>                                
<hr>
<p>

     Good morning Chairman Archer and members of the committee.  My name is Ray Tyler, 
owner of Tyler Business Services located in Washington, D.C.  I am also a member of the Small 
Business Survival Committee, a nationwide, nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy 
organization that fights against the growing burden of taxes and regulations on our nation's
small businesses and entrepreneurs.  Tyler Business Services is a full-service printing shop which
has been operating in the nation's capital for 35 years.<p>

     First, let me thank you Chairman Archer for inviting me to speak before the Ways and 
Means Committee today.  Secondly, I congratulate you for holding these hearings to address
the important issue of overhauling our nation's tax system.  Your leadership in this area is critical to 
not only today's small businesses and entrepreneurs, but also to the well-being of future small 
business owners  who indeed will need this committee's help to increase their chance of
success and survival.<p>

     I say this Chairman Archer, because I have been a small business owner for over 35 years 
and have seen the increased tax and regulatory burden placed on my own business.  The only 
way that I have been able to keep the doors of my business open has been through the paid 
assistance of professionals who specialize in the tax compliance area -- namely a 
Certified Public Accountant (CPA), a full-time bookkeeper, an attorney and bankers.<p>

     Last year my CPA cost the business over $9,000.  At least 10 percent of my 
staff bookkeeper's salary  -- about $4,500 -- is dedicated to dealing with lawyers, bankers and 
IRS issues.  The company pension fund, which I used to manage myself as well as pay 
someone $1,000 to do actuarial work ten years ago, cost me $26,000 last year because of
changes in the way the IRS administers the tax fund.  My billing department also incurs hefty tax code 
compliance costs.  And, of course, my time must be factored into these overall costs as well 
which take away from my productive time actually running the business.    Let me again add that 
these are just compliance costs -- not the actual taxes! <p>

     Today's small businessperson almost always has to pay professionals to navigate 
them through the complicated tax compliance maze.  And, this is a never-ending changing 
maze I might add.  According to the Tax Foundation, over the past forty years (since the
passage of the Internal Revenue Act of 1954 which put the income tax at the center of the federal tax 
system) thirty-one notable tax changes have taken place -- on average, a major change to the 
federal tax code every 1.3 years.  Not surprisingly, the increase of  the size and complexity of
the tax code has caused an increase in my tax compliance costs. <p>
  
     The uncertainty and instability of the tax system, the number of taxes that I must pay, 
combined with my total tax bill, and compliance costs is enough to drive anyone out of business. <p>

I'm not quite sure how a person starting his or her own business can quite make it these days.  
Fortunately my business has grown, and with it have been able to factor in the cost of taxes and 
tax compliance into my overall business costs.  I am almost sure that many business failures
are the direct result of our nation's excessive and burdensome tax system.  The current system
creates disincentives to save, invest and pursue risk-taking, entrepreneurial activity. <p>

     Many, many times in my business I try to do the right thing for my employees by creating 
incentives for them to stay with the business, and while they are with us be more productive 
employees.  When I first created a pension plan for the business (as mentioned above) I used
to manage it, but because of the complexity of the tax laws I had to turn it over to the bankers and 
the lawyers.  Now I just sign the reams of paperwork from the bank, and pay a lot to do simply 
that. <p>
                                
     At the end of each month if the business turns a profit, I also give bonuses to my 
employees.  The government even makes this difficult because I have to "renegotiate" salaries
to comply with misguided regulations.<p>

     The bottom-line to the costly and burdensome tax system is that my employees are hurt 
through lower wages, and my customers are hurt through higher prices.  And my business is
only one example of how the government is depressing our nation's standard of living and hurting 
economic growth and job creation.  <p>

     I, like many other small business owners, agree that something must be done to make our 
tax system less-costly, less-burdensome and more efficient.  That is why Chairman Archer you, 
and other leaders in the Congress who are advocating far-reaching proposals to overhaul the
tax system have certainly won the hearts of many small business owners.  And, although you may 
have won our hearts, lawmakers have not yet won our minds.  Because many small business 
owners believe that the federal government is incapable of making a tax system fair and less-
burdensome.  This is only an honest assessment of how many small business owners feel.  <p>

     However, I remain confident that perhaps this will occur in my lifetime.  By the way, I 
am 75 years-old and would appreciate it if you put these tax overhaul efforts on the
fast-track.<p>

     While at this point in time I do not advocate one tax system over another, I agree with 
some basic principles which have been well presented by the Small Business Survival 
Foundation.  Two leading proposals which "score" high against these principles are a flat tax
and a consumption tax -- or the national sales tax.  The basics of a sound tax system developed by
the Small Business Survival Foundation, and based on Adam Smith's maxims of a taxation in 1776, 
include:<p>
<ul>

<li>          Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>          No Taxation of Capital
<li>          Inflation Factor
<li>          Clarity
<li>          Simplicity
<li>          Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>          Minimum Incentives for Tax Avoidance
<li>          No Additional Boost to Government Spending

</ul>
     I'd like to leave with you Chairman Archer, and I am sure that the Small Business 
Survival Foundation would make this available to all members of the committee, a copy of a 
Preliminary Report prepared by  the organization's chief economist called "The Great Tax 
Debate:  Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans."  This report details each of the above 
principles in greater detail, and how leading proposals score against the basics of a sound tax 
system. <p>

     Once again Chairman Archer I thank you for inviting me to be a part of these important 
hearings today.  While typical Washington observers will say that overhauling the nation's tax 
system is an impossible task that will never happen, I am just thrilled that we have entered a 
political environment where this debate is actually occurring.<p>

     Most hard-working taxpayers agree that something must be done to make the U.S. tax 
code more fair, less-costly and less-burdensome.  For our nation's small business owners, the 
current tax code is a mess and totally out-of-control.  I am so pleased that you are taking a lead
to help reward our nation's risk-takers and job creators which will lead to greater economic 
opportunity and security for all Americans.  I would be more than happy to answer any
questions you or committee members may have.   <p>

<title>"The Flat Tax and Small Business"</title>

<h3>The Flat Tax and Small Business</h3>
Testimony by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
The Small Business Survival Committee<p>
Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance <br>
Committee on Small Business<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
May 18, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

Madam Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the flat income tax and its impact on the small business, entrepreneurial sector of our economy.  My name is Ray Keating, and I am chief economist for the Small Business Survival Committee, a small-business advocacy organization with over 40,000 members across the nation.<p>

As you well know, entrepreneurs drive the economy.  By creating and investing in new businesses, ideas, and innovations, the entrepreneur ensures capitalism's constant renewal and growth.  While government can assist this process by protecting life and limb and guaranteeing property rights, government unfortunately more often than not creates obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic growth.  Perhaps the most formidable of the many governmental obstacles thrown in the path of entrepreneurs during this century has been the U.S. federal income tax code.<p>

	As constituted today,  the federal income tax system amounts to a convoluted mess.  It is complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

	To that end, it should come as no surprise that the great debate on overhauling our nation's tax system is welcomed with open arms by our nation's small business owners.  In fact, according to a recent survey by the Small Business Survival Committee and the Luntz Research Companies, the flat tax is resonating very favorably with the small business, entrepreneurial sector.  When given the specifics of Representative Dick Armey's flat tax plan, 56 percent of respondents from a nationwide survey of 500 small businesses supported the flat tax while 36 percent opposed it.  The intensity of the support is interesting as 25 percent "strongly support" the flat tax while 31 percent "somewhat support" it.  In terms of opposition to the flat tax, 15 percent of small business respondents "somewhat oppose," and 21 percent "strongly oppose" it.<p>  

	While the Small Business Survival Committee does not base its policy positions on surveys and polls, I provide you with these numbers to give the Committee a sense of the support for a flat tax in the business community.  We also found interesting trends in our survey based on business size and geographic location.  The larger the business, the greater was the intensity of support.  In terms of geographic location, businesses in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states were more favorable to a flat tax, while respondents in New England, the Mid-West, rust-belt, and Pacific Coast states registered a greater intensity of opposition.  Please note, however, that across all categories of business size and location, support was strong for a flat tax.<p>

	Let me add again that we outlined the flat tax proposal for each participant -- specifically mentioning which tax write-offs they would lose, and what would not be taxed 
under the Armey plan.<p>

	In the accompanying Small Business Survival Foundation study (each of you should have a copy), I outlined some basic criteria for a sound tax system.  These are: <p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth</b> -- the lower and more proportional, or flatter, the tax rate system the better.  A flat tax is a fair system, as individuals and businesses pay taxes in proportion to the income they earn.  And more importantly, a low, flat tax rate creates far fewer disincentives for working, investing, and risk taking than does a system of steeply progressive tax rates.<p>

<li><b>No Taxation of Capital </b> -- taxing returns on investment and savings makes absolutely no economic sense. Taxes on savings, dividends and capital gains amount to double taxation and are essentially levies on economic growth.<p>

<li><b>Inflation Factor</b> -- the detrimental effects of inflation should be factored into any tax system's design.<p>

<li><b>Clarity</b> -- the clearer the tax system the better.  It should be apparent how much is owed, who is paying, and when the tax is being paid.<p>

<li><b>Simplicity</b> -- tax payments should be made as easy and as simple as possible for the taxpayer without any loss of clarity.  <p>

<li><b>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness</b> -- the fewer tax collectors and the more limited their powers the better.<p>

<li><b>Minimize Incentives for Tax Avoidance</b> -- taxes should be low enough and easy enough to comply with so as to not provide significant incentives for avoidance.<p>

<li><b>No Additional Boost to Government Spending</b> -- a tax system's design should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Our current income tax system scores miserably according to these criteria:<p>
<ul>
<li>Current tax rates are high and progressive -- punishing work, success and the economy.<p>

<li>Capital is taxed, including interest from savings, dividends, and capital gains.  As you know the top capital gains tax rate for individuals stands at 28 percent, and for corporations at 35 percent.<p>

<li>In terms of the inflation factor, the current system is split.  On the positive side, tax rates are indexed so that merely inflationary increases in income no longer push taxpayers into higher tax brackets.  On the negative side, capital gains are not indexed for inflation.  Under such a regime, the <i>real </i>tax rate on capital gains is much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent.  In fact, investors can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses under the current system.  Since one of the major difficulties facing most small businesses is raising capital, high, real capital gains tax rates are particularly detrimental.<p>

<li>Withholding and corporate taxation make the current system quite murky as to who is paying taxes, when, and how much?<p>

<li>As for simplicity, in the accompanying paper I outline just a handful of our current system's many costs and complexities.  Suffice it to say here that I have never met <i>anyone </i>claiming that our current income tax system was simple.<p>

<li>Few, if anyone, also claim that our system allows for a small tax collection bureaucracy or limited government intrusiveness into the private financial affairs of citizens.<p>

<li>The combination of high tax rates and tax law complexities create significant incentives for tax avoidance and evasion.<p>

<li>Finally, the income tax, especially one with high, progressive tax rates, has always acted as high-octane fuel for government spending.<p>
</ul>
<p>
	To the contrary, a low-rate, flat income tax scores very high according to our criteria for a sound tax system.<p>
<ul>
<li>As currently debated, a flat tax system would impose a rate of about 17 percent on all income above a certain level allowed for exemptions.  A 17 percent top tax rate would be the lowest this nation has witnessed since before World War I.  The rewards for working, risk taking, and succeeding would be greatly enhanced.<p>

<li>Capital would not be taxed.  Interest on savings, dividends, and capital gains would not be taxed -- eliminating current double taxation and providing a huge boost to economic growth.  Obviously, incentives for saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would skyrocket, and trillions of dollars would be freed up and made available for investment in new and expanding businesses.<p>

<li>Under a flat-tax-rate scenario with no taxation of capital gains, government possesses few, if any, tax-related reasons to inflate.<p>

<li>If a flat tax eliminates withholding, as Representative Dick Armey's plan would, the true cost of government will become increasingly clear to the average citizen.  Though, by continuing to tax business income, the system would still lack complete clarity, as corporate taxes would be at least partially hidden in the form of lower profits or higher prices.<p>

<li>A low, flat income tax would be vastly simpler than our current system.  Tax compliance costs would plummet.  Resources would be shifted away from tax-related make-work to productive ventures.<p>

<li>As for bureaucracy, the IRS could be greatly downsized as tax complexities evaporate and both individuals and businesses file returns on small index cards.  The potential dangers of government intrusiveness, however, still exist with such an income tax.  The IRS would continue to poke its nose around in the private financial affairs of citizens, but probably to a lessor extent than today.<p>

<li>The combination of a low tax rate and the elimination of deductions and credits, greatly limits incentives for tax avoidance or evasion.<p>

<li>The flat tax would serve as a great improvement over the current system in terms of its impact on government spending.  How so? First, Congress should not only be looking to shift to a flatter tax rate system, but should be looking to provide overall, much-needed tax reduction.  This would assist in limiting spending increases, lowering government's share of GDP, and boosting economic growth.  Second, by ending withholding, the true cost of government will become clearer to taxpayers as they actually sit down and write out a check to the federal government for their tax bill on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Demands for government to economize should drastically increase under such a reform.  Of course, the downside remains that income taxes have always fueled the growth of government, whether at the national, state or local levels -- and the flat tax is still an income tax.<p>
</ul>

Overall, a low-rate, flat income tax would serve as a boon to entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy.  In the short run, there will be a few adjustment pains for some businesses that grew out of various artificial incentives in our current, complex tax code.  But such woes would soon fade away, to be dwarfed by vastly improved incentives for investment and entrepreneurship.  In terms of expanding the pool of available capital, lowering and flattening income tax rates, and tax simplification, make no mistake about it, small business will thrive under such reforms.<p>  

	I would simply add that the lower you can push tax rates the better.  In fact, a flat tax rate of just 10 percent has a nice ring to it.<p>

	Thank you Madam Chairman and Members of the Committee.  On behalf of our small business members nationwide, we appreciate your efforts to study the important issue of tax overhaul.  Both through private conversations with small business owners and surveys, we find that government taxation -- especially federal taxes -- remains the number one concern of business owners.  The Small Business Survival Committee looks forward to working with you and the Committee as you continue to study and hold hearings on the various tax overhaul proposals.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have about my testimony.<p>

<title>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h3>President Clinton's Proposal To Increase the Minimum Wage</h3>
Testimony of Grant Maloy<br>
 Owner Gabriella Growers Oviedo, Florida<p>
Before Joint Economic Committee<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Grant Maloy, owner and operator of Gabriella Growers, a wholesale foliage nursery located near Orlando, Florida. I grow houseplants which are sold throughout the country. I thank the Joint Economic Committee for the opportunity to appear before you today. I think it is vitally important that the United States Congress hear from small business owners and entrepreneurs such as myself, about the impact of proposed government policies on small business. Business owners, like me, are the ones who have to deal with the aftermath of our lawmaker's actions, and I appreciate the Committee giving the small business voice, a voice in this process.<p>

I started my own small business -- it began as a 2,700 square foot greenhouse and today totals 19,000 square feet. One thing that I did not learn in college, was that if you decide to take the plunge into entrepreneurship, the government -will be a roadblock at each stage. The first hurdle starts at the county level, with the last at the federal level. As a small business owner, you face zoning, license, code enforcement, sign restrictions, and fire inspectors from local government. As you move to the state level, worker's compensation, business inspectors, more regulations, fees and taxes. Then, at the federal level there are social security taxes, unemployment taxes, income taxes, OSHA and the list goes on and on.<p>

If it were not for family to help and guide me through the tax and regulatory mazes and hurdles that exist, I probably would have never tried to start a business. And, if I did start one without their help and assistance, there is a good possibility I would have failed. Not because of marketing, sales, or employee problems -- but due to government-imposed barriers.<p>

My business defines what the "small" in small business means. My annual sales totaled $60,000 last year. I began my business from scratch, working parttime at it in 1987, and full-time in 1990. I believe that I represent many ofthe struggling, start-up businesses throughout America.<p>

I oppose an increase in the minimum wage, because it creates just another roadblock for new or expanding small businesses. The market place works, and the academics and bureaucrats in government should stop imposing some artificial wage rate on business, especially when it has been proven that wage tinkering creates additional job loss and hurts those it purportedly is supposed to help.<p>
<h3> <i>The Market Place Works</i></h3>
In my industry, many low-skilled workers are hired. The entry level positions currently pay an average of $5.24 an hour. Competition is strong in the greenhouse industry with wholesale prices remaining nearly the same for over a decade. Yet, wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.<p>

Employees should be paid based on their productivity and worth, not on some theoretic number selected by politicians for political reasons. I remember two years ago when even President Clinton said that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earnings." Now because of political pressure from organized labor, and new attempts to inflict class warfare into his political strategy, the President has flip-flopped on another key issue of his 1992 campaign.<p>

The laws of economics are as strong as the laws of physics. If you try to bend the rules, you will end up with distortions, and often a disaster. If an employee is not going to produce $4.25 or $5.15 per hour, a business can't afford to pay them that. Persons trying to get their start, and jump onto the economic ladder suffer because they will be unemployed and unskilled. If you take a look at the enormous unemployment rate amongst teenagers and inner-city residents, you will see how the setting of arbitrary wage-rates bears this claim out.<p>

Unfortunately, the real losers of a minimum wage hike will be the individuals whose skills do not allow them to compete successfully for the entry level job.<p>

<h3><i>Hypocrisy of Government Policies</i></h3>

Another reason I am opposed to the minimum wage is due to the fact that it is a hypocritical policy. The government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, when the business owner themselves may not make minimum wage.<p>

When I started my business, I was making about $2.00 per hour. I am not complaining because I was sacrificing to pay off a business loan and I was investing in my future. I enjoyed, and still do, the challenge of creating a business and future for myself.<p>

In essence, the minimum wage is just another unfunded mandate from Washington. The President or Congress sets the policy, and then passes the buck. In this case, hard-working small business owner are left to handle the problem.<p>

<h3><i>Government Micro-management</i></h3>

How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay? Economic decisions and business productivity varies from region to region, city to city, etc. It is ludicrous for the government to think it knows what is best for everyone. If this system did work, Congress should raise the minimum wage to $50 per hour, and poverty, presumably,
 would be solved.<p>

Already, government taxes and regulations at all levels cost my business plenty. If I want to expand my business, which I intend to do, and need the help to do it -- I will find less expensive ways to get the work done since I may not be able to afford a new employee at the new wage rate. Increasingly the government is setting up more hurdles to create jobs in this country. On the one hand small businesses have been lamented by the Administration for not doing enough (paying enough, providing health care, etc.) for our employees. At the same time, they are discouraging us, because of proposed policies like the minimum wage hike, to actually employ people.<p>

<h3><i>The Real Problem and Real Solutions</i></h3>

The government's goal should be to protect free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Rather than punish business and success, the government should ask..."How do we increase economic prosperity for all businesses and all workers?"<p>

Prosperity will only increase if Congress removes government-imposed hurdles that are strangling small business and entrepreneurship. If you really want to help small business owners like me the answers are simple: cut taxes, reduce regulations and praise entrepreneurship. Don't bash business.
 Finally, the government can encourage strong families. When I think backto what helped me the most on the road to entrepreneurship, it was not the government or school. It was the experience I received working for my dad's small business, and the encouragement and support
 that my parents gave me.<p>

I do not need more government-imposed rules or regulations on my small business. The government's role should be to protect, preserve and enhance small business. The proposed minimum wage hike flies in the face of these three principles, as well as the message that all Americans are sending government -that it spends, taxes, regulates and meddles too much.<p>

I urge the U.S. Congress to let the minimum wage proposal just remain that -- a proposal. The minimum wage's days have long been numbered, and breathing life into this misguided proposal would not only be bad for small businesses like Gabriella Growers, but bad for the current and future workers of America as well.<p>

Once again I thank the Committee and look forward to answering any questions you may have.<p>

Capital Gains Taxes and the Investment Impact on Small Business

<h3>Capital Gains Taxes and the Investment Impact on Small Business</h3>

Richard W. Rahn, Ph.D.<br>
Member of the Board<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>
                              
Before the <br>
 Committee on Small Business<br>
 United States House of Representatives<br>
 February 22, 1995<p>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

     
     Chairman Meyers, members of the Committee, I thank the Small Business
Committee for inviting me to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     I am Richard Rahn, and I am a board member of the Small Business Survival
Committee (SBSC), a 40,000-member nonpartisan, nonprofit, small business advocacy
organization.  I formally served as Vice President and Chief Economist for the United
States Chamber of Commerce, and currently serve as President of Novecon.<p>

     If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream,
it is owning your own business.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and
entrepreneurs cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as
government-imposed -- namely, taxes and regulations.  The government has become the
main deterrent to small business prosperity and entrepreneurial activity, and I am
encouraged that the 104th Congress is taking proactive steps to lift burdensome policies
and requirements which are stifling economic growth and productivity.<p>

         If enacted, a capital gains tax cut will help to relieve a formidable obstacle faced
by American business -- especially small business.   While I fully support the elimination
of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation as proposed in the Contract With
America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying
jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business
expansions.<p>
  
     The United States is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business
sector for its job creating capabilities and technological and innovative breakthroughs. 
The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship, punishing and
discouraging these activities.  It is clear that the U.S. tax policies toward savings and
investment must be revised if we are to retain our country's leading economic role, as
well as retain the necessary status and clout to manage and provide leadership on all
world affair issues.<p>
                                
                                
       <h3>Small Business Investment and Capital Gains Taxes<br>
            Impediment of an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Too often, risk-takers and entrepreneurs with their promising ideas face a
daunting obstacle in launching a new business -- raising capital.  Business owners with
profitable, growing companies can also hit a brick wall when seeking funding sources to
expand their operations.  The U.S. tax code in its treatment of capital gains, is a major
barrier for such small business owners or emerging entrepreneurs. <p>

     The nation's economic future depends on the success of the entrepreneurial sector. 
Small business is our nation's job-creating machine.  Investment in small business is
critical to our nation.   While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the
Contract With America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top
capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new
Congress.      <p>

     Unfortunately, investment spending in the United States has largely continued on a
downward path over the past 30 to 40 years.  According to a 1994 study by  the American
Council for Capital Formation Center for Policy Research, net annual business investment
in the U.S. has in recent years fallen to only half the level of the 1960s and 1970s.  Net
private domestic investment, according to the same study, averaged 7.4 percent of GDP
from 1960 to 1980.  Since 1991 it has averaged only 3.0 percent.<p>

     Lower investment spending in the U.S. renders less risk-taking and innovation,
diminished productivity, fewer job-creating opportunities and, overall, weakened
economic growth. <p>


     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in
new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off
bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and
friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for
entrepreneurial enterprises.  Such investors must determine if they will receive a fair
return on their investment.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship. 
Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the
engines of economic growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate
of 28 percent on capital gains remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion,
especially considering the risky nature of investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear, and
they will largely benefit small business.  According to the American Council for Capital
Formation, venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate
declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in
1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital
gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital investment has nose-dived, and federal
capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well below government expectations.  (In
fact,  according to CATO Institute economist Steve Moore, 1991 revenue realizations
equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269
billion and a Joint Economic Committee prediction of $285 billion.)<p>

     Higher capital gains rates discourage  savings and investment, raising the cost of
available capital.   The effect of higher capital costs means lower levels of investment in
plant and equipment, technology and labor.  As a result, it costs more to produce goods
and services, resulting in higher consumer prices.  Already economies of scale make it
more difficult for small businesses to compete with larger competitors.  The higher cost
of capital, and its resulting inefficiencies, impacts small businesses much more harshly.<p>

     Low capital gains taxes will help lower the cost of capital.  Researchers have
found that a cut in the capital gains tax rate to a range of 15 to 20 percent would reduce
the cost of capital by 4 to 8 percent.   <p>

   <h3>  Indexation of Capital</h3>

     The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is
factored into the capital gains equation the real capital gains tax rate rises substantially. 
The willingness to invest is substantially hindered by taxing capital gains, which are
"specter" earnings spurred by inflation.  <p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some
individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring
inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss,
yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Or put more simply, individuals
still pay a substantial capital gains tax even though, after inflation, they receive less from
their sale than they originally paid.  From a "fairness" perspective this is unfair and makes
no economic sense. <p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to
investment, while real rates to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to
economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate
would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     A Capital Gains Tax Cut and the Fairness Issue </h3>

      Opponents who dismiss lowering and/or eliminating capital gains tax rates are
employing class warfare tactics which are based on false assumptions, and make no
economic sense.   Opponents of cutting capital gains taxes contend that this will result in
a cash windfall to the nation's richest while the poor will continue to suffer.  Not only
does reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make economic sense, but capital gains
tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe (or want to believe.)<p>

     Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital
gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent
of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than $100,000.<p>

     The precept behind the opposition to a cut in the capital gains tax, is a false belief
in the static nature of our economy and a "black and white" view of the world -- if one
individual wins, then someone else has to lose.   A cut in the capital gains tax will benefit
all investors, and all income classes alike -- rich, middle-class, and lower middle-class --
because it would improve the economy's performance and growth potential.<p>

       Hard-working individuals and entrepreneurs who save and invest their money
wisely are unfairly being punished for that activity.  When high capital gains taxes punish
investors of all income classes by gorging the value of their investments, or watering
them down through the taxation of inflated gains, the response is to consume more now
and  to save and invest less.  Government-imposed barriers to saving and investing hurts
the economy and everyone in it.  The siphoning of productive resources into the
unproductive and wasteful stream of government spending, is what can really be termed
as unfair.<p>

     Governor Lawrence  B. Lindsey, of the Federal Reserve, wrapped up the class
warfare and fairness issue quite directly in a March 20, 1990 Op-Ed in the Washington
Post entitled "Envy is No Basis for Tax Policy":<p>

     The political manipulation of envy is one reason why America has seen its
competitive position in the world economy gradually erode during much of the postwar
period.  There may have been a time when America could afford to waste its resources in
the name of envy, but that is a luxury we can no longer afford. ...The losers from the
pursuit of envy are not only today's wealthy but everyone who benefits from a strong
American economy, both today and in the future.<p>

     If the proponents of higher capital gains taxes were really interested in fairness
they would insist that all losses be deductible in the way that all gains are taxed.  It is
hypocrisy to argue that we need high capital gains taxes for fairness, and then to argue for
limitations on losses.<p>

<h3>     Targeted Capital Gains Tax Cuts</h3>

      Small business, and entrepreneurial activity in general, will benefit from an
across-the-board cut in the capital gains tax.  Targeting a capital gains tax cut to certain
industries assumes that politicians and bureaucrats in Washington can better pick winners
and losers in the marketplace rather than the competitive economy can.  Neither specific
industries, nor smaller versus larger industries, should be "targeted" for the cut.<p>

     In addition to the misguided assumption that the government can and should 
choose what industries should be given favorable tax treatment, the government is further
complicating an already mystifying and convoluted U.S. tax system.  American taxpayers
and most businesses are asking for a less-costly, less-complicated tax system -- not one
that exacerbates its current complexity.<p>

     If a "targeted" approach is enacted, capital may indeed begin to flow to certain
industries, but high capital gains taxes would continue to "lock-in" investors and keep
capital from flowing to its most productive uses.  Increasing the mobility of capital is
important to free investors to pursue all their investment opportunities, not those hand-picked by
the government.  Investment decisions should be based on their merit, not on
U.S. tax policy.<p>

     Targeting a capital gains cut also presents the problem of further politicizing the
U.S. tax code.  Industries from across America will be lobbying Congress for their own
favorable capital gains tax rate to attract investment.  <p>

     The capital gains tax cut in the Contract With America is precisely the type of cut
that the U.S. Congress should enact.     <p>

<h3>     The "Cost-Effectiveness" of the Capital Gains Tax Cut</h3>

     The Committee asked me to comment on the cost-effectiveness of the capital gains
tax cut.  This question assumes that there will be a major "cost" to the federal government
in terms of tax revenues if a capital gains tax cut is enacted -- nothing can be further from
reality.  The question should be, what is the cost to the federal government (in terms of
revenue foregone), and the economy when high capital gains taxes become U.S. tax
policy?<p>

      There is no question that changes in tax rates affect how hard and long people
work and how much they save and invest.  The official revenue-estimating arms of the
government in part ignore how tax policy changes human behavior in making these
calculations.  Indeed, at the heart of the debate in Washington right now is whether
revenue estimators should employ static versus dynamic scoring to determine how much
the Contract's tax cuts will "cost."  This argument is important because static scoring has
created a bias in favor of tax increases and against tax cuts.<p>

     All we need to do is to look at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and their
track record in revenue estimating to show that indeed, when capital gains tax rates
increased, the CBO failed in its attempt to accurately estimate government revenues. 
When the capital gains tax rate was raised from 20 to 28 percent in 1986, the CBO
forecast that taxable capital gains would rise to $225 billion by 1989.  The actual figure
was $150 billion -- a miscalculation of about 50 percent or $75 billion.<p>

     Between 1988 and 1991, taxable capital gains fell below the 1985 level in every
single year.  By 1991 they were just half of what they were in 1985 (after adjusting for
inflation) and lower than in any year since 1978.  Incredibly, as late as 1988 the CBO was
claiming that its computer simulations showed a "net revenue increase from the 1986
ACT."<p>

     In January of 1990, the CBO again miscalculated its capital gains revenue.  They
estimated that the government would realize $269 billion for 1991.  They missed the
mark by about 150 percent, as the capital gains realization was $108 billion.<p>

     Experience demonstrates that lower capital gains taxes have a beneficial impact on
federal revenues.  If we look at recent t history, the evidence is indisputable.  During the
period of 1978 to 1985 the marginal federal tax rate on capital gains was cut from almost
50 percent to 20 percent.  Total individual capital gains tax receipts increased from $9.1
billion to $26.5 billion.  Capital gains realization swelled to $326 billion in 1986, and
have trended downward ever since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased rates.<p>

     In addition to the fact that the federal treasury will gain from a capital gains tax
cut, as noted earlier in my testimony, the entire economy will gain as well.  Freeing
capital to go to its most productive uses, and making capital available to new and growing
businesses far outweighs any so-called "cost" to the federal government.  Not only is
cutting the capital gains tax the most cost-effective jobs program the government can
enact, it will help the United States rapidly regain its competitive edge in the global
economy.  <p>

    <h3> How U.S. Capital Gains Tax Rates Compete Internationally</h3>

     Higher capital gains tax rates undermine our nation's competitiveness while
challenging our status as world economic leader.  The current non-indexed capital gains
tax rate is not competitive internationally.  <p>

     Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate on long-term
capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the U.S.,
with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the
United Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S.
real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending
on U.S. inflation.<p>

     Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains
should be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that
entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the
U.S. federal tax code.  The fact is the capital gains tax is a double or triple tax because
the income has been taxed at least once before, and in the case of corporate stock, twice
before.  The steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital
gains tax rate is a good start.<p>

     
<h3>     Urban and Inner-City Renewal</h3>

     Renewing our inner-cities requires a comprehensive policy approach to resolve the
decay and dysfunction so prevalent in these areas.  In addition to reforming federal tax
and welfare policies that impact inner-city residents, states and cities must also take a
very hard look at their current tax policies, regulatory structures, as well as spending
priorities and inefficiencies to determine how such polices impact job flight and an anti-business
climate.<p>

     However, a capital gains tax cut will indeed free up capital to new and emerging
businesses, many of which do start up in our nation's inner-cities.  As with many new
businesses, fledgling start-ups will be helped by greater access to capital.  Capital is
scarce for most small businesses and entrepreneurs and, as mentioned, a cut in the capital
gains tax will benefit all income classes in all areas.<p>

    <h3> Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

      Opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason
exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest
income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and
capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments,
which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even
interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant
risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for
rewards.<p>

     Another unfairness of the capital gains tax is that the government fully taxes, but severely
limits losses.  This discourages investors from engaging in high risk investments which are often
the most productive.
     
     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains Taxes</h3>

     Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to
undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital,
new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature
death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress
and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and
entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share
of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working,
saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs
were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and
corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase
in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax
hike in the form of reduced venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and
indexing, and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

     Once again I thank the Committee, and look forward to answering any questions you may
have.<p>

<title>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</title>

<h3>Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act</h3>
Testimony of Karen Kerrigan, President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections <br>
Committee on 
Economic and Educational Opportunities <br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
February 15, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) a 40,000-member nonprofit, nonpartisan small business, grassroots advocacy organization SBSC is also a member of the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, a diverse coalition of national business associations, state and local governments and citizens groups who share the belief that the Davis-Bacon Act is long overdue for repeal.<p>

SBSC, as well as the Coalition to Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act thank you, Chairman Ballenger, and the Committee for your leadership in holding hearings on this most important issue. For years, hard-working small business owners and lower-income Americans searching for opportunities to jump on the economic ladder have been denied that access in the construction industry due to government-sponsored special interest protectionism. The Davis-Bacon Act fosters the most egregious of distortions, and we appreciate being a part of this forum today to discuss how to alleviate the economic and fiscal damage promoted by the Act, while giving more Americans -- especially within our inner-cities -- a greater chance to take that initial step on the economic ladder.<p>

Imagine for a moment, the following question on a national voter referendum, especially during the past campaign cycle:<p>

Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims racist origins; increases cost to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?<p>

The answer, of course, would be a resounding "yes." The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore should be repealed.<p>

Passing the Davis-Bacon Act was wrong in 1931 , and keeping it as law is wrong today. New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>

By now, most politicians cannot claim ignorance of the racist origins of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. The law was introduced and passed to block wage
 competition from black construction workers following an Alabama contractor's successful bid on a federal construction project on New York's Long Island in 1927. The southern contractor employed black construction workers and successfully underbid the local union contractor.<p>

Congressional supporters of the legislation at the time eagerly supported the Act's racial leanings. A through the <i>Congressional Record</i> of 1931 makes this clear. For example, Rep. Clayton Allgood spoke of "cheap colored labor" that is in "competition with white labor throughout the country." Another DavisBacon supporter Rep. John J. Cochran of Missouri said: "I have received numerous cornplaints in recent months about southern contractors employing lowpaid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the south." Similar references were made by other lawmakers as well.<p>

Just as was the case in 1931, low income earners, especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act. Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity, as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such individuals. In particular, small businesses in inner-cities which are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage," usually the union rate, be paid on all federally-funded construction projects. Governmentdetermined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area. Many small contractors cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates, and are thus shut out of federally-funded 
construction projects.<p>

In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts. The "prevailing wage" determination relies heavily on union collective bargaining agreements within a locality. Surveys are rarely conducted, and a "locality" can often mean an enormous geographic region. University of Chicago economist Yale Brozen found the "prevailing wage" for the Appalachian region of Western Pennsylvania set at the same level as Pittsburgh, a city known for its high concentration of union workers.<p>

 Inflated wage rates and rigid job classifications, along with complex and voluminous paperwork requirements demand that firms become less-efficient in order to compete
 for Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

The paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors. In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed, requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or the contracting agency on a <u>weeklv</u> basis. These weekly certified payroll reports alone cost employers on Davis-Bacon contracts in excess of $100 million per year. The Copeland Act requirement forces many contractors to hire additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules. The result: higher costs that discourage or exclude small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>

Minority and women-owned businesses, which predominate among small construction firms, are especially hurt. This is seen most clearly in the innercities, where a large proportion of federal construction dollars is concentrated. In addition, large non-local construction firms that specialize in Davis-Bacon projects undercut small local contractors. Minority and independent contractors cannot compete, due to the inherent inefficiencies and regulatory burdens associated with Davis-Bacon.<p>

Part of the original intent of Davis-Bacon was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region. But the actual effect is often to protect outside union labor from competition from local, but non-union, workers. On Davis-Bacon projects you will often find out-of-town union journeymen performing work that could easily be done by local non-union workers.<p>

With small and minority contractors shut out from bidding on federal construction projects, minorities in the inner-cities are shut out from job opportunities as well. If contractors are forced to pay one "prevailing wage" they will always chose the already skilled worker, restricting availability for job opportunities. Often, many unemployed individuals are prevented from working on projects in their own neighborhood.<p>

 Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al. The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distort the marketplace, artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and higher-paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers, regardless of job criteria.<p>

Lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages mean higher costs for taxpayers and the economy. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1994, if Davis-Bacon were repealed federal taxpayers would conservatively save $3.1 billion over the following five years. Allowing the use of helpers, or semi-skilled workers would save an additional $500 million a year, bringing total savings from repeal to nearly $6 billion over five years. The Davis-Bacon Act inflates the cost of federal construction by an average of 5 percent to 15 percent. And, the GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.<p>

Local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent. Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

From a fiscal accountability perspective, as well as a moral one, there remains no sound reason to hold onto this legislative relic from the past. At a time when American taxpayers are demanding less and more efficient government, nothing more fully symbolizes a wasteful, meddling Washington than the Davis-Bacon Act. Symbolically and substantively, Davis-Bacon represents the distorted outcome of special interest protectionism. And, most pathetically, its original intent of preventing those who wish to jump on the economic ladder continues to this day.<p>

From a small business perspective, Davis-Bacon makes it impossible for union-free, efficient contractors to bid on federally-funded construction projects. We urge all members of Congress to further unleash the entrepreneurial spirit in every corner of America by repealing the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act.<p>

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.<p>

<h3>Savings and Investment Provisions in the Contract With America</h3>
Karen Kerrigan<br>
President<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<p>

Before the <br>
Committee on Ways and Means<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
January 24, 1995
</center>
</p>
<hr>
<p>     
     Chairman Archer, I would like to thank the Ways and Means Committee for inviting the
Small Business Survival Committee to testify before you today on the future of small business in
America, and how the new Congress and the Administration  can begin to further unleash
investment and entrepreneurship in America to sustain long term economic growth and
opportunity.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) is a 40,000-member nonpartisan,
nonprofit advocacy organization fighting against the growing burden of taxation and regulation
on American small business and individuals. Members of SBSC represent a diversity of small
businesses and enterprises across America.  From home-based businesses, to traditional "mom
and pop" businesses, to small manufacturers, to 1995 entrepreneurs and others -- SBSC's
membership is as diverse as the small business sector itself.<p>

     <i>If there is anything in America that represents attainment of the American Dream, it
is owning your own business</i>.  Unfortunately, most small business owners and entrepreneurs
cite their most daunting day-to-day obstacles of running their business as government-imposed --
namely, taxes and regulations.  We hear little about traditional business-related hurdles regarding
sales, marketing, motivating employees, or topics that also require tremendous time and
resources from the owner.  Government has become the main obstacle to small business
prosperity, and not surprisingly more and more Americans do not view their government as
protector of our great free enterprise system.<p>

         Beyond the twin burdens of taxes and regulations which are slowly strangling
productive entrepreneurial activity, the United States non-indexed capital gains tax creates
another impediment for entrepreneurs wishing to start-up or expand an enterprise.  The federal
government needs to encourage, not punish, private-sector investment. <p>

<h3>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h3>

      Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major
obstacle -- raising capital.  Encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs
to be enhanced.  While SBSC fully supports eliminating the capital gains tax, the Contract With
America proposal which, combined with indexation, reduces the top capital gains tax rate to
19.8 percent, could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.      <p>

     There is no more important economic task than investing both sweat and capital in new
ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet the risky nature of such ventures scares off bank lending
officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from
professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

     The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and entrepreneurship.  Investment and
entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy and remain the engines of economic
growth and job creation.  The current, non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on capital gains
remains a formidable obstacle to economic expansion, especially considering the risky nature of
investing, and starting and operating a business.<p>

     The potential benefits of reducing and indexing the capital gains tax are clear.  Venture
capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed
by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent. 
Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act raised the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent, venture capital
investment has nose-dived, and federal capital gains tax revenues have consistently run well
below government expectations.  In fact,  according to CATO economist Steve Moore, 1991
revenue realizations (most recent available) equaled $108 billion versus a late-1980's
Congressional Budget Office prediction of $269 billion and a Joint Economic Committee
prediction of $285 billion.<p>

<h3>How the U.S. Stacks Up Internationally </h3>

 In the new global economy, it is imperative that the United States be competitive with other nation's on the capital gains front -- the U.S.needs to be a haven and magnet for capital.  The current non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not
competitive internationally.  Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong the Netherlands all have a zero rate
on long-term capital gains.  Canada, France, Italy and Sweden have lower capital gains than the
U.S., with Japan's rate equalling 1 percent of sales price or 20 percent of net capital gain.  Even
the two nation's with higher nominal rates than the United States  --  Australia and the United
Kingdom -- allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains
tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.       
<p>

    <i> Given the critical and risky nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and the
importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should
be excluded altogether.  A zero capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk
taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.  The
steps taken in the Contract With America to reduce and index the capital gains tax rate is a good
start.</i><p>

   <h3>  Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation is 28 percent.  However, when
inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.<p>

     The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and
entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals
can wind up paying taxes on real capital losses.  That is, after factoring inflation into the
equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still
pays taxes on the nominal gains.  Real rates of capital gains taxation represent severe
impediments to keeping America's economy vibrant and growing.<p>

     Figure 1 below offers an example of how inflation can impact capital gains tax rates. 
Listed below are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year
investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  (It is assumed that the investment is
closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate to an
investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.)<p>

     A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment,
while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital
loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital
gains determination -- equalizing state and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would
reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.
     <p>

<h3>     Who Benefits?</h3>

  Opponents who engage in class warfare rhetoric to dismiss lowering and
eliminating capital gains tax rates are employing tactics which the American public, quite 
frankly, is sick of hearing.  "Soak-the-rich" schemes and "fair-share" arguments will continue to
backfire on those who feel they can defeat the issue on these divisive grounds.  Not only does
reducing/eliminating the capital gains tax make sense, but capital gains tend to be spread across a
wider income spectrum than many believe.  Based on 1992 federal income tax returns, 56
percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the
capital gain.  Fully, 83 percent of returns with capital gains were from total incomes of less than
$100,000.<p>

     <h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains </h3>

In addition to false assumptions about the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains
and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

     In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital
gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to
carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular,
investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk
ventures must at least present the opportunity for rewards.<p>

     <h3>Conclusion on Capital Gains</h3>

 Small business is the engine of economic growth and
job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without
adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a
premature death.  With such deaths go products, services and jobs.  By taking the first step in the
Contract With America, and indexing and reducing the capital gains tax rate, Congress and the
Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship --
boosting economic growth and activity.       <p>

     History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact,
during the 1980's, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total
income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and
investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created.<p>

     The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax
rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains
tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form of reduced
venture capital investment.<p>

     The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by first reducing and indexing,
and then eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

 <h3>   Entrepreneurial Incentives in the Contract With America</h3>

      As noted extensively in addressing the importance of reducing, eliminating and indexing
the capital gains tax, individuals respond to tax and savings incentives having a profound impact
on robust and sustained economic growth.  Policy makers need also to look a the changing
nature of the economy.  Home-based businesses, for example, are booming.  Clarifying the
deduction for home-offices recognizes our changing work force while reducing questions
regarding who qualifies and who does not.<p>

     Increasing the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 helps small businesses
pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation -- the U.S. tax code should not penalize
families for wanting to keep a business in the family.<p>

     The small business expensing provision in the Contract encourages investment by
allowing small businesses to deduct the first $25,000 in equipment and inventory.  All of the
above are good steps to help "prime the pump" for small business growth.<p>

     The U.S. tax code needs to encourage savings in America -- increased savings provides
more capital for investment in small businesses and the future of America.  The American Dream
Savings Account provision in the Contract  permits individuals to contribute up to $2,000 into a
special savings account.  Promoting savings in America will strengthen our country's economic
base and encourage savings.<p>

     Small business, and the entrepreneurial spirit that drives America, continues to be a
constant in our economy -- past, present and future.  The U.S. government, whose job it is to
protect and preserve America's free enterprise system, has unfortunately become a foe of the
private sector.  Reforming the tax system so businesses and individuals make decisions on
economic merit rather than tax law is an essential component of free enterprise.<p>

     The Small Business Survival Committee salutes the 104th Congress and the Ways and
Means Committee for its leadership in not only determining how the government can further
encourage savings and investment, but also for beginning to look at America's tax system in its
entirety and how the government can efficiently and fairly collect taxes from its citizens without
eroding individual freedom, or America's free enterprise system.<p>

<h2>
Carolan &amp; Keating &#173;&#173 - December 16, 1996<BR>
Stunning Account of the Great Villain<BR>
<P></h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<p>
<br><blockquote>

Have you ever wondered what Nelson Rockefeller did before he wrecked
New York's economy?  Well, author Cary Reich provides all of the
answers in his new book The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds
to Conquer 1908&#173;1958.
<P>
This biography of the former New York governor and vice president
of the United States deservedly rated as a National Book Award
finalist.  Indeed, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller is crisply
written and well researched.  
<P>
While a massive tome at almost 800 pages, it is just the first
of a two&#173;part work.  In fact, before cracking the book open,
we were a bit leery with the idea of dedicating so much paper
to someone like Rockefeller &#173;&#173; our least favorite governor
of New York (with Mario Cuomo naturally running a very close next&#173;to&#173;last).
 However, now we cannot wait until the second volume lands in
book stores next year.
<P>
This book covers Rockefeller's life up to the point when he handily
won the 1958 New York gubernatorial contest.  So we must wait
for part two to read about how Rockefeller &#173;&#173; through
a massive expansion of state government, myriad borrowing shenanigans,
and destructive tax increases &#173;&#173; set New York firmly
on the track to economic oblivion.  In the meantime, one requires
a host of valuable insights about Rockefeller's pre&#173;Albany
days.  
<P>
The reader gains a portrait of an individual with boundless energy,
enthusiasm and wealth.  Far too often, though, Rockefeller's enthusiasms
clouded his judgment.  Perhaps this proved most obvious while
serving in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  
<P>
FDR tapped Rockefeller's expertise on Latin America, with Rockefeller
eventually serving as an assistant secretary of state.  During
these years, Rockefeller became completely obsessed with establishing
close ties and a united front among all the nations of the Americas
&#173;&#173; not terribly controversial on the face of it, except
for the fact that Rockefeller was more than willing to overlook
Argentina's pro&#173;Nazi regime.  Rockefeller almost appeared
as an appeaser when it came to Argentina.  As the war came to
an end, Rockefeller and the U.S. administration received much
deserved criticism for their less&#173;than&#173;tough stance
toward Argentina.
<P>
Another controversial enthusiasm of Rockefeller's was given birth
while serving under FDR.  He discovered the off&#173;budget government
corporation, and modified it so that these entities were accountable
to no one but himself and FDR, who simply received an annual report.
 
<P>
Years later, after he became governor of New York, Rockefeller
set up dozens of off&#173;budget public corporations, or authorities,
in order to avoid state constitutional limits on borrowing, namely,
voter approval of long&#173;term state debt.  Reich reveals that
as a student at Dartmouth, Rockefeller was interested in the pyramids.
 The government corporation allowed him to finance grand government
building projects &#173;&#173; as useless and almost as massive
as the pyramids.
<P>
Still, even though he enthusiastically sold foreign aid as a cure
for what ailed Latin America, prior to his reign as New York's
governor, Rockefeller's enthusiasms for big government remained
at least somewhat camouflaged.  Indeed, when necessary Rockefeller
could offer arguments and speeches on capitalism so moving that
they probably brought a tear to the eye of Milton Friedman.  However,
practically all of Rockefeller's actions while serving in government
showed him to be a hard&#173;left New Dealer at heart.  Rockefeller
may have spoken glowingly of the marketplace on occasion, but
he believed in the power of government action.  
<P>
Rockefeller was a disciple of his fellow New Yorker FDR.  As Reich
puts it: &quot;Roosevelt was a mentor, an adviser, and a role
model.&quot;  One might be able to forgive FDR for his big&#173;government
escapades, having been knocked silly by the Great Depression.
 Rockefeller had no such excuse years later in New York.
<P>
New York conservatives proved prescient.  As Reich notes, conservative
Republicans always eyed Rockefeller leerily, and as it turned
out for good reason.  But for all the damage wrought by Rockefeller,
the rise of conservatism in the 1960s owed much to him.  While
Ronald Reagan would provide conservatives with something to be
for, Rockefeller gave them something to be against.  
<P>
Reich notes this fact: &quot;Indeed, it would be fair to say that
conservatism would not have advanced so relentlessly had it not
been for Nelson Rockefeller.  In Bill Rusher's words, 'Every movement
needs a villain.  For the GOP right, Nelson Rockefeller was it.'
...  Hatred of Nelson Rockefeller, for the right, became a uniquely
binding force.  The final mordant irony of Rockefeller's life
in politics is this: while he never achieved the Age of Rockefeller,
he may well have brought about the Age of Reagan.&quot;  
<P>
Conservative hatred of Rockefeller lives on, but it is a healthy,
well&#173;warranted hatred.  Get labeled a Rockefeller Republican
and your chances for advancement in today's GOP (outside of New
York, that is) are probably quite slim.  C&amp;K heartily recommend
The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller as a last minute Christmas present.
 It pays to know thy enemy.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 9, 1996<br>
Poor Over&#173;Worked and Under&#173;Paid State Legislators<BR>
<p>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

Many of us apparently don't realize how grueling the job of a
New York state legislator really can be.  In recent weeks, some
legislators are telling anyone who will listen how &quot;stressful&quot;
and &quot;hectic&quot; their jobs are.  They pat themselves on
the back, and declare that they all &quot;work hard.&quot;  And
because they slave so arduously, these public servants plan to
give themselves a pay raise.
<P>
How reassuring.  We must have been deluded to think legislators
are lavishly compensated, while their efforts are wasteful and
incompetent.  
<P>
For example, it costs a little more than $1 million per office
to run the state senate and more than $500,000 per office for
the assembly.  These not insubstantial amounts pay for large staffs,
cars, public relations apparatuses, multiple offices, et al. 
Indeed, the New York state legislature employs more than 4,000
bureaucrats.  It must be very time consuming for legislators to
manipulate all these resources so that taxpayers fail to detect
the utter waste involved.  
<P>
And then, of course, there's all that pandering to whiners and
special interests.  Assemblyman Tony Seminerio of Queens reportedly
said he deserves a pay raise because he puts &quot;a lot of time
in&quot; and has &quot;a lot of responsibility.&quot;  Seminerio
was recently quoted: &quot;It's a quarter after five and I'm still
here.  I'm waiting for a constituent, who will probably be here
at 20 to six.  Tonight I have two meetings to go to.&quot;  How
does tired Tony do it?  After all, none of the rest of us have
ever worked all the way to 6:00 pm, and then had work commitments
later in the evening, right?  In addition, most of those evening
&quot;meetings&quot; for elected officials involve cocktails,
appetizers, dinner, and meeting people who will fill their campaign
coffers.  It must be brutal.  
<P>
One has to wonder why tired Tony and other complainers in the
state legislature don't flee the extreme pressures and low pay
of elected office and get a cushy private sector job.  Why come
back election after election, if things are so tough?  Instead,
they could do something real easy, like start a business; produce
a service or product people actually want; wrestle with onerous
state taxes, regulations and bureaucrats; and only work 18 hours
a day for six or seven days a week.  
<P>
Interestingly, some state legislators actually do have their own
businesses &#173;&#173; that is, if you can call being a law partner
having a business.  Wow, Superman stand aside!
<P>
These poor gals and guys in the legislature have not gotten a
raise since 1989.  Golly, how can they keep up with the rising
cost of living?  We suppose the fact that the job of state legislator
is a part&#173;time position is to be ignored.  Also, that New
York state legislators are the second highest paid in the nation,
only recently surpassed by California, must be set aside.  Additional
lulus (i.e., stipends) for most legislators, worth anywhere from
$6,500 up to $30,000 annually, awarded for doing their jobs and
staying in line politically, cannot be considered.  Expense reimbursements
for being in Albany, worth just under $100 per day on average,
must be pooh&#173;poohed as well.  
<P>
In addition, we should turn a deaf ear to an increase in state
legislator's base bay from $32,960 in 1984 to $57,500 today &#173;&#173;
when adjusted for inflation, a better than 15 percent increase.
 Add in the aforementioned lulus, and the average part&#173;time
state legislator garners about $70,000 per year.
<P>
Lastly, we assume that no link between pay and productivity should
be made at all.  Little lapses in job performance should be overlooked,
like chronically late budgets; high taxes; bloated, inefficient
and wasteful government; over&#173;regulation; state debt gimmicks,
led by off&#173;budget public authorities, designed to skirt the
State Constitution; and a government patronage mill.
<P>
If we ignore all these many factors, then New York state legislators
deserve a pay raise.  However, if we cannot overlook such lapses
&#173;&#173; for both ethical and economic reasons &#173;&#173;
then New York legislators deserve a massive pay cut.
<P>
Perhaps the time has come for serious reforms that will make the
New York state legislature a citizens' body, rather than a body
of lifetime politicians.  The framers of the State Constitution
had such a notion in mind when they required that a legislature
could not vote a pay raise for itself.  A pay raise can only take
effect for the next legislature.  Today, however, the next legislature
is largely the same as the current and previous legislatures.
<P>
Two reforms are needed.  First, require that all pay raises in
the state of New York, whether for state or any local elected
officials, pass muster with the voters before being implemented.
 Second, institute term limits in New York.  Eight years for both
legislators and the governor &#173;&#173; and why not local officials
as well &#173;&#173;  should be sufficient.
<P>
Not only would New York gain a true citizens' legislature, but
poor Tony Seminerio and his over&#173;worked legislative colleagues
would be released from their current back&#173;breaking duties.
 It's the least we can do for these suffering souls.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating - December 2, 1996<br>
The Recycling Grinch<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
 by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P><br><blockquote>

     By all objective standards, recycling is more expensive and
more wasteful of natural resources than sending solid waste to
a landfill.  A fact to remember this holiday season as you wash,
sort, and cart back to the supermarket those extra bottles and
cans to recover your nickels.
<P>
     Don't get us wrong.  We support recycling bottles and cans,
when it makes economic sense and is done voluntarily by private
businesses.  But forced, government recycling is an inefficient,
costly response to manufactured landfill scares.  
<P>
     Despite their haphazard appearance, modern landfills are
quite advanced.  Because of numerous government safety regulations,
landfills must be lined and covered with special protective layers
to prevent seepage of toxins into the air and water supply.  They
must also monitor and remove any gasses that can accumulate inside
the landfill.
<P>
     Ignorance of these and other landfill features abound, as
does the belief that there is a &quot;shortage&quot; of landfill
space.  Currently, space devoted to landfilling American waste
amounts to a volume one hundred yards deep by two&#173;thirds
of a mile square per year.  By the year 3000, according to Clark
Wiseman of Gonzaga University, given packaging innovation and
other factors, all the garbage of the United States will be able
to fit in a landfill 100 yards deep and 35 miles square, or less
than half that if it were compacted.
<P>
     So why are politicians closing landfills, and even using
wasteful bond acts and long term debt to do so?  Why are they
paying more to boost recycling, and ship trash out of state? 
<P>
     It is because in any policy debate over politically incorrect
things like landfills, where greater efficiency and lower prices
are diffused throughout society, such gains are often defeated
by a smaller group, who persuade the political class to protect
their own perceived special interests.  One example is the NIMBY&#173;types
(not in my backyard), and another the environmental lobbyists,
whose global aesthetic appeals undercut the importance of a strong
economy in providing a clean and healthy environment.
<P>
     Some communities, like Charles City County, Va., recognize
that the public good is a more complex equation.  As reported
by John Tierney in a recent New York Times Sunday Magazine, Charles
City County receives waste from New York City, which pays to send
it out of state.  In Charles City County, jobs are plentiful,
the environment is healthy, and the students have new computers
in their schools thanks to the influx of trash cash.  In contrast,
New York City, as Tierney wryly points out, has lots of environmentalist
indoctrination in the classroom, but an otherwise crumbling educational
infrastructure.
<P>
     New York in fact is now learning the expensive lesson that
when you eliminate the cheapest way to dispose of waste, you begin
to see increasingly baroque misdirections of public energy and
a piling on of costs.
<P>
      Take the costs you bear for your bottled beverages. You
pay hidden costs, which can amount to as much as seven cents per
container, because the supermarket must now administer the deposit,
run machines to crush the bottles and cans, and pay the kid to
clean up all the plastic bags dripping with soda or beer.  You
pay costs for the distributors to administer the program as well.
<P>
     Then, add in the cost of additional taxes you pay to your
local government who recycle almost everything &#173;&#173; except
your plastic bottles and aluminum cans (the only valuable stuff
to recycle) due to the deposit law.  You trudge back to the store
while the municipality loses tens of millions, or in New York
City, hundreds of millions per year (including millions in water
and fuel oil to wash garbage) recovering items worth nowhere near
what it costs to recycle them.   It all translates into more local
taxes.
<P>
     You can thank the great impresario of baroque government,
Mario Cuomo, for some of this absurd inefficiency.  The simple
repeal of his 1983 bottle deposit law would at least cut the losses
of municipal recycling programs.
<P>
     But why stop there?  In the spirit of the holidays, when
we all want to save time and money, let's do more than go to the
store for the big sale.  Let's call our local government bean
counters, and tell them to audit our recycling programs.  A clear
look at the books will show that the government, like a Green
Grinch, is stealing the money, the presents, the soft drinks,
even the oil and hot water from our Christmas.

Carolan & Keating - November 25, 1996<br>
The Germtooth Letters<BR>
<P>
</h2>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3></center>
<P>
<br><blockquote>

     Several decades past, one of this century's greatest Christian
apologists, C.S. Lewis, published his remarkable reports on secret
correspondence taking place between certain agents of evil from
the netherworld.  The Screwtape Letters, as it was called, shocked
an entire generation.
<P>
     Today, Carolan &amp; Keating have &#173;&#173; through certain
spiritual sources &#173;&#173; obtained copies of similar correspondence
between entities stationed in New York.  One such message is reprinted
here for your edification: <BR><p>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
Thursday, 11/21
<P>
My Dear Germtooth,<BR>

<P>
     I have received your message, and I'm a bit disappointed.
 Your promotion to Secretary of Infernal Affairs in the Second
District means you are eminently qualified to deliver many souls
to our Father Below.  But if so simple a holiday as Thanksgiving
is enough to frighten you, as it seems to do every year, then
may I suggest you return to us immediately, so that I may devour
you with stuffing.
<P>
     While Thanksgiving is nauseating, its acknowledgment of the
enemy is usually only temporary.  True, there are little inklings
of guilt throughout the season, and we watch with some concern
as many of our choice morsels stray back to religious services
for a day or two.
<P>
     But if you have laid the groundwork well, the slothful soul
will not stay long, sensing that his cherished &quot;freedom&quot;
is threatened by archaic moral commandments.  You can count on
him to eventually opt for one of our own non&#173;threatening
bait religions,
or return to his own &quot;private spirituality.&quot;  I do enjoy
a soul so richly basted in its own pride.
<P>
     As you surely know, the holiday provides us with other excellent
opportunities.  Gluttonous intemperance during the holiday season
can be nurtured through the new year into a scrumptious array
of sensuality and fornication, usually by summer.
<P>
     And don't forget how many delicious family squabbles can
be started by simply reminding your subject that the holiday must
be a perfect day, which is impossible, and then upsetting him
so upon seeing one's father in an ugly tie.  Many a fine assault,
or in ideal cases, a murder, has been enjoyed on this holiday
thanks to a bad tie.
<P>
     Here's an excellent recipe to exploit before dinner:  Take
a pound of natural hunger, mix with a pinch of apprehension over
being judged by others, or a slice of personal vanity.  Spill
one glass of wine, and add a few harsh words.  Garnish with sour
faces, and a sprig of old resentments.  Flambe according to taste.
 C'est manifique.
<P>
     After football, and hopefully a Cowboys' victory, I like
to save some scraps for later enjoyment.  Try this.  First, melt
down the subject's guilt from overeating into a simpler form,
then work it into a froth during a news report on the starving
in Rwanda.  Keep him focused on how uncaring the world is while
folding in generous portions of pride with his own charity.  This
produces a flaky, puffed up compassion; so great that the subject
loves
humanity, but is unable to care for the man in his office or the
child across the street.  Thus will he more easily condemn others
for having too much, which is always tasty.  This recipe was first
brought over to Greenwich Village, but is now also very popular
at the Capital, and in some Chancery offices.
<P>
     Speaking of the Capital, you are doing a fine job overseeing
the production of delicious morsels for our consumption.  We are
still reheating the last governor you sent us in that delightful
inflagrante delicto sauce.  
<P>
     And those hollow&#173;core legislators you have been sending!
 What a remarkable medley of amoral immorality!  SlubGob swears
it cannot be done by simple political compromise, no matter how
much you whip it.  You must send us the recipe.
<P>
     Of course, the enemy would have us and those mortals believe
He would be able to fully satisfy us, which would of course make
eternity dreadfully boring.  Surely there has to be some kind
of challenge.
<P>
     But our victims, despite their fallen state, retain this
absurd belief in final satisfaction.  Indeed, we would not enjoy
them so much if they didn't, redirecting that hope as we do into
the political system, which promises to give &quot;security,&quot;
and &quot;prosperity.&quot;  Once we have taken that hope away
from Him, the enemy, and directed into him, or him, or her, it
is amazing how we can turn them against each other, and into our
waiting claws.  <BR>

<P>
Ravenously yours,

Carolan & Keating - November 11, 1996<BR>
Bond Act on the Brain and Time for Big Al's Exit
<BR>
</h2>
<P>

<BR>
<blockquote>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he scene is a Manhattan hotel on election night at five minutes to nine.  Governor George Pataki is questioned about the Dole campaign by a local reporter. He answers by talking about the importance of his environmental bond act.  
<P>
Pataki is asked the question again.  The answer, once more, relates to the bond act.  When pressed another time, Pataki explains that the Dole camp "pulled out of New York about a month ago," so there was nothing that could be done.  Then, the Governor returns to the bond act.
<P>     
Those who read this column know that we have been generally supportive of George Pataki. We believe his tax cuts, for example, are a vital step to regaining New York's economic health.  We applaud Pataki's efforts to reform the worker's compensation system and lifting some regulations in the health-care arena.  But the Governor's behavior these past few months -- his myopic campaigning for the pork-barrel bond act especially -- raises serious doubts about both his strategic thinking and leadership regarding conservative ideas. 
<P>     
Forget the Dole campaign, which had it's own problems.  But what about the State Assembly races?  For months, many conservatives and Republicans have argued that winning the Assembly was vital to getting smaller government in New York.  Yet, with barely a peep from the Governor this fall, the GOP actually lost a few seats in the state legislature overall.
<P>     
Perhaps we should have seen the lack of leadership coming. Recall that last year, during another delayed budget, the Governor failed to bring that fight for smaller government to the mass media.  Now the Governor has traded his shot at a majority in the Assembly for personal image polishing with the Greens.  He is also rarely seen in Albany.  Such clear lack of strategic focus or zeal at the top of the GOP is surely not lost on Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat Chairwoman Judith Hope, or the handful of Democrats who seem eager to run for governor in 1998.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=left SIZE=3>
<P>
 <DD><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>s it our imagination or does Senator Al D'Amato become less and less subtle about his political opportunism with each passing day?
<P>    
After Bill Clinton scored big in New York, including heavily Republican Nassau County, Senator Al D'Amato made a remarkably transparent attempt to mend his reputation by suggesting maybe it's time to call a truce on Whitewater.  What irony, the most political Republican of all now reinforces the perception that the Whitewater investigations were always political by calling them off after the election.  This leaves the rest of D'Amato's party to answer the false charge of politicization, leading one Republican staffer to comment "Typical D'Amato. CYA." (Cover your a--).  
<P>
D'Amato performed a similar turnabout on primary night earlier this year.  After victoriously using the New York GOP's rigged primary rules for his own candidate, D'Amato called for eliminating those very rules in favor of a more open system.
<P>
     D'Amato's brazenness lies in the fact that everything he touches is political.  He poisoned Whitewater. He poisoned the bond act. He has poisoned George Pataki's reputation.  Nothing Al D'Amato does or says can be taken at face value.  Everything must be scrutinized for its underlying meaning.  Next time he holds a press conference to announce he's in love, listen carefully, there may be federal funding involved.
<P>     
We just wonder how much longer the GOP family will put up with brazen Al D'Amato.  How many losing candidates this year, for example, will work hard for King Al's re-election in 1998 after he left them to twist in the wind while he hawked the bond act?  Will many of these same local hacks continue to say "Yes boss," while enduring another of D'Amato's acid phone calls?
<P>
However, it's simply not a question of process with D'Amato any longer.  His political judgment must come into serious question in 1996, after appearing so astute in 1994.  After all, D'Amato led the early charge for Bob Dole.  D'Amato lined up every elected New York Republican official (barring Rudy Giuliani who came to Dole of his own accord much later) behind one of the most inept GOP presidential candidates ever.  D'Amato will attempt to blame the Dole loss on extremists in his party (some of D'Amato's local hacks started spinning this thesis on election night).  However, in reality, it was largely GOP liberals and moderates like D'Amato who pushed Bob Dole to the forefront.
<P>     
We wonder: Isn't there anybody in the whole New York GOP who will stand up and primary Al D'Amato -- some former Ambassador, some retired executive?  Is there no bond trader or investment banker in the state who refuses to kiss D'Amato's you-know-what?  Somebody who can't be bought with a patronage job, or who cares more about policy and economic freedom than pork.  Of course, there are some, but alas D'Amato controls the GOP patronage machine -- at least until 1998.  Post-1998 is when things might get interesting for New York Republicans.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- November 4, 1996<br>
Who Was Eugene Travis?<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>In a democracy, ideas and choices matter.  Under the best of circumstances, rival political parties offer the electorate real alternatives in terms of governing philosophies.  Indeed, a country or state's well-being depends not only on rigorous economic competition in the free marketplace, but healthy competition in the political market as well.
<p>When the line between political competitors begins to blur, the consequences can be severe.  For example, from the end of World War II until the late 1970s, Great Britain fell into this deadly trap.  Both the Labour Party and the Tories worshiped the false idol of democratic socialism.  As a result, Britain's economy and position on the world stage suffered dearly.  Neither political party offered an alternative until Margaret Thatcher became prime minister.  
<p>New York has suffered a similar fate in the twentieth century.  Supposedly, Republicans are the party of private enterprise, free markets, and traditional social values, while Democrats offer government action and liberal views on social issues.  Unfortunately, the line between Democrat and Republican in the Empire State often blurs.  
<p>Three current examples stand out.  First, Republican New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was elected with Liberal Party support, has shown little indication that he understands that high city taxes and regulations have all but extinguished the city's entrepreneurial spirit.  Giuliani's unwillingness to seriously cut taxes and government shows him to be more Democrat than Republican.  Second, bipartisan support among the state's elected officials for the environmental bond act on Tuesday's ballot clearly illustrated a blurring of the lines between the parties when it comes to pork spending -- which is what the bond act was primarily about -- and the environment.  And third, with the New York Republican Party now officially a pro-abortion party, the GOP can no longer be presumed as the party of traditional values, nor a party that protects life and liberty.
<p>However, blurred lines between parties is not new to New York.  Indeed, the most prominent example was Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who out-taxed and out-spent every other governor in our nation's history.  Running a close second was one-time Republican Mayor of New York City John Lindsay, the biggest tax-and-spend mayor in U.S. history.  Further back, one sees another New York City mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, the so-called fusion candidate.
<p>However, one of the earliest cases where New York's two parties lost distinction was in 1919, with New York's economy suffering heavy consequences to this day.  After the elections of 1918, Republicans controlled both state houses and Democrat Al Smith was the new governor.  Republican Eugene Travis served as state comptroller.
<p>With wartime prohibition coming into effect and the Prohibition amendment to the U.S. Constitution soon following, state officials were concerned over the loss of state and local revenues from liquor sales.  An inter-party deal was cut to impose a state income tax on individuals, allowing each party to avoid full blame.  With Republicans in control of both houses of the legislature, however, the income tax could have and should have been a dead issue.  
<p>Prominent opposition came from State Comptroller Travis.  Travis deemed the tax unnecessary.  For this simple act, Travis should be considered a Republican hero in New York.  He ignored an ugly deal other members of his party were willing to make at the time, and instead stood for principle, as well as fiscal and economic soundness.  
<p>Travis stood up against the most destructive and intrusive tax known to man -- the income tax.  The income tax has raised the costs of working, investing and risk taking -- the sources of economic growth -- while serving as high-octane fuel for the growth of government.
<p>Most political blurring in New York has been cases where Republicans give up on their limited-government principles in favor of traditional Democrat governmental activism.  The only prominent case of blurring in the opposite direction was when Democrat Governor Hugh Carey supported the elimination of the state's unincorporated business tax, a rather Republican thing to do.  The tax was phased out in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and entrepreneurship received a little boost in New York.  
<p>Recent Republican nibbling at the edges of big government and high taxes will not be enough to make New York an economic powerhouse once again.  If the GOP is to be a source of the Empire State's re-birth, they will have to advance bold measures.  
<p>Republicans should pick up the cause of Eugene Travis.  The income tax wasn't needed in 1919, and it surely will only hamper New York in the twenty-first century, with both capital and labor more easily avoiding onerous taxes.  Proposing an end to the anti-work, anti-investment, anti-risk-taking income tax would ignite entrepreneurship, economic growth, and job creation in New York for the first time in decades.  It also would be a major step toward New York Republicans becoming true Republican once again.

Carolan & Keating -- October 28, 1996<br>
Pre-Election Round-Up<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
<dd>A few observations before the November 5 election:
<ul>
<li>C&K's most interesting New York races to watch:<ol><li>Top notch Republican, Conservative, and Right-to-Life candidate Sue Wittig in New York's 26th CD has a real shot to topple nationally known green Democrat Maurice Hinchey; <li>Democratic Party honcho Judith Hope pins party hopes on Carolyn McCarthy -- whose husband was killed, and son shot in LIRR massacre -- in her race against Republican Dan Frisa in Long Island's 4th CD. McCarthy, a nice woman, knows nothing about the issues, including assault weapons ban she touts.  Big sympathy vote gives her the lead, though final Frisa mail blitz to undecideds could pull out the race in a conservative district.</ol>
<li>Missing: Governor of New York.  Governor Pataki has been seen promoting environmental pork bond act, catching a flight to Central Europe, and at Yankee Stadium.  However, the Dole for President campaign can't seem to find him.  Indeed, New York Republican lemmings must regret having followed their leader Senator D'Amato over the Dole cliff.
<li>It's a shame that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp have run an unbelievably inept presidential campaign and will lose on November 5.  The Dole-Kemp economic plan would have provided much-needed tax and regulatory relief for New York taxpayers, entrepreneurs and businesses.  The Dole-Kemp 15 percent across-the-board income tax reduction and the $500 per child tax credit would have saved New York families an estimated $1,646 per year on average.  The 50 percent cut in the capital gains tax, along with inflation indexing, would have provided a significant boost to investment, risk taking and economic growth.  Throw in some real regulatory and legal reform, and this Dole-Kemp plan makes the Pataki tax cuts look puny.  But New York will help send Clinton back to the White House, with real tax and regulatory reform put off until the next century.
<li>Throughout his career, Jack Kemp has enthusiastically reached out to black Americans and other minorities with a market-oriented agenda, while many others in his party neglected the minority vote.  We applaud Kemp's efforts. However, during recent weeks of this presidential contest, when Dole-Kemp can't even shore up the traditional GOP base, one has to wonder why Kemp still spends so much time in places like Harlem.  The numbers -- e.g., one percentage point of the black vote translates into roughly 0.1 percentage point of the total vote -- make it difficult to justify Kemp's regular campaigning in these final days in inner cities.  
<li>As is increasingly the case, New York Conservative Party turns out to be a mixed bag this year.  "Contract with New York" turns out to be a non-starter, as anti-Gingrich sentiment stifles talk of programmatic reform. However, Conservative Party legislative ratings for this year do show a decided shift to the right under Pataki, with even liberals like Sheldon Silver voting 50 percent conservative.  Perhaps lack of wedge issues produced grade inflation? Meanwhile, Tom Long, brother of Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long, gives Queens County Conservative Party endorsement in New York's 7th CD to fanatical pro-choice Republican Rose Birtley, running against pro-life Democrat Tom Manton by touting her support of partial-birth abortion.  Would Queens conservatives endorse similar extremists if they supported a progressive income tax or cutting patronage jobs for conservative lackeys?  Perhaps we don't want to know the answer to that question. Kudos, however, to Westchester conservatives for giving line to Joe DioGuardi, and not incumbent liberal GOPer Sue Kelly in 19th CD.  Kelly, for some undisclosed reason, warrants the undying, arm-twisting support of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<li>Memo to Long Island Congressman Peter King: Gerry Adams called. He wants to congratulate you for taking on Louis Farrakhan so courageously in your campaign literature.
<li>For once, C&K agrees with the New York Democratic Party.  They recently asserted that Senator D'Amato's ads for the environmental pork bond act essentially amount to political shilling to re-build Senator Pothole's reputation.
<li>Ron Lauder seems to be suffering from a split personality.  On the one hand, he fights the good fight to keep New York City's term limits in tact.  On the other hand, according to The New York Times, Lauder forked over $25,000 to support the environmental pork bond act.
<li>After hockey's Devils won a Stanley Cup, they got a new arena deal from New Jersey officials.  Likewise, the Yankees' World Series victory will seal the deal for a new $1 billion-plus, taxpayer-financed Yankee Stadium.
<li>Conservative opposition to the environmental pork bond act has not exactly been robust.  Of course, New York's unprincipled business groups largely support this $1.75 billion boost in New York debt.  Some supporters even claim that the bond act will create tens of thousands of jobs!  Will New York political and community leaders ever understand that only a robust private sector creates wealth and jobs?  We doubt it.

Carolan & Keating -  October 21, 1996<BR>
The Myth of the Common Man
<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>

<blockquote>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2>C</FONT>ruising the World Wide Web the other day, we came across the New York Democratic Party site.  Like most Web sites, it's a high-tech mix of text and graphics. But when you read it closely, you get a decidedly "retro" feeling. So retro in fact, it seems like the Democrats want you to forget the last 170 years ever happened.
<P>
     The Democratic Party, we are told, traces its origins back to two legendary American political figures: Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.  Jefferson was an "anti-Federalist," who wanted to keep power out of the hands of an aristocratic elite that gained
special favors from government -- a kind of politics that caused chaos in Europe. Despite Jefferson's distrust of the uneducated masses, it is said, he was a theoretician of limited-government who paved the way for mass democracy.
<P>     
But with the election of Andrew Jackson to the presidency in 1828, the common man came out of the political wilderness.  The Jacksonians, who distrusted bankers and reflected the Western pioneer spirit, defeated powerful aristocratic forces in the Senate to take the presidency. Jackson welcomed the average person to participate in the affairs of his country.  Shortly following his term, the U.S. witnessed a seven-fold increase in votes cast in a presidential election.  Today, the two heroes are celebrated by the Democrats at their annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinners. 
<P>     
Of course, when you look at today's New York State Republicans -- who seem about as close to an arrogant, self-serving European elite as you can get -- you can understand why Democratic passions for the common man are still inflamed.  But as far as we can tell, the Republicans at least spare us hypocritical history lessons.
<P>     
The Democratic myth of the "common man" has brought about exactly what Jefferson decried: saviors in government.  During the New Deal, the common man was told that an intrusive central government, run by the Democrats, would tell him what his interests and who his enemies were, and would tax and regulate him at unprecedented rates for his own good.  After the 1968 Democratic convention, the common man would become known by his better name, "member of the victim group," who needed the political class to gain redress for his discontents.
<P>     
New York's Democratic Party identifies the good of society with the good of certain segments of New York, like the teachers' unions, public employees unions, ethnic militants, and trial lawyers, among others.  But how, for example, does it advance the interests of the average family to drive up the cost of living through excessive taxation on income, food, fuel, and property, to support a burgeoning public sector?  How does it serve the interests of the common man to make him pay twice to give his child a religious education, or to be unable to fire lousy public school teachers?  How does it help the common man to pay excessive insurance rates because the Democrats protect trial lawyers who make fat commissions off excessive judgements?  To us it sounds an awful like the chaotic European politics Jefferson rejected.
<P>     
The problem of course is that America, and most assuredly New York, have abandoned Jefferson's most important notion: limited government.  Such a government makes no pretense to solve all man's problems, and does not manipulate groups of people in feats of social engineering.
<P>     
Indeed, in the eyes of Alexis de Tocqueville, when he came to observe the new experiment in democracy and chronicle it in Democracy in America, one of the saving graces of our nation was its absence of group or class envy.  The common man of de Tocqueville's day had no enemies for his government or his party to demonize. 
<P>     
We wonder if the same is true today.  Visit the Clinton/Gore '96 Web site, and you don't get that impression.  There, if you like, you can get updates on what the party will do for every victim group.  You can also download bumper stickers to support the common-man's President, who feels everybody's pain and protects the now-failing middle-class entitlements from demon Republicans.  There is a bumper sticker in Spanish, another with a pink triangle on it, and one for women.  But there was no bumper sticker that every one can use, one for "the common man" and his values.  Maybe that's because the common man doesn't put much value, or faith, in government.

Carolan & Keating -- October 14, 1996<br>
The Dying "Culture of Death"
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's ironic how destiny works.  Amidst all the hoopla in Albany over George Pataki's rather meager accomplishments, along with a dreary presidential campaign, a relatively unknown Attorney General by the name of Dennis Vacco quietly prepares to argue a case before the Supreme Court that will shake the republic, and make his a household name.
<p>The case is Quill v. Vacco, which the High Court has agreed to review after a Federal court struck down New York State's law against assisted suicide.  A decision will come early Summer.  No matter the outcome however, the case will mark the end of the culture of death.
<p>In the July 21 New York Times Sunday Magazine, the nation's foremost anti-euthanasia expert, Professor Yale Kamisar, expressed concerns that assisted suicide be seen as a privacy issue akin to that found in Roe v. Wade, which he supports.  Kamisar now wants limits on what one does with one's own body: "When the Court ruled in 1973, it termed abortion unique," the professor notes. "It never said the right of privacy should be extended this far."
<p>The Times reports that many pro-choicers are joining pro- lifers in a new anti-assisted-suicide coalition.  They argue that "pulling the plug," allowing someone to die from their own natural ailments, is not the same as intentionally killing them through lethal injection -- even if it is a "private" matter between a person and her doctor.
<p>We agree.  Who or what is the "cause of death" makes all the moral difference.  But Kamisar and friends are a little late.  When Dennis Vacco goes before the Supreme Court, he will be fighting seventy years of liberal jurisprudence -- which has deemed nearly every question of life and sexuality to be "religious" and therefore unconstitutional bases for the law.
<p>For example, in Hawaii, "marriage" is about to be redefined. Once linked to notions of heterosexuality, fidelity, and offspring, marriage is now an empty concept, to be defined according to one's constitutionally protected "liberty."  So too for "life," which the Casey decision says is another empty concept.  Mothers may define the "meaning" of the life of their child any way that want, and act accordingly.
<p>Now the new utopians say, "Why should we be bound by what Hippocrates said, when referring to both suicide and abortion he said: 'Doctors may not kill.'?"
<p>The chickens of privacy then have come home to roost.  Under the mantle of privacy, Americans have the right to be despairing lunkheads; to be shortsighted; to live life in terms of a false dilemma, and have doctors help them.  On abortion: "It's either my life, or this baby's, there is no other way."  On suicide: "Either I live in terrible pain, or somebody kills me (death with dignity), there is no other way."
<p>We do not agree with either murderous notion. As Hippocrates argued, there is always a middle way, and the doctor must find it.  Despite being armed with only a pestle and some herbs to ease pain, Hippocrates' had the more progressive vision, because he built medicine on metaphysics, which we have rejected.  He saw that doctors, as humans, not Gods, do not have the competence to determine the value of any life, but only to serve that life with pain relief, or healing.  It's ironic that with all our advanced skills for pain relief we demand the easier way.
<p>You can be sure however that our worried liberals will not invoke God before the Court, having already granted the humans god- like powers in Roe v. Wade and Casey.  They can only turn to their own self-interest, which may not be enough to stop the death march of liberty.  In the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is legal, doctors regularly kill people without their consent, because the law allows the doctor God-like judgement that some lives are objectively not worth living.
<p>If the Court strikes down state laws against assisted suicide, we expect a constitutional crisis undermining the judicially imposed culture of death.  Some governors are thought courageous enough to oppose the Court, like George Allen of Virginia, or Kirk Fordice of Mississippi.
<p>But even if the Court denies a broad right to assisted suicide, it is still a victory against the entire culture of death. For the Court would be implicitly accepting that medical tradition can have an objective nature against killing, against despair.  And from this small seed, new insights may grow.
<p>As psychiatrist Herbert Hendin told the Times about the desire for suicide, it is a "cry for help," and with proper care, the depression goes away.  Pain relief is always possible for the suicidal.  Then isn't the same relief, a fortiori, always possible for the depressed pregnant woman?
<p>Pray then, for Dennis Vacco. His job is nothing less than reversing the course of the established civil religion.

<br>
Higher Education in New York
<br>
</h2>
<p>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<br>

</center>
<p>
<blockquote>
Since the days of ancient Greece, the process of education has been about finding the "reality" beneath the appearances.  As today's parents wonder about higher education for their children, they should know New York's vaunted college market is not as it appears.
<p>For example, take some course offerings at New York's "finest" educational institutions, as surveyed by the Young America's Foundation.  At Columbia, students can opt for "English W3500y: Topics in Gay Male Representation," or "Spanish and Portuguese BC3135y: Reading for Difference: Lesbian and Gay Themes."  At Cornell there's "Housing and Feeding the Homeless," or "Lesbian Personae," "Gay Fiction," or "Introduction to Sexual Minorities."  At New York University, there's "Race, Class, Gender, and Ethnicity in the City: The Politics of Urban Society," and "Sexual Diversity in Society."  
<p>Thinking of sending your daughter of Vassar?  Get ready for "From Bohemia to Queer: Contemporary Lesbian and Gay Communities in America," or "The Politics of Difference," which "explicitly explores," according to the catalog, "issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation."
<p>These once-elite schools now reflect all the rot that has crept into "post-modern" education. The traditional core curriculum, which emphasized logical skill and general historical knowledge, has been dismantled in favor of the narrow, ideologically driven study of "socially constructed identity," and "victims of oppression." 
<p>An interesting lesson in how to respond to this nonsense comes from one of the classic texts of conservatism, God and Man at Yale by William F. Buckley, Jr.  The book caused a firestorm among Yale alumni some four decades ago with its dramatic charge that Yale had abandoned the traditional religious ideals of its Protestant founders.  And the book's success proved that no matter how much bleating there is about "academic freedom," academics teach at the grace of the alumni who keep the school and its particular traditions afloat.  If you violated those traditions, as was done at Yale, you lost funding.
<p>That's why we advise any donor to a school to do more than read the propaganda newsletter mailed out by your alma mater.  Read the course catalog, talk to fellow alumni, and ask the students how many classes are being taught about lesbians with a VCR instead of Dante and Shakespeare with a primary text.
<p>Of course, radical academics are not standing still.  They have been doing their level best to eliminate alumni control, by dramatically increasing the federal and state role in education. Now the government can demand diversity, civil rights, and affirmative action for "victim groups" in the schools.  And taxpayers already living paycheck to paycheck, with government laying claim to 40 percent of their income, have little time or incentive to root out university crackpots, though rich alumni might.
<p>Look at the slide in the State University of New York (SUNY) schools.  A shocking study by the Empire Foundation and the National Association of Scholars details just how far afield the multicultural fad has taken taxpayer-funded education in New York.  Using SUNY's own data, it was found that at the 16 major SUNY campuses studied, only half required students to take course work in Western Civilization, but all mandated the study of gender, sexuality, afrocentrism, etc.
<p>It was also found that at all the schools, students can entirely avoid taking quite a few of the eight traditional core courses.  At SUNY-Binghamton, for example, students are required to take gym, but not English composition, math, literature, or philosophy.  And at Freedonia, students can get through four years of college and never have to take any classes in history, literature, philosophy, foreign languages, arts, or science.  Kind of reminds us of the Freedonia run by Groucho Marx.
<p>And even where core requirements exist, students can satisfy the requirement with esoteric multicultural courses like "Saints, Witches, and Madwomen" (New Paltz's Writing requirement), or "Horror Literature" (Old Westbury, Writing and Reasoning Skills), or "Literature of Sports" (Cortland, Literature), instead of more rigorous general knowledge courses.
<p>What has been the response of the SUNY educrats to these criticisms, and others about alarming drop-out rates and declining SAT standards for entering SUNY student?  "The Empire Foundation is run by rich guys who hate taxes and don't like public education."  Those benefitting from a classical education recognize the logical fallacy known as the ad hominem circumstantial: dismissing your opponent because of his background instead of answering the argument.
<p>We'll admit our bias.  We think government-funded higher education is inherently wasteful, and destroys educational performance in favor of narrow political goals.  Of course, the trustees of SUNY, and the Faculty Senate (who are meeting this week), could prove us wrong.  They can change SUNY's course from left-wing indoctrination to a truly liberal education.  But until they do, we'll continue to consider ourselves the victims of their oppression.

<h2>
Carolan & Keating -- September 16, 1996<BR>
Any Real Conservatives in New York?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
In recent years, a few skirmishes seem to have broken out on the
conservative side of the political aisle.  Many in the media,
of course, have portrayed this as an epic war on the right between
social conservatives and economic conservatives.
<P>
Like most true conservatives, we fail to see what all the fuss
is about.  We're both economically and socially conservative &#173;&#173;
supply&#173;side, pro&#173;family, free&#173;trade, pro&#173;life,
hawkish, internationalist, property&#173;rights, small&#173;government
conservatives.
<P>
The controversy arises when self&#173;proclaimed &quot;conservative&quot;
politicians turn out, in reality, to be moderates or fence&#173;sitters.
 New York and the rest of the Northeast are full of such impersonators.
 Indeed, Governors Bill Weld (Massachusetts), Christie Whitman
(New Jersey), John Rowland (Connecticut), and New York's own George
Pataki, all claim to be conservatives.  However, their records
and positions show each to be mild economic and fiscal conservatives,
while being quite liberal on many social issues, most prominently
on abortion.
<P>
On the flip side, Pat Buchanan claims the mantle of conservatism
as well.  But in reality, Buchanan turns out only to be conservative
on social issues, while on the economics front he has become a
raving class warrior, touting the liberal, big&#173;labor line
on issues like trade and immigration.
<P>
This division between Buchananites and middle&#173;of&#173;the&#173;road
Republicans turns out not really to be a battle on the right at
all, but a fight between two very confused camps within the Republican
Party.  One side fails to understand the value of human life while
the other misunderstands the value of free, unfettered markets.
 Neither are conservative in a complete sense.
<P>
To get a sense of how truly conservative the New York congressional
delegation is, C&amp;K turned to two sources.  The Christian Coalition,
a pro&#173;family group with more than 1.7 million members, rated
the 104th Congress according to 13 key votes in the House of Representatives
and 11 key votes in the Senate.  These votes offer a good representation
of socially conservative issues, from abortion to welfare reform
to school vouchers to tax cuts.  The Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC), a pro&#173;entrepreneur, pro&#173;free market advocacy
group with more than 40,000 small business members (C&amp;K's
Keating serves as chief economist for SBSC), rated Congress according
to 25 key votes in the House and 18 key votes in the Senate. 
The issues ranged from deregulation to private property rights
to spending reductions to tax cuts &#173;&#173; a good representation
of conservative economic issues.  
<P>
Indeed, as any good conservative would expect, the two organizations
had some overlap in terms of the issues on which Members of Congress
were rated.  Each group used a scoring system whereby 100 rated
best and 0 rated worst.  In the accompanying chart, C&amp;K combined
the two scores to arrive at a gauge for the complete conservative,
and ranked New York's congressional delegation accordingly.  A
perfect score is 200.
<P>
Not to our surprise, no New York Member of Congress scored a perfect
200, though three House Members impressively scored in the 190s.
 These three &#173;&#173; Solomon, Frisa, and Paxon &#173;&#173;
are all Republicans.  Gilman, Houghton, and worst of all, Boelhert
rated least conservative among New York GOPers in the House.
<P>
No Democrats scored well.  The least liberal, you might say, was
McNulty in the House, followed by LaFalce and Manton.  Ackerman,
Hinchey, and Serrano scored perfectly liberal zeros.
<P>
As for the Senate, Al D'Amato scored slightly favorable on the
conservative meter, and Pat Moynihan miserably.
<P>
Obviously, these ratings are not comprehensive, in that they reflect
only select key votes.  But they do give the reader a feeling
of where their elected officials generally come down  &#173;&#173;
left or right &#173;&#173; on the issues.
<P>
Overall, New York's congressional delegation rates very liberal.
 Indeed, in our view, the Empire State can claim only one or two
across&#173;the&#173;board principled conservatives in Congress.
 Meanwhile, little more can be said at the state level, with a
handful of principled conservatives in the Assembly and none to
be found among state senators, the Governor or the Lieutenant
Governor.
<P>
Of course, this dearth of true conservatism explains why New York
ranks among the worst in the nation in areas like taxes, government
spending, entrepreneurship, job creation, and abortions.<BR>

Carolan & Keating -- September 9, 1996<BR>
Power to the People?<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan &amp; Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
     Remember the energy crisis of the 1970s: gas rationing, lines
at the pump, inflation?  Well, there was a silver lining, which
might now pay off big for New Yorkers.
<P>
      When experts predicted oil at $100 per barrel back then,
the power industry &#173;&#173; long a government&#173;protected
monopoly &#173;&#173; was forced to innovate. The 1978 National
Energy Act mandated that local utilities buy power from &quot;QFs&quot;
or qualifying facilities (wind power, solar power, etc.).  When
oil prices stabilized, QFs became boondoggles.  But at the same
time, they stirred a revolution called &quot;wheeling.&quot; 
Wheeling moves electricity long distances over transmission wires
and allows utilities to buy cheap surplus power from each other.
<P>
     Washington is about to repeal many arcane regulations in
wheeling and power production, creating an exciting, fluid market.
 Power producers will now be able to reconfigure and recapitalize
like other businesses, and sell across the country or around the
world.
<P>
     More importantly, they will be able to compete to sell to
individual homeowners (retail wheeling), just like in local and
long distance phone service.  Experts predict lower prices, which
will ripple throughout the economy.  Under federal waivers some
projects have already started.  Last April, New Hampshire began
wheeling for 17,000 customers.
<P>
     The state Public Service Commission (PSC), which governs
New York's utilities, has long called for retail wheeling.  An
admirable position, since not often do government regulators give
up jobs. But we fear their goal of retail power here by 1998 could
be derailed.
<P>
     As power producers and government disentangle, many inefficient
facilities, no longer protected by regulation, will have their
real value exposed by the market.  Naturally investors will look
for a bailout.  Many of the PSC's governing &quot;principles&quot;
for a retail market &#173;&#173; i.e. &quot;fair trade,&quot;
&quot;environmental protection,&quot; etc. &#173;&#173; provide
lots of wiggle room for these special interests to stick costs
on ratepayers.  Recent battles in Washington over telecommunications
deregulation went that way.
<P>
     What concerns us also is the role of New York's government&#173;created
power &quot;authorities,&quot; like the New York Power Authority
(NYPA), and the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA).
<P>
     NYPA was created in 1931, originally on the St. Lawrence
River to provide power to the Massena area. Like most government
bureaucracies it has regularly expanded its mission.  NYPA suggests
it is &quot;uniquely positioned&quot; to handle &quot;all&quot;
power transmission in the new retail market.  Some are suggesting
NYPA buy up transmission grids and independent power producers.
<P>
     LIPA was created in 1986 to respond to the reversal of fortune
of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.  After the Three Mile Island
accidents, attitudes toward Shoreham changed and LILCO investors
were left with a $4 billion liability.  A deal was made for LIPA
to dismantle the plant for $1, while the PSC still haggles with
LILCO over recovering its losses, a prime obstacle to recapitalizing
the utility.  The government solution is to have LIPA issue municipal
bonds to buy LILCO, thus eliminating federal taxes on it, thus
reducing electric rates for Long Islanders.  The Governor tells
us LIPA will eventually sell off parts of LILCO but run transmission.
<P>
     We wonder why, however, in the coming fluid market, government
authorities need to be involved at all.  There are, of course,
political reasons, such as relationships with bond traders and
grateful investors who contribute to political campaigns.  There
are the votes of myopic rate&#173;payers, clamoring for immediate
relief.  What's more, New York's authorities offer excellent opportunities
for patronage. Many a former free&#173;market conservative has
found a lucrative, out&#173;of&#173;the&#173;way home there.
<P>
     But why should LIPA buy generators, which might be worth
nothing in a market full of new generators?  Consumers will get
stuck with the cost.  (Or, a more efficiently capitalized LILCO
could also recover in the new world market.)
<P>
     Why should NYPA and LIPA lock up all the transmission business
in New York?  Recapitalized utilities can run transmission lines
themselves, and other entities with rights&#173;of&#173;way, like
railroads, subways, and phone companies, can stop monopolies by
offering transmission in a dynamic market.
<P>
     Clyde Crews of the Competitive Enterprise Institute warns:
&quot;The worst thing you can have is a government&#173;controlled
monopoly on transmission.&quot;  Even a private monopoly would
be better, he notes, since an unprotected monopoly would more
easily spur competing building of extra transmission facilities,
or even innovative production to circumvent the monopoly, (such
as microturbines for home use).
<P>
     The state PSC has so far kept NYPA at arms' length, offering
only vague statements that NYPA may have &quot;some role.&quot;
 They should have no role.  LIPA too should be dismantled.  LILCO
investors are victims of regulatory fickleness by government,
but that's their problem.  There is no need to lock ratepayers
into dangerous long&#173;term government deals, when so much potential
savings exists in the emerging market.
<P>
     These are the political obstacles.  We just hope the PSC
gets tough with special interests.

Carolan & Keating -- September 2, 1996<BR>
Term Limits: City and State<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
     You know liberalism is in trouble when even New York City
Council members, some of the state's most hard&#173;left politicos,
are aping Bill Clinton by cloaking themselves in the mantle of
conservatism.  Just look at their current attempt to protect their
jobs with their &quot;responsible&quot; version of term limits
this fall.
<P>
     Recall that in 1993, New Yorkers voted 60 percent to 40 percent
to impose limits on their Council members of two terms of four
years each.  Now the Council is trying to weasel out from under
the law, offering a referendum to change the limits from eight
years to 12, and to &quot;restart the clock&quot; on their careers
so that many of them won't have to leave until 2007.  Council
Speaker and perpetual politician Peter Vallone argues that without
these changes there will be &quot;absolute chaos,&quot; as &quot;inexperienced&quot;
politicians take over the whole Council at once.
<P>
     Anyone who follows the City Council knows what its &quot;experience&quot;
is like. This past year the New York Post offered a shocking expose
of Council members' poor attendance records, uncouth manner, and
lack of initiative.  Priscilla Wooten, Democrat from Brooklyn,
recently summarized her 14&#173;year career in one line: &quot;I
just know how to play the game.&quot;
<P>
     A cadre of unelected special interests &#173;&#173; labor
unions, ethnic militants, real estate developers, and party bosses
&#173;&#173; help keep the same old hacks in power, bleeding the
city and state.  Much fault lies also with New Yorkers, who either
benefit from Council greed or don't turn out to vote.  Yet, even
the most principled voter can't undo this mess if given only a
&quot;choice&quot; of candidates dominated by those interests.
<P>
     Term limits takes the &quot;career&quot; out of politics,
offering a government based on ideas rather than personal friendships
and payoffs.  Term limits have been recommended by Thomas Jefferson,
John Adams, Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, and Dwight
Eisenhower.  Studies by the CATO Institute show a direct correlation
between length in office and increased pork&#173;barrel spending.
<P>
     According to U.S. Term Limits, 21 states, mostly out West
where big government is less in vogue, have instituted term limits
for their state legislators.  Over 3,000 localities across the
U.S. now have limits, with 26 localities in New York State (10
passing limits in 1993 alone).  And in major cities like New Orleans
and Kansas City, as Ronald Lauder points out, term limits have
not produced any negative consequences.
<P>
     Expect the battle in New York City to get personal.  Desperate
politicians are sure to try to muddy the waters, accusing millionaire
Lauder &#173;&#173; a prime mover behind New York's term limits
movement &#173;&#173; of what they themselves are guilty of: &quot;allowing
money to influence the political process.&quot;   Allen Roth,
a spokesman for Mr. Lauder, notes: &quot;As long as the voters
know that they now have the term limits they want, they won't
accept the Council's arguments.&quot;
<P>
     Internal polls for the term limits movement show opposition
to the Council's changes stands at 70 percent.  The most recent
New York Post poll shows support for the current limits at 63
percent to 18 percent.     And informed sources also tell us that
a surprising number of influential liberals are soon to denounce
the Council's term&#173;limits revision.  Mr. Lauder is going
to spend &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to defeat the new initiative.
 Even the New York Times, which does not support term limits,
has accused Vallone of trying to do an &quot;end run&quot; around
the will of the voters.  Expect a major defeat for the Council
this fall.
<P>
     Can conservatives parlay the scalping of Mr. Vallone into
something more?  The Conservative Party's &quot;Contract with
New York&quot; calls for term limits as part of the overall strategy
to win the statehouse this year.  And a poll conducted recently
by Fabrizio&#173; McLaughlin and Associates shows that voters
are more likely, by a margin of 72 percent to 10 percent, to support
a candidate who pledges to limit his own term.  Seems like a golden
opportunity for the New York GOP, which has been trying to win
the Assembly for years. 
<P>
     We're not so sure, however, that the current Republican leadership
are at all interested.  (After all, New York Republicans seems
as enthralled with doling out billions in pork dollars each year
as Democrats are.)  And under current law, no referendum to amend
the state constitution can go to the voters before the politicians
in Albany deign to support it on two separate legislative sessions.
 That's unlikely.
<P>
     Conservative activists need to put the heat on Governor Pataki,
who allegedly supports term limits.  If Pataki fails to make the
case for a term limits referendum &#173;&#173; a golden opportunity
for Assembly candidates this fall &#173;&#173; he would clearly
line up on the side of pork over principle.  A sufficient reason,
we think, for the Conservative Party leaders (who despise pork)
to run their own gubernatorial candidate in 1998.

Carolan & Keating -- August 26, 1996<BR>
The Costs of Public Universities in New York<BR>
</h2>
<P>
<h3>
by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating<BR>
</h3>
</center>
<P>
As collegians head back to campuses across New York and the rest
of the nation, our thoughts turn to the state and cost of higher
education today.  In particular, the taxpayer costs for the Empire
State's public universities are much steeper than most New Yorkers
seem to realize.
<P>
Make no mistake, both public and private institutions of higher
learning suffer problems.  The college professor, as one observer
has wryly noted, stands as the only profession &#173;&#173; perhaps
barring prostitution &#173;&#173; where productivity has actually
dropped since the time of Socrates.  Tenure shields teachers from
the healthy pressures of the marketplace.  College and university
professors regularly argue for increased compensation and fewer
working hours through their unions.  And while we all need to
stay abreast of the latest developments in our respective fields,
few of us can imagine getting regular sabbaticals &#173;&#173;
only in academia. 
<P>
When a work load of one, two, or perhaps three courses a semester
becomes too burdensome, &quot;over&#173;worked&quot; professors
can turn teaching duties over to graduate students.  In which
case, parents wind up paying for their sons and daughters to attend
classes with student teachers standing at the front of the classroom.
 Too often, professors are off publishing, while quality teaching
perishes.  Indeed, the ivy covered walls of academia can hide
many woes.
<P>
Meanwhile at private institutions, tuition costs rise ever higher,
no matter what the economic climate it seems.  But at least in
the private marketplace, individuals make a choice based on price.
 I.e., selecting a college and paying the commensurate tuition
is not coercive in nature, it is a choice.  The same cannot be
said of public university systems like the State University of
New York (SUNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY).  Tuition
and fees come no where near covering the full cost of education
at SUNY or CUNY.  New York taxpayers foot the majority of the
bill.
<P>
Public university systems serve as glaring examples of good intentions
through government action gone predictably far awry, resulting
in bloated bureaucracies and skyrocketing costs.  Naturally, New
York offers the most bloated university system.  SUNY, created
in 1948, ranks as the largest state university system in the nation
with 64 campuses.  CUNY, whose forerunners were given birth in
the 1930s, ranks third biggest with 19 schools.  State taxpayers
assumed responsibilities for financing CUNY's senior colleges
and capital programs after New York City proved itself financially
inept during the fiscal crisis of the 1970s.
<P>
The per student (full&#173;time equivalent) total cost of running
SUNY equals about $22,700 annually.  CUNY tops the $23,000 per
student (full&#173;time equivalent) mark.  In the meantime, undergraduate
tuition at SUNY is about $3,400 and $3,200 at CUNY.
<P>
Compared with other states, the average salary for a full&#173;time
professor at a public university in New York ranked fourth highest
in the nation in 1994 at just under $75,000.  Mind you, this is
based on a nine&#173;month contract.  In addition, New York claims
the highest per capita cost for state undergraduate scholarship
and grant programs in the nation.  And on top of all these state
campuses and costs, localities run their own community colleges
across New York.
<P>
The time has arrived to dismantle this government education monstrosity.
 With thousands of private colleges and universities across the
nation, no need exists for government&#173;run institutions of
higher learning.  These public colleges and universities originally
were created out of fears that private colleges were either too
costly or discriminatory.  Well, today, the total costs &#173;&#173;
student and taxpayer combined &#173;&#173; for SUNY and CUNY outpace
costs at many of the nation's most elite private universities,
and discrimination pertaining to college admissions is nothing
but a fading memory.  If anything, affirmative action has fostered
reverse discrimination.
<P>
Some will argue that the tuition costs at private colleges and
universities still remain out of reach for many students.  If
true, then doesn't it make more sense to provide a means&#173;tested
voucher to students in actual need for private institutions, rather
than maintaining a huge, costly government bureaucracy?
<P>
Lastly, closing or privatizing two of the nation's largest public
university systems would offer another benefit.  Unproductive
professors would be booted off the taxpayer dole.  Who knows,
private colleges and universities may some day demand more of
their professors, handsomely compensating excellence and punishing
non&#173;performance.  If it ever happens, it will be at a private,
not a government, school.

<h2> Carolan & Keating  -- August 19, 1996<br>
The Welfare Oracle</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a jolly fellow.  With PBS's Charlie Rose or on This Week with David Brinkley, the senior Senator from New York makes everybody laugh.  Only one thing gets Moynihan upset: when somebody else tries to reform welfare. <p>
<dd>     After all, Pat Moynihan is America's welfare oracle.  Having taken a courageous stand in the 1960s with writings explaining the damage social programs do to black families (Beyond the Melting Pot and The Negro Family: The Case for National Action), Moynihan has been living off his reputation ever since.  His own record on welfare reform is a disaster. <p>
<dd>     Moynihan was a part of the Nixon Administration's failed efforts at "family assistance" in 1969, and his attempts at welfare reform in 1988 did nothing to "end welfare as we know it." Moynihan has spent his career simply tinkering around the edges of big government, preserving for another day his role as "welfare scholar." <p>
<dd>     The current welfare reform law just passed, which has Moynihan in hysterics, is a modest effort, and a mixed bag.  It does end the most crucial fault of federal welfare policy: the guaranteed right to assistance, regardless of behavior.  It also allows time limits, which are long overdue. <p>
<dd>     However, these time limits are too lengthy, and rather than getting welfare out of the hands of the federal government entirely, the measure offers only minor flexibility for states.  Meanwhile, federal welfare spending continues its ascent, albeit at a slower rate, and the demand for workfare will do nothing but create more bureaucracy. <p>
<dd>     Senator Chicken Little calls these minor changes "the most brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction."  Later, more guardedly, he admits: "We don't know what's going to happen." <p>
<dd>     We know what's happened so far.  Since the 1960s taxpayers have sunk over $5.4 trillion dollars into welfare, with a horrifying rise in illegitimate births (now 70 percent among blacks and above 30 percent among whites) and octupled spending to show for it. Illegitimacy is the single greatest contributing factor to poverty. At least now the states will have some ability to make demands on recipients -- a necessary change.  Pat Moynihan, who hasn't had anything intelligent to say on welfare in 25 years, can try his "expertise" elsewhere. <p>
<dd> Hats off to State Senator John Marchi of Staten Island for showing political imagination on welfare while Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki just cry to the media about what federal reform will do to New York. <p>
<dd>     Writing in the August 12 New York Times, Marchi notes that under current judicial interpretation, Article XVII of the State Constitution, the one that guarantees assistance to the poor, has been construed to hold that nothing more than "need" can be considered in giving aid.  No other state in the union has such a policy, which helps to explain why New York spends almost twice the national average on welfare.  New York's Medicaid spending stands at more than Texas and California combined. Marchi wants to change the Amendment, giving the state more flexibility to restrict social programs on behavioral grounds. <p>
<dd>     Of course, guess who's standing in the way?  Democrat Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver knows the poverty industry serves as one of his key special-interest constituencies. He is blocking a possible amendment from going to the voters of New York State. <p>
<dd>     This is a golden opportunity for the Republicans in the fall elections.  If New-Democrat Bill Clinton can reform welfare by taking away blanket guarantees, New Yorkers certainly can as well.  Indeed, such a step becomes imperative if New York is to avoid being even more overwhelmed by welfare rejects from more frugal states. <p>
<dd> Get rid of welfare, it can't be "reinvented."  Peter Salins of Hunter College and the National Center for Policy Analysis in Texas have a better idea: private unemployment insurance.  With extra disposable income from lower taxes once welfare is gone, private citizens can buy cheaper, more efficient unemployment protection, which along with private charity will provide a better safety net. <p>
<dd>      Private policies tie costs to behaviors.  With government, where various poverty interest groups simply force others to pay, wise behavior is not necessary, and costs inevitably explode. The same thing occurs with government health insurance and other forms of "social security," as FDR called them.  Call it the anaesthetic society, where people numbed by government have no reason to stop biting their tongue. <p>
<dd> The charge that welfare reform "will throw millions of children onto the streets" raises a serious concern.  Welfare has become a kind of blackmail liberals want us to pay to irresponsible parents so they don't hurt innocent children.  Such blackmail is made easy if welfare can be had by simply filling out a form.  If the blackmailers had to look other people in the eye, and mend their ways, like they do at private charities, they would be less bold.  State-level government welfare, rather than federal, is a start, but the more local and more private the help, the more quickly these kinds of child abuse will disappear.<p>

VPs from New York: From Rockefeller to Kemp?</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<dd>The last New York Republican to serve as Vice President of the United States was Nelson Rockefeller under President Gerald Ford.  However, the former New York Governor was Republican in name only.  Today, the name "Rockefeller" is anathema to all but the few most liberal members of the GOP, as Rockefeller earned infamy as the biggest tax-and-spend Governor in our nation's history. <p>
<dd>During the GOP's darkest hour -- Watergate -- Ford chose Nelson Rockefeller as his VP.  The selection proved so unpopular that Rockefeller was forced to withdraw from seeking the number two spot on the 1976 campaign ticket, which eventually went to Bob Dole.<p>
<dd>Now twenty years later, Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole has turned to New York for his own running mate.  To a New Yorker, though, with a decidedly different political philosophy than many other New York GOPers: former Buffalo Bills quarterback, New York Congressman (for 18 years from the Buffalo area), and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp.  With the combination of his plan to cut taxes and the Kemp pick, Dole has managed to energize his formerly moribund campaign. <p>
 	<dd>With almost any other New York Republican as his number two, we would have written off the Dole campaign.  In so many ways, however, Kemp has always been the antithesis of the standard New York Republican. <p>
<dd>Kemp believes in the power of ideas, while the New York GOP generally believes in watching polls.  Kemp emphasizes supply-side tax cuts (he was political father to the Reagan tax cuts), deregulation, and sound money as the keys to prosperity.  The New York GOP, particularly the state and national legislators, often prefer government pork barrel spending. <p>
<dd>Kemp is pro-choice when it comes to education, and pro-life on the abortion issue --contrary to many leading New York Republicans. <p>
<dd>Kemp also possesses a Reagan-esque vision about the economy, individuals, and the nation; in contrast to often dour New York Republicans.  Where Kemp poses a real alternative to politics as usual with his boundless optimism, many New York Republicans have tried to merely slow down what they seem to think is New York's inevitable decline. <p>
 Kemp's optimism is already paying dividends for the Dole campaign.  He fires up the GOP activists -- from supply-siders to pro-lifers -- and helps the ticket reach out to blue-collar Reagan Democrats -- lost by George Bush -- and creates inroads to minority communities. <p>
<dd>Kemp's only weaknesses from a conservative perspective are his somewhat favorable view of affirmative action and some evidence of squeamishness when it comes to deep cuts in government spending.  Dole generally remedies such woes, however. <p>
<dd>The prospect of Kemp as Vice President could change New York's political dynamic as well.  Kemp could help polish the long-tarnished reputation of the New York GOP on the national stage, perhaps even restoring New York's good name to the pre-Bull-Moose days of Teddy Roosevelt.  Also, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is now sure to endorse Dole-Kemp (Kemp endorsed Rudy in his bid for mayor).  And remember that Governor Pataki always has had very good things to say about Kemp as a presidential choice.  After all, Kemp helped boost Pataki's gubernatorial campaign in its final days by traveling the state with Pataki, focusing on tax cuts.  A new Giuliani-Kemp-Pataki connection would surely change the fortunes of the New York GOP nationally and within the state. <p>
<dd>Will Kemp swing New York in favor of Dole?  Surprisingly, New York State has gone Republican in five of the past eleven presidential campaigns, and in three of the last six.  If nothing else, Kemp's strengthening of the ticket will help tighten up the numbers in the Empire State, thus giving the GOP a better shot in New York state and federal legislative races.  But barring any new Clinton scandals, New York will likely stay with Clinton. <p>
<dd>Still C&K sees a Dole-Kemp Administration offering both promise and challenge to the New York GOP.  Lower personal income and capital gains taxes promised by Dole, added on to the Pataki tax cuts, will help boost New York's economy.  Dole's promise to return power to the states under the Tenth Amendment, as well as his plans to use the new presidential line item veto, something even Ronald Reagan didn't have, threaten to dismantle New York's poverty industry and sink the pork barrel. <p>
<dd>Questions naturally arise:  Are New York Republicans ready to rise to the challenge that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp pose, now and during a possible Kemp presidency beginning in 2000?  Is the New York GOP ready for a more mature governing philosophy of lower taxes, less spending, and less insider dealings?  Can they shake off Nelson Rockefeller for Jack Kemp? <p>
<dd>To some extent, Governor Pataki and the GOP New York State Assembly have begun this process.  The jury is still out on the Republican State Senate and the verdict looks bad for Mayor Giuliani, who reneged on a promise to let the city's personal income tax surcharge finally expire.  We'll see in the coming months.

Olympic Fever in New York
</h2>
<p>
<h3>by Matthew Carolan and Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>Like most everyone else, C&K is looking forward to the summer Olympics getting underway this week in Atlanta.  From baseball to gymnastics, fencing to sailing, skeet shooting to equestrian events, we'll watch as much of the games as we can, wearing our sports nationalism proudly.  C&K has caught Olympic fever. <p>
<dd>Recent reports illustrate that New York politicians are not immune to this fever either.  In fact, some of them are so excited they're planning to try to lure the Olympics, once more, to New York.  Previously, the winter games came to Lake Placid in both 1932 and 1980. <p>
<dd>Lake Placid is at it again.  The village's mayor, T. James Strack, recently announced that Lake Placid is considering a bid for the winter games of 2022.  Talk of competing for games so far off in the future is difficult to take seriously.  However, on June 26, The New York Times quoted Strack declaring: "Any good plan is a plan that is developed 25 to 30 years in advance."  We'll leave it to the future and our readers to decide whether Mayor Strack is a long-term visionary, or just an opportunistic politician looking to garner some short-term media attention. <p>
<dd>In the meantime, a more immediate effort has begun to bring the summer Olympics of 2008 to New York City.  No doubt, it's an exciting notion.  However, wild-eyed predictions are being made by various politicians and boosters in terms of the impact and costs of actually bringing the Olympics to the Big Apple.  We are told that tens of thousands of new jobs will be created at no cost to New York taxpayers.  Given Mayor Giuliani's similar predictions regarding a new government-built and owned stadium for the Yankees on Manhattan's west side, New Yorkers would be wise to be skeptical of such grand predictions. <p>
<dd>A sober assessment obviously is needed.  And we don't mean an assessment by a consulting firm paid for by the people in favor of the Olympics coming to New York City.  An independent assessment is required.  C&K humbly offers its services. <p>
<dd>First, it is crucial to understand that bringing the Olympics to New York City will in no way cure the city's economic ills.  The actual boost to the economy will be short-term in nature -- albeit probably a substantial economic blip, but a blip nonetheless.  Only deep tax cuts, regulatory relief, and government downsizing will cure New York City's economy, which has been in decline for decades. <p>
<dd>Second, if the games are funded through the private sector -- as is the attempt traditionally -- then whatever boost does occur will be real.  Extensive government involvement will only serve to tarnish the games -- creating numerous inefficiencies and boosting costs.  Fundamentally, private, voluntary funding is always far preferable to government taxation.  The market works far better than government bureaucrats. <p>
<dd>However,  just when New York City seeks the games, of course, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) seems on the verge of making government financial guarantees a part of the Olympics bidding process.  Preliminary cost estimates to bring the games to New York City in 2008 run in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion.  We wouldn't be surprised to see that number rise considerably.  In comparison, the Atlanta games will cost about $1.7 billion. <p>
<dd>One needs to remember that the 1984 games in Los Angeles were the first to actually make money.  The IOC obviously is seeking to protect itself from future losses through government guarantees.  In addition to the clear affront to New York's already overburdened taxpayers, consistent state and city fiscal troubles make such guarantees non-viable. <p>
<dd>In the end, we don't wish to play the part of party spoilers.  We believe New York City should pursue the 2008 Olympic summer games -- and even Lake Placid the winter games of 2022 -- with two provisions: 1) no taxpayer dollars or guarantees should be utilized, and 2) after the games, Olympic venues should be privatized.  After all, the state should be eliminating its Olympic Regional Development Authority, not expanding such a boondoggle. <p>
<dd>The summer Olympics of 2008 in the Big Apple, and the winter games of 2022 back in Lake Placid, are intoxicating ideas.  If taxpayers are not tapped, then C&K looks forward to helping the cause for bringing Olympic sailing contests to the waters around the Statue of Liberty, gold-medal baseball to Manhattan's west side, tennis to Flushing, and perhaps bobsledding and ice skating again to Lake Placid.  We've got tax-free Olympic fever.
