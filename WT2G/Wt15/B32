<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he most popular outdoor basketball court in New York City is half the regulation 
size, offers no place to sit, and has sidelines bounded by a chain-link fence 20 feet high. 
Those who play here are literally encaged. Yet this ridiculously inadequate court, on 
West 4th Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, has drawn the likes of Denzel 
Washington and Julius Erving for pickup games. And the summer league based here is 
probably the most prestigious in the city. Each year, the West 4th Street League attracts 
more than 30,000 spectators--city-dwellers and tourists--who stand in blistering heat 
just to glimpse their favorite players and snap up league T-shirts at $12 apiece.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street basketball owes its popularity to the inner-city leadership of its 
volunteer commissioner, a limousine driver named Kenny Graham. With little support 
from city hall or local civic groups, he has spent the last 18 summers building the league 
into a New York institution. Lloyd Daniels, Mario Ely, Anthony Mason, Rod Strickland, 
and Jason Williams honed their skills here before going on to N.B.A. careers, and some 
of them still show up during the off-season. Former pros like Detroit's Kelly Tripuka mix 
it up with high-school dropouts.</P>

<H3>Midday Basketball</H3>
<P>	West 4th Street has developed its share of stars, but this is not the league's true 
purpose. In an era of commercialized sports, it is important to understand the 
contributions of a community league composed primarily of players whose glory days are 
over--25- to 35-year-olds with talent and pride, but no N.B.A. contracts. The league and 
its fans cherish players the media overlook, while putting sports and sportsmanship back 
into the community. It is midnight basketball played in broad daylight and without 
government handouts.</P>
<P>	A recent documentary film called <I>Hoop Dreams</I> dramatizes the pathos of the 
nearly-great athlete. William, a high-school phenom from Chicago, ponders his future as 
a scholarship recruit. In the final moments of the film, William reflects on all the people 
who've asked him,  "Will you still remember me when you're a big star in the N.B.A.?," 
and says, "I should've asked them, `Will you still remember me if I'm not?'" Promising 
inner-city players are typically groomed from the age of 12 or so. This process has 
obscured the virtues of athletic competition and replaced them with illusions of easy 
wealth. For a lucky few, lucrative professional careers represent a materialistic triumph 
and escape from the neighborhood.Graham's league, on the other hand, showcases those 
who cannot escape, who must remain behind and make their community work.</P>
<P>	"I started working there refereeing league games for $10 a game," Graham recalls. 
"The next year the league was falling apart and no one wanted to take over, so I decided I 
would be commissioner."</P>
<P>	Founded in 1968, the league had struggled along for several years with only eight 
teams, unreliable funding, and a shortage of referees. Today, Graham runs the oldest 
summer-basketball program in New York City. There is a game every day of the week in 
June, July, and August, five on Saturdays and Sundays. Each year, more than 600 players 
altogether participate in the 24-team men's division, a women's division of six teams, and 
an eight-team division for boys 15 and under. Its prowess is known nationwide. Last year, 
the Summer Pro-League outdoor championship, sponsored by Nike and shown on ESPN, 
was won by the defending champions from New York. But that team, which defeated a 
Chicago squad in the finals by 30 points, had finished second at West 4th Street.</P>
<P>	Youth teams have come from as far away as Seattle and France to play in the 
preliminary games before the seniors begin, but collegiate players rarely play here 
because the league is not sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. In his youth division, Graham 
prefers to work with younger, pre-high-school players, because high-school-age youths 
are often spoiled and difficult to control.   "We have trouble getting teams with 
responsible adults to control the players," he says. "It can be very difficult to talk to them. 
Last summer, we had high-school-age girls' teams, and fighting became a problem. At 
age 13 to 14, the kids will listen."</P>
<P>	The tiny court must hold two referees and 10 quick and often large players, so 
personal fouls proliferate. That makes refereeing difficult. "No one wanted to come down 
there to ref because West 4th Street was very rough," Graham says. "The first year I was 
commissioner, we had only one incident, and I took a stand. The players knew right then 
that I would not walk away from a problem." Arizona Pearson, who has played in the 
league for 11 years and now directs its youth program, has watched Graham keep the 
peace. "Kenny gets in the middle," he says, "but you have to do that, you have to be in 
control. With Kenny, it takes a lot to get him upset. If there's shouting and threatening, 
people apologize afterward."</P>
<P>	The cramped conditions also make ball control extremely difficult. Passing lanes 
are limited, and it is much easier here than in the N.B.A. for a defensive player to 
abandon his man to attack the dribbler or the post-up man waiting to turn and shoot. At 
the same time, the New York style of playground basketball frowns upon the staid jump 
shot in favor of the driving lay-up, with its infinite possibilities for blind pass-offs or shot 
creation. These factors produce a game of ferocious strength, speed, and competitiveness. 
The discipline and control of this style amazes outsiders and accounts for the league's 
popularity.</P>
<P>	West 4th Street smoothes the transition for many of the 98 percent of New York's 
good collegiate players who do not make it to the pros. The close of a competitive career 
can prompt an emotional letdown and demoralize young men with leadership abilities. 
Tony Hargraves was the co-captain of Iona College's basketball team in 1984-85 and was 
named an Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press, but he could not get 
a professional contract. Now an operations manager at Bear Stearns with a home and 
family in the suburbs, he continues to play regularly in the cage. "Good players still have 
a desire to play against people at their own level," Hargraves explains, "and West 4th 
Street offers this." When N.B.A. players show up, regulars treat them with respect, but 
they also relish the chance to show up the pro athletes.</P>
<P>	"The small court makes you do all the right things," Hargraves explains. "It 
improves your game. This is a place where you cannot continue to make mistakes. 
Anthony Mason [a power forward with the New York Knicks] is a prime example. West 
4th Street defined his game. He learned he had to move much more quickly. He became 
one of the stronger players in the city, and now he's one of the stronger players in the 
N.B.A."</P>

<H3>Respect Without Fear</H3>
<P>	I first became drawn to these players in the early 1980s, when I saw in their 
character something missing in the bright young MBAs at our big Wall Street trading 
firm. I saw in young players like Tony Sherman (who still plays) and Mario Ely (who 
won a championship ring with the Houston Rockets last year) awe-inspiring toughness, 
masculinity, and personal pride. These players are courteous but not chatty, fearless but 
disciplined. The better players have grit and a capacity for physical exertion that, I fear, 
our increasingly computerized society seems to devalue.</P>
<P>	Pearson sees the role of competitive basketball in the city quite clearly: "Of 
course it is fun, you can work off frustrations. But it's really about getting respect. That's 
what living in the city is about, you know." At West 4th Street, that means being looked 
up to by others. It's not the same as the fashionable notion of "self-esteem," which is of 
little use on the streets.</P>
<P>   Kenny's idea of respect is not built on fear. "I'm not militant and I'm not a cult leader," 
he explains. "I want people to learn they gain respect if they give respect. That's the 
bottom line.... Often black organizations are poorly run, and I tell players, `When you 
carry on, you reinforce stereotypes. If you make us and the league look bad, we could 
wind up with no league--and then you would have no chance to showcase your talents, 
we want a mutual respect for peers.... And respect for a program and an organization.... 
You can teach respect. I do it by talking, by challenging a person mentally. People judge 
others by their behavior, and I tell people that in their actions they represent their 
heritage, their culture, their race. A lot of so-called black leaders won't challenge black 
people about their behavior. It's easier to tell them [their problem is] white people."</P>
<P>   Fans must arrive early to reserve a good spot at courtside. For big games--the playoffs 
or the all-star game--youngsters sit on the fence or hang from tree branches. Graham or 
one of the staff wits uses a bullhorn to announce the games, and their commentaries are 
humorous, improvisational performances.</P>
<P>	The league has become an integral part of the lives of its 600-plus participants. 
Most of the players do not live in the neighborhood. They come mainly from Brooklyn, 
Harlem, or the Bronx to the playground here because they like to play before the big 
crowds in the Village.</P>
<P>	Sid Jones, a Brooklynite who has been coaching winning teams for 15 years, is 
particularly attuned to the sense of community the league has developed. "Generally, 
people don't spend time getting to know each other, but at this park, you meet people," 
Jones says. "The people you meet may help you in other parts of your life. Kenny and the 
league have been bringing people together for years, and it's now a community. You 
wonder, why can't people get along like this outside of sports? --Just about every 
subway line stops here, so you get people from all walks of life. It's a real melting pot. 
Players will come here when they won't go everywhere else. And I'll tell you, when you 
win a big game down here, you don't want to go home."</P>
<P> 	The city government provides the league nothing except a permit to play. "They 
are not that concerned with us," Graham says, "because they see we are doing OK. They 
are worried about their own programs. Occasionally a mayor will come down here to help 
get some votes. ... But they are not here to help the league."</P>
<P>   Graham never passes the hat. He and a few of his staff were once granted the status of 
part-time employees by the New York City Parks Department, but that was discontinued 
years ago. Money to run the league now comes exclusively from entry fees--$500 per 
team--and corporate sponsors. The principal sponsor for the last two years has been Fila 
Inc., a sportswear manufacturer, which subsidizes uniforms and gives sneakers to each 
team. Since 1986, Nobody Beats the Wiz has provided television sets for the winners of 
the Most Valuable Player and Sportsmanship awards. The nearby McDonald's feeds the 
staff more than 500 free meals each summer. The maker of Olde English 800 malt liquor 
provides a scoreboard and money for trophies and shorts.</P>
<P>	None of the league's successes--its local following, corporate sponsorship, and 
national recognition--would be possible without its reputation for serious, disciplined 
basketball. So Graham insists upon high standards of behavior. A public league held in a 
public park draws all kinds, and no one can be refused admission, but Graham works hard 
to maintain the dignity of the league. Sometimes a player or fan will challenge this. "One 
day right after a game, a guy on one of the teams dropped his pants," he recalls. "I didn't 
think it was funny. I laced into him something fierce. I embarrassed him right on the spot. 
What he did was totally wrong." As commissioner, Graham's decisions are final. If a 
player starts fights or disgraces the league in any way, he is banned for the season.</P>
<P>	Graham is a gifted leader who embodies positive thinking--necessary for 
entrepreneurs, but rare among administrators. Graham also takes great pride in delivering 
what he promises. Once when the TV prizes were held up due to a clerical snafu, he 
didn't hesitate to cover the costs. (Eventually, he was reimbursed.)</P>
<P>	Graham's devotion to excellence and good manners filters throughout the 
neighborhood. Good-humored and charismatic, he can quickly summon dozens of helpers 
to do whatever is needed--keeping score or sweeping the court before games. 
Afterwards, they leave the whole area cleaner than before. In this way, even street people 
become part of the league culture. "We take all kinds," says Graham. "We're all human 
beings. Sometimes people will tell me to get rid of a guy who maybe has a drinking 
problem. I say, if a man has a problem and I can help him, I will. Everybody can't be on 
the level we'd like them to be. Some guys have gone through their whole lives being 
rejected, but I will help somebody who wants to be helped. I can deal with them."</P>

<H3>Creating an Identity</H3>
<P>	Graham is proud of the fact that the league plays a part in the lives of many 
players and staff, even those who do menial work. "Many guys down here are not part of 
anything but a joint or a bottle of wine," he says. "We give them an identity above that 
stuff." Graham, who shuns smoking and alcohol, does not allow even surreptitious 
drinking in the park during games. He has also been known to chase smokers away, even 
though smoking is legal. He feels it creates a bad atmosphere for the kids who come to 
watch. He often reminds players that they are "guests" in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>   Even those who never became professional grow as players and as individuals. One of 
these is Tony Sherman, one of the best players in the league never to enjoy a good prep 
career or go to college. "He used to live down there," says Hargraves. "Every day at 3 
o'clock he'd be there working on his game. He's now a great player, and he's done it 
without a good high school record or any college experience.--At the park he became 
popular and he gained respect. That's a big thing in New York City." Pearson agrees: 
"Sherman's grown a lot. He could have been a troublemaker, but he watches his mouth 
now."</P>
<P>	Graham says Sherman has gradually earned the recognition he craves for his 
talent. He has come to follow the example set by Graham and some of the older players, 
and takes defeats with dignity.</P> 
<P>   "Sherman was once the king of the park," says Graham. "Many guys respected him out 
of fear. Now he's older, he's got responsibilities. I think he's realized that people give 
him respect. It's an important difference."</P>
<P>   Last year, then-Governor Mario Cuomo inaugurated the New York State Midnight 
Basketball League at a celebrity function in uptown Manhattan. The governor told the 
out-of-school, out-of-work youngsters for whom the league was created that "we have 
not done well by you, [but] we'll try to make it up to you." This was not the spirit that 
made West 4th Street.  Graham is not driven by paternalism or guilt, nor even by 
altruism. Like his players, he is motivated instead by a need for personal recognition and 
respect from the players and the basketball community. "It's nice to have people say, `I'm 
glad you're back,'" he says. Players and staff alike seek the rewards that come with 
excellence, not charity. "I tell them you don't have to love me--but you should respect 
me."</P>
<P>	Graham believes that other communities can duplicate the success of West 4th 
Street. First, he says, "develop a following. Develop a symbol. Our symbol is West 4th 
Street, playing in a cage. Our shirts are known all over New York--every kid wants one." 
Second, "develop people with character. You've got to let people know that you don't 
have to be out there, you've got a job and other things in your life. They can't just do 
what they'd like to."</P>
<P>	Sociologists like to point out that chaos and disorder are common aspects of 
malfunctioning inner-city families. One of Graham's greatest talents is for organization: it 
is he, not some government agency, that provides continuity for these New Yorkers. The 
order originates within the community rather than being imposed from without. There are 
lots of Kenny Grahams in every community. If such leaders are encouraged, they will 
come.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">J</FONT></B>ust the other day, it seems, the national debate about the U.S. role in the United 
Nations turned for the most part on the issue of money--on U.S. contributions and U.N. 
waste, and how reducing the former might diminish the latter. That issue remains. In 
1994, the U.S. spent no less than $3.5 billion on a largely dysfunctional U.N. system--
with scant returns as measured by U.S. national interests. (See sidebar.)</P>
<P>	But the debate has a scary new dimension. The U.N. is reinventing what used to 
be called "peacekeeping." In the last several years, that do-good concept has been 
stretched to encompass a range of U.N. operations that typically involve the use of force, 
even the waging of war. Moreover, President Clinton's U.N. representatives are willing 
collaborators in developing a one-size-fits-all justification for multilateral interventions 
that bear only the most attenuated relation to U.S. interests--if any at all.</P>
<P>	And that, along with peacekeeping's mounting bills, adds up to serious business 
indeed.</P>
<P>	It is now the business of the 104th Congress. As a component of its Contract with 
America, the House of Representatives already has passed the National Security 
Revitalization Act, which reins in the wild proliferation of U.N. peacekeeping, limits U.S. 
participation in these operations, and imposes some controls on U.S. contributions to the 
U.N. generally. The next orders of business are to fend off efforts in the Senate to weaken 
these provisions--which constitute only a minimal package--and then to be vigilant 
about implementation. The question still to be answered is what the U.N. is worth to us--
whether, that is to say, the U.S. gets back in national priorities anything commensurate 
with its $3.5 billion annual investment.</P>
<P>	Ten years ago, there was a consensus in the United States that radical surgery was 
called for. Numerous studies and investigations, many of them instigated by the U.N. 
itself, had revealed a pattern of waste, mismanagement, and duplication (see sidebar, page 
66). The U.N.'s socioeconomic agenda called for the redistribution of wealth from the 
industrialized democracies to the less-developed countries of the Third World. On the 
political side, national-liberation movements (good) and colonialism (bad) were the 
buzzwords of choice.</P>
<P>	As a result, a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1984 overwhelmingly approved 
the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment to the authorization of the U.S.'s 25 percent share 
of the U.N.'s administrative budget. The terms of the amendment seemed unambiguous: 
Shape up, impose fiscal discipline on yourself, and move toward some form of weighted 
voting on the U.N. budget in the General Assembly, with "bonus" votes for big 
contributors in rough proportion to their contributions, or else suffer an annual 20 percent 
withholding of the U.S. payment.</P>
<P>	Now, let the record show that Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and 
Representative Gerald Solomon (R-NY) had the right idea then--that the U.N. had to be 
reformed if ever it were to become a useful agent of world order--and it is the right idea 
still. But for the most part, Kassebaum-Solomon failed. Congress is now back at work on 
the problems of a dysfunctional U.N., using the power of the purse as one lever of 
reform. The problems have deepened, however, both in complexity and in their deadly 
import. The U.N. has recently engaged in the promiscuous use of force under the 
authority of resolutions that may violate its own charter, and the Clinton administration 
has been willing, even eager, to plunge into the resulting swamp.</P>

<H3>The Peacekeeping Trap</H3>
<P>	Kassebaum-Solomon <I>redux</I> is embodied in the new House act; and, in the Senate, 
a companion bill covers some of the same ground. Both are reasonable first cuts at 
shaping a long-term policy. U.S. costs and U.N. waste are still at issue. But these bills 
focus on U.N. peacekeeping--which is itself a misnomer, and a dangerously misleading 
one.</P>
<P>	The U.N. peacekeeping budget and its expansive peacekeeping agenda are 
escalating out of control. In 1994, the U.S. was assessed almost $1.2 billion for what the 
U.N. calls peacekeeping operations. (The U.S. share is supposed to be fixed at 30.4 
percent, but in fact has crept up to 31.7 percent.) On top of that, the U.S. volunteered in-
kind operational support services--ranging from air- and sealift to armored personnel 
carriers to state-of-the-art communications and intelligence assets--that are valued in the 
House bill's "findings" at $1.7 billion in 1994. (Sources within the national-security 
establishment set their value at close to $2 billion. The administration claims that a major 
part has been reimbursed, but exactly how much is unclear.) These costs were skimmed 
off U.S. defense appropriations that were never intended for peacekeeping or any other 
U.N. program.</P>
<P>	This has contributed to a state of unreadiness in the U.S. military. Appearing 
before a House appropriations subcommittee on January 25th, General John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Defense Secretary William 
Perry conceded as much. They attributed about half of a $2.6 billion defense 
supplemental request to "unanticipated" U.N. peacekeeping costs: $600 million for Haiti 
alone, another $312 million for Bosnia, and lesser amounts for other operations.</P>
<P>	As recently as 1990 or 1991, U.N. peacekeeping was pretty much just that: the 
assignment of ad hoc U.N. forces to monitor truces, police cease-fires, and provide 
buffers between contending parties. These forces prided themselves on scrupulous 
neutrality, and were deployed with the agreement of the parties. The models were 
Kashmir, Cyprus, Lebanon, or the Sinai (where it all began in the 1950s). These were the 
renowned Blue Helmets, drawn from the armed forces of smaller countries (such as Fiji, 
Ghana, Ireland, and Norway); they collectively and deservedly received two Nobel Peace 
prizes. The U.N. peacekeeping budget was appropriately modest and generally 
predictable from year to year. A decade ago, the entire U.S. contribution to the U.N. for 
all programs was less than the U.S. assessment for peacekeeping alone in 1994 
(excluding the "free" support services).</P>
<P>	But now U.N. peacekeeping means almost anything--feeding the hungry, 
responding to "911 calls" (Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's favorite 
formulation), holding elections, building national infrastructure--that the U.N. wants it to 
mean. And this is a U.N. that is avidly seeking "new" missions in the post-Cold War 
world.</P>
<P>	In Cambodia, peacekeeping meant preparing for "free and fair" elections in what 
essentially remains a war zone. Yet the Vietnam-controlled regime that lost the elections 
is still effectively in power. Cost: in excess of $2 billion.</P>
<P>	In Somalia, peacekeeping meant pacifying warring tribal factions, then feeding 
the war's innocent victims, then (unsuccessfully) running the principal warlord to ground. 
Now the warring factions are back at it. Cost: $1.5 billion and counting, plus 30 
Americans and scores of other troops dead. In Haiti, peacekeeping meant invading a 
sovereign country (without opposition or casualties, fortunately) to restore a deposed 
president. With operational control now passing from the U.S. to the U.N., there are 
disquieting signs that violence could resume. Cost: as much as $1 billion so far, and no 
telling how much more for how much longer (one estimate is about $180 million for the 
next six months).</P>
<P>	In Bosnia and Croatia, peacekeeping has become surreal. A force of almost 
25,000 keeps open supply lines to civilian populations--whenever the Serbs choose to let 
the convoys through. The U.N. command has demarcated various "safe havens," which 
the attacking Serbs have violated with impunity. Retaliatory NATO airstrikes, which 
require U.N. concurrence, have been too little, too late. This U.N. peacekeeping force 
cost more than $1 billion in 1994. A "peace-enforcement" operation of open-ended 
duration, with peace nowhere in sight, may require at least 50,000 troops at an annual 
cost of $3 billion. The recently retired U.N. commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose of the United Kingdom, may have said more than he intended in a BBC 
documentary: "We are not here to protect or defend anything other than ourselves or our 
convoys."</P>
<P>	The point is not that these U.N. operations are all without merit. But all of them 
were set in motion under Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter as responses to "threats 
to peace and international security"--and, except for Bosnia, where even the U.N. claims 
only a "humanitarian" mission, not one of them meets that rigorous standard. They are of 
questionable legitimacy, and the U.S. picks up 31.7 percent of the tab.</P>
<P>	Besides paying the biggest share of the bills, the U.S. has acceded to all of these 
operations as one of the Security Council's permanent five. In Haiti and Somalia, the U.S. 
committed armed forces as well. Right now, anywhere from 50,000 to 70,000 U.S. 
military personnel are assigned to U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Exactly how many is 
in dispute. The House puts the number at 70,000; Perry testified to "just under 50,000" as 
of late January.) Some are serving in war-zones, some are off-shore or in aerial 
surveillance and interdiction missions, some are in support roles. But all are serving 
under the authority only of U.N. Security Council resolutions as implemented by the U.S. 
commander-in-chief.</P>

<H3>What Can Be Done?</H3>
<P>	This is the range of problems that Congress now confronts. The bills pending in 
Congress address the issue of U.S. contributions to an open-ended U.N. entitlement 
program in the guise of peacekeeping. But they also raise a genuine constitutional issue: 
the commitment of U.S. armed forces--arguably, the ultimate exercise of public 
authority--without the explicit consent, or even involvement, of Congress.<P>
</P>	The House act passed in February inhibits, but does not prevent, the president 
from engaging U.S. armed forces in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and in particular from 
putting U.S. forces under "foreign" and/or U.N. command. (In the latter case, the U.S. 
officers in direct command of U.S. troops would retain the right to report to and to appeal 
any orders they receive to "superior U.S. military authorities." The president, moreover, 
would have to state in a prior legal memorandum to Congress the grounds for believing 
that such an action is not a violation of the Constitution; the burden of proof is on the 
president.) The president has to give Congress 15 days prior notice of any action 
contemplated or, in an emergency, report within 48 hours afterward. The president has to 
justify the action taken as "necessary to protect national security interests of the United 
States," and project as best he can both the cost and the duration of the operation. These 
requirements should have a chilling effect on the president's propensity to undertake such 
commitments lightly. One can only wonder, had this been the law at the time, how the 
president would have justified our engagements in Somalia or Haiti, and on the grounds 
of what "essential" U.S. national interest.</P>
<P>	There is more. The House act makes it very difficult indeed to fund any expansive 
U.N. peacekeeping operations at all, especially new ones. Effective October 1, 1995, 
there is to be a 25 percent cap on the U.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping--period. 
Moreover, no defense appropriations can be used for any U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping, whether assessed or voluntary: All contributions have to be funded 
explicitly, from earmarked appropriations. Finally, the president is required to present an 
annual accounting of the "fair market" value of all voluntary in-kind contributions 
provided to the U.N. in the prior year and, unless reimbursement is received, offset the 
total "incremental" cost of these contributions against the U.S. assessment for the year 
ahead.</P>
<P>	The loophole opened here, and it's a huge one, is the definition of "incremental." 
Presumably the base pay of U.S. military personnel would be the same whether or not 
they served in a U.N. peacekeeping operation. But what about tanks and jeeps and 
aircraft, or air- and sealift? How in such cases are add-ons computed, as against the 
"base" cost of the U.S. military establishment's sophisticated hardware? And how are 
costs assigned to wear and tear on the U.S. forces as well as to providing necessary 
downtime and retraining? The proof of this effort to restrain peacekeeping costs will 
depend on the rigor with which the test is applied. Chairman Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) of 
the House Committee on International Relations estimates that the offset will be in the 
range of $300 million to $400 million, rather than the $1.7 billion for total voluntary 
contributions in 1994.</P>
<P>	In his first address to the U.N. General Assembly, in September 1993, President 
Clinton said that he favored a 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping assessments and that 
the U.N.--and he might have added, the U.S. representatives there--would simply have 
to learn to say "no" to all but the most urgent requests for "peace" operations. The bills 
now in Congress take him at his word.</P>

<H3>How Not to Reform the U.N.</H3>
<P>	It is instructive to recall the lessons of the Kassebaum-Solomon experience. No 
sooner had the amendment taken effect than the ranks of the U.N.'s leadership were filled 
with born-again reformers. The fewer the U.S. dollars, the greater their zeal. The then-
Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, appointed a select experts' committee that 
very nearly--the Soviets said "no" at the last minute--recommended a major U.N. 
restructuring that would have satisfied about 99 percent of the amendment's intent. The 
experts' committee was able to enact the requirement that the administrative budget could 
move from committee to the General Assembly plenary only by consensus. This 
consensus procedure amounted to a U.S. veto on the U.N. budget.</P>
<P>	But a veto is only as good as the will to use it. Budget growth in the following 
two years was held to zero, but not a finger was laid on the waste, duplication, and 
overlap, nor on the obsolete programs that beset the U.N. then, and still do. On the basis 
of that two-year record, the president--Ronald Reagan himself--certified to Congress 
that the "spirit" of Kassebaum-Solomon had been satisfied, and full U.S. funding 
resumed.</P>
<P>	The U.N. paid no price at all for the endemic inefficiencies and uncontrolled 
spending that gave rise to the congressional reforms in the first place. The dollars that 
were withheld are now being paid up. These are the very "arrearages," in fact, that have 
fueled charges that the most generous contributor to the U.N. is the world's number one 
deadbeat.</P>
<P>	There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this experience. First, merely 
focusing on the process by which the administrative budget is adopted is not enough. The 
loophole of "going along" is too big, and offers too easy a way out. Second, the budget 
itself is not quite the issue: the programs funded by the budget, and the priorities among 
them, have to be scrutinized year after year. Finally, for any U.N. reforms to take firm 
hold--which calls for a persistent effort by the U.S., leading a coalition of the like-
minded within the U.N.--the president and Congress have to be reading off the same 
page. Most of the job, in fact, has to be done by presidential appointees and the 
permanent bureaucracy responsible to them. Congress can (and should) establish the 
benchmarks; but, in the absence of determined executive action, nothing much will be 
accomplished.</P>

<H3>Tightening the Screws</H3>
<P>	This time around, Congress is considering sterner measures: a stronger version of 
last year's Pressler amendment. Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) tied full U.S. funding of 
U.N. operations to the president's certification that an independent U.N. Office of 
Inspector General was up and running. This, in turn, was a follow-up to the key 
recommendation of the Thornburgh Report, in 1992-93, that an inspector general with 
clout was essential to jump-start meaningful U.N. reform. The House act requires the 
withholding of 50 percent of the U.S. peacekeeping assessment and all voluntary 
contributions every year, as well as 20 percent of the regular assessment, pending the 
president's annual certification that an independent U.N. inspections office is in operation 
and that the inspector general has been chosen on the basis of professional credentials, 
has subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records, issues annual and unexpurgated 
public reports, and that the inspector general's recommendations are being implemented.</P>
<P>	Congress, for its part, has to be prepared not to take "yes" for an answer. The best 
way for the U.S. to save money is for the U.N. not to waste it--and that means probing 
behind the numbers to the U.N. programs that ought to be trimmed back, or zeroed out, or 
rejected in the first place. Congress must be on the right track, because administration 
witnesses are already warning of the imminent collapse of the West--maybe even of 
U.N. peacekeeping as we now know it--if this total legislative package is enacted. And 
that, of course, is the point.</P>
<P>	I would add two modest proposals to the package. First, the U.N. ought to 
overhaul the present scales of assessments. Congress should require the president to open 
negotiations at once to revise both the administrative and peacekeeping assessment scales 
within one year. Capping the peacekeeping assessment at 25 percent is only a start: all of 
the allocations, which are supposed to correspond to the GNPs of the U.N. members, are 
hopelessly out-of-date. Russia, for example, pegged at 10 percent for the administrative 
budget and 11.5 percent for peacekeeping, pays too much. China, on the other hand, 
which claims a GNP in excess of $2 trillion, pays less than 1 percent on both scales. The 
spread overall is from 25 and 30.4 percent for the U.S. (for the administrative budget and 
peacekeeping, respectively) to one-hundredth of 1 percent for 85 countries--close to a 
majority of the U.N.'s total membership of 185. Saudi Arabia and Brunei are ranked 
equally with Benin and Bangladesh.</P>
<P>	A second proposal refers to the sidebar on "The High Cost of U.N. Membership": 
What in fact do we spend on the U.N., on all of its various parts, including also the value 
of the in-kind voluntary services that the U.S. routinely contributes? No one, as best I've 
been able to determine, keeps an authoritative ledger; someone ought to. Congress should 
require that the president submit an annual, comprehensive U.S./U.N. budget request. 
That way, we might better be able to answer the question with which we began.</P>

<H3>What Is the U.N. Worth to Us?</H3>
<P>	On balance, I believe the answer has to be "not much." Even if the U.N. were to 
be substantially reformed--which in my judgment is very unlikely--the answer would be 
only slightly more upbeat.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is what we made it. There is little evidence that, in the late spring of 
1945, the U.N.'s founders had any inkling of the proliferation of mini-states that would 
result from the breakup of the colonial empires in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
Simply gathering together all the countries in the world into one grand and ill-assorted 
institution did not then, and does not, now constitute a "community" at all, and certainly 
not a community of like-minded liberal democracies with a consensus on how to design 
and maintain the framework of a tolerable world order. Yet that is the fundamental 
premise built into the U.N. Charter--which today is essentially a fraud.</P>
<P>	At least half, and as many as two-thirds, of the U.N.'s 185 members should, on 
the Charter's own principles, either be expelled or suspended. Yet they comprise a 
working majority of the U.N. General Assembly. They adopt the budget, allocate 
resources, and permit a significant part of these resources to be wasted. Much of the 
waste, as noted already, is on redundant socioeconomic programs that they perceive to be 
beneficial to themselves; the rest pays for plum jobs in the Secretariat for their own elites. 
The fact that these programs do more harm than good, by confirming them in their bias 
toward statism, cuts little ice. The U.N. is their organization. Not surprisingly, they use it 
in their own interests.</P>
<P>	Now, it will be objected that all this is beside the point, that the General Assembly 
itself is beside the point: simply a shadow-play, in which the mini-states debate toothless 
(if often mischievous) resolutions that nobody heeds. Subsidizing this exercise is, so the 
argument goes, the price we pay for maintaining a functioning U.N. when we need it.</P>
<P>	"When we need it": This always is the mantra of last resort. It apparently refers to 
those "threats to peace and international security" to which only the U.N. Security 
Council can respond with force or the threat of its use. Thus Warren Christopher argued, 
in vigorously opposing the limits on U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping, that their 
effect would be to force the U.S. to "go it alone." It's either the U.N., such as it is, or 
isolation. But "going it alone" looks not so bad, if it means standing aside from, even 
vetoing, ill-defined, open-ended "peace" operations that arguably exceed the U.N.'s 
authority and certainly exceed its capabilities or demonstrated competence. Secretary 
Christopher may make unapologetic isolationists of us all.</P>
<P>	In some circumstances, our government's own judgment of the national interest 
may coincide with U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating forceful responses to 
"threats to peace." North Korea's invasion of the South was one such circumstance, 
Iraq's aggression against Kuwait another. But in both cases, it was the prior U.S. 
judgment, and its firm commitment to resist aggression, that carried the day in the 
Security Council. The U.S. and its like-minded allies would have taken the actions they 
deemed necessary, with or without the cover of U.N. resolutions. It may well be, in fact, 
that the U.N. served more to inhibit than to unleash the resulting "peace-enforcement" 
operations, and limited their effectiveness as a consequence.</P>
<P>	Looking back over these last 50 years of U.S. national security policies, what is 
most striking is the almost total absence of the U.N. from the historical record. When 
something does matter, whether it is an alliance to deter aggression (NATO) or carrying 
out an effective foreign assistance program (the Marshall Plan) or negotiating the rules of 
free and fair international trade (GATT), the United States invariably has entered into 
multinational engagements with the genuinely like-minded. This should come as no 
surprise. It is the mark of a serious country, seriously pursuing its national interests.</P>
<P>	Most of the U.N.'s success stories have in fact been those of the results-oriented 
specialized agencies--as, for example, the virtual eradication of smallpox (WHO), the 
care and feeding of refugees (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), and the 
green revolution in South Asia (several agencies involved). Many of these agencies 
predate the U.N. itself. And the most successful have been those most careful to insulate 
themselves from the "political" U.N. in New York.</P>
<P>	For now, it is probably enough just to cut back on the U.S. commitment to the 
U.N., to be discriminating in acceding to the use of force in U.N. "peace" operations, and 
to prevent as much costly mischief as possible. The approach being taken by Congress 
seems about right--but no less will do.</P>
<P>	The threat to withhold consensus on the administrative budget, vigorously 
applied, could squeeze a useful amount of fat from the Secretariat. Insisting on an 
independent inspector general is not about to produce a lean and mean U.N. bureaucracy 
overnight, but every little bit helps. In the specialized agencies, picking and choosing 
among programs worth supporting--as we do in UNESCO, even as a non-member--
makes a lot of sense. A runaway Security Council calls for particular vigilance, and an 
ever-ready veto, which the total package of congressional limitations should satisfy--yes, 
Mr. Secretary, even at the risk of "going it alone."</P>
<P>	I fear that putting the U.N. out of its misery altogether would incur unacceptable 
costs. The predictable firestorm among our allies would weaken relationships that are far 
more important to us than the U.N. itself. It may be cowardice, or it may simply reflect 
the enormous effort involved in fundamental U.N. reform for a rather modest payoff. But 
I would settle for putting the U.N. back in its box and keeping our eye on it. A wary eye, 
and a parsimonious one.</P>

<H3>The High Cost of U.N. Membership</H3>

<P>	Somewhere in the United States Budget for Fiscal Year 1996 there is an entry for 
just about everything, from midnight basketball to research on the reproductive cycle of 
fruit flies. But search as you will, nowhere in that huge tome that documents the roles and 
responsibilities of $1.6 trillion's  worth of national government is there a total for 
projected U.S. contributions to the United Nations.</P>
<P>	The U.N. is not exactly a new kid on the block. It will celebrate its 50th birthday 
this June; and after tens of billions of dollars in U.S. contributions over the years, it might 
be supposed that someone would want to assess the value to us of membership in this 
multinational conglomerate. A total annual budget figure would help.</P>
<P>  To get started on such an evaluation, here are the numbers for the 1994 calendar year, as 
best as I have been able to put them together:</P>
<UL><LI>  The U.S. share (25 percent) of the U.N. administrative budget, which funds all 
Secretariat staff and programs: $298 million.
<LI>  The U.S. share (31.7 percent) of the peacekeeping budget: $1.2 billion.
<LI> U.S. contributions to all U.N. specialized agencies (World Health Organization, Food 
and Agriculture Organization, High Commissioner for Refugees, et cetera): $368 million, 
exclusive of capital contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</UL>
   Cumulative total: almost $2 billion.<BR>
<P>   This total does not include the value of goods and services that the U.S. contributes 
voluntarily to the U.N. system as a whole. For U.N. peacekeeping operations alone, 
voluntary contributions in 1994 represented about $1.7 billion in "fair market" value, and 
some sources put the total in excess of $2 billion. (The administration claims some of this 
total has been reimbursed, but does not say how much.) For other programs, a reasonable 
estimate is even more difficult for an outsider, but there is a steady flow of experts from 
the Washington bureaucracy to U.N. headquarters, and similar ties with the specialized 
agencies. Add in these numbers, and the total approaches $4 billion.</P>
<P>	That isn't small change. Now that we know roughly what membership costs us, 
the question we need to answer: What does our investment in the U.N. buy us?</P>


<H3>The U.N.'s Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	In 1992 and 1993, former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh served as 
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management with a specific 
mandate to evaluate the U.N.'s effectiveness. After a year on the job, he prepared a report 
on U.N. mismanagement and waste and tried repeatedly to galvanize the secretary general 
into effective action. In frustration, he went public with his recommendations and 
testified on March 5, 1993 before the House Subcommittee (of International Relations) 
on International Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. Here are some 
highlights of his report and testimony:</P>

<B>Inspector General.</B> Key recommendation: to uncover "waste, fraud, and abuse" within 
the Secretariat, an independent, professional Inspector General has to be named, with full 
subpoena power over U.N. personnel and records.<BR>
<B>Peacekeeping Field Operations.</B> A McKinsey & Co. management audit uncovered no 
less than $100 million in annual waste owing to duplication and overlap, managerial 
incompetence, and lack of communications within the field structures.<BR>
<B>"Featherbedding."</B> One example: 500 typists employed to transcribe the dictation of 
translators. Use of basic word processors would save about $20 million a year.<BR>
<B>Financial Management.</B> McKinsey & Co. recommended improvements in foreign 
exchange transactions, centralization of cash management, and automated payments. 
Projected annual savings: $12 million to $15 million.<BR>
<B>Career Service.</B> Nearly 90 percent of all staff assessments are positive. As Thornburgh 
notes, not only does incompetence carry no penalty, there is no incentive for meritorious 
service. Top jobs in the U.N. Secretariat are compensated up to 150 percent of 
comparable U.S. supergrades--and it's all tax-free.<BR>
<B>"Consultants."</B> Although it is in violation of the U.N.'s own regulations, top bureaucrats 
are routinely "retired" (with lump-sum separation pay up to $500,000) and then 
immediately rehired as "consultants" at 85 to 100 percent of previous pay.<BR>
<B>Procurement.</B> In 1990-91, of 5,450 contracts let, only 17 percent were put out for 
competitive bidding, contrary to U.N. regulations for all except "emergency" cases.<BR>
<B>Printing.</B> About two-thirds of all printing needs are generated during the annual three-
month General Assembly. Yet the print shop is fully staffed year-round. Contracting out 
during peak times would, according to Thornburgh and a 60 Minutes investigation 
(broadcast September 20, 1993), save "tens of millions" annually.<BR>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT></B>arents and politicians tend to blame the education establishment for the sorry 
state of learning in American public schools. The educrats are not taking this lying down. 
They've found their own scapegoat: parents. Public-school boosters have decided that lax 
parental involvement is the reason children fail. And so some have begun turning the 
schools into Big Mother.</P> 
<P>	The newest trend in education "reform" is the inclusion of parental-education 
programs and curricula that require parental involvement in student activities. President 
Clinton's Goals 2000, enacted last year, includes an entire section on "parental 
assistance," also called "parent training." Some schools even require parents to sign a 
pledge that they will perform assigned, pseudo-educational tasks, which could include 
playing "Simon Says" or rolling cookie dough with their third-grader.</P>
<P>	Of course parents should be involved in their children's education. And, of 
course, problems at home--messy divorces, absent fathers--can cause problems for 
children at school. But the "parent education" movement seeks to blame all parents for 
academic failure, not just parents who are neglecting their kids or destroying their own 
families. The movement does not seek to make parents more demanding of their children, 
nor, no surprise, of the schools. To the contrary, new curricula urge parents to be 
nurturing and uncritical--sort of the way public-school officials would like parents to 
treat them.</P>
<P>	This philosophy is becoming institutionalized in California. Consider the math 
curriculum rated most highly--a perfect 100 percent--by a state education panel that 
chooses which textbooks should qualify for state subsidies. "Investigations in Numbers, 
Data and Space," from the Dale Seymour Publications Series, appealed to the panel 
because it included home assignments that require parental involvement.</P>

<H3>New New Math</H3>
<P>	Under this curriculum--call it New New Math--which eschews rigorous 
memorization of multiplication tables, teachers send home periodic "Dear Family" 
missives to third-grade parents with the following advice:</P>
<UL><LI>  "Don't worry if your child doesn't use a ruler accurately yet--it's a skill that will 
develop over time, with more and more opportunities to measure."<BR>
<LI>  "Children have very interesting ways to figure out these problems. You can help by 
asking your child to tell you how he or she got an answer. There are many ways to do 
these problems--and no single `right' way. What's important for your child to know is 
how his or her own way works."<BR>
<LI>  "When your child has an assignment to do at home--such as collecting data about the 
ages of pets and oldest relatives--offer your help, and ask your child about what he or 
she is doing in class."<BR>
<LI>  "There is one thing we ask you not to do. We won't be using some of the step-by-step 
methods of addition and subtraction in this unit that may be familiar to you--nor will we 
be teaching borrowing or carrying. All too often, we have found that children this age 
memorize these step-by-step procedures and do not learn how to apply the processes of 
addition and subtraction. This year we will support students in developing several 
strategies for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and we prefer that they do 
not memorize a single set of procedures."</UL>

<H3>Educational Relativism</H3>
<P>	This New New Math adds up to a new way of letting schools off the hook for not 
teaching children. It's not enough that we have moral relativism in English and Social 
Studies. Now we have it in math, too.</P>
<P>	The Dale Seymour third-grade program instructs parents to "make roll-out 
cookies with your child" to explore shapes, include children in family math decisions 
(such as how many floor tiles to buy) and explore "fair shares," which is politically-
correct educratese for "sharing food." Clearly the intent of these instructions is to force 
parents to spend quality time--at least as defined by educrats.</P>
<P>	So what's wrong with that? Supporters argue that parents, especially single 
parents, may not spend enough quality time with their children and would benefit from 
programs that nudge them to do so. But not all parents need this nudge, and some object 
to the schools' sledgehammer approach. And many may object to a pervasive touchy-
feely, there's-no-such-thing-as-a-wrong-answer attitude being foisted upon parents.</P>
<P>	In Petaluma, California, a mandatory high-school course called Human 
Interaction, or HI!, has provoked an angry reaction from some parents.</P> 
<P>	They resent take-home assignments that tell them how to be parents. The 
program's take-home and in-class "teen/parent" worksheets have included these queries 
for ninth-graders:</P>
<UL><LI>  Whether "how much money your parents make" is a private issue or can be discussed in 
class.<BR>
<LI>  Whether any "close relatives" has ever suffered "alcoholism" or "mental illness."<BR>
<LI>  Whether students "feel OK about crying" and "allow" themselves to do so.<BR></UL>
<P>	Other questions explore whether students recycle, eat fast food, use public 
transportation and "accept the way [they] feel about things."</P>
<P>	According to administrators, the course is a hit with kids. You can see why. No 
boring memorization or flexing of the gray cells here. Student assignments encourage 
teens to go with their feelings. "Denying" them, they are told, is passive behavior. A class 
worksheet on "family systems" assures teens that "open" families are "`pure' 
democracy," while "closed" families are "hierarchal."</P>
<P>	Federal law prohibits schools from asking children for highly personal 
information without parents' permission. The district explains that teens are meant to fill 
out the worksheets for their own private use, but at least two teachers in Petaluma told 
students to turn in signed worksheets. And Stephen Collins, the assistant superintendent 
of the Petaluma School District, admitted last fall that, once such worksheets are passed 
out, it is very likely that these topics will be discussed in class.</P>
<P>	Petaluma parents Jay and Tura Avner pulled their two children from HI!. "They 
want to be surrogate parents," Tura Avner complains. She especially resents the district's 
assumption that "unless the schools taught me how to manage my kids, they'd be running 
wild in the streets."</P>
<P>	But the Avners' efforts to liberate their children have not been easy. The district 
would not assign the Avners' son to an alternative, academic class. Instead, he was forced 
to be a counselor's aide for that period. Worse, the district dragged its feet for months 
before granting a "waiver" from this program. So much for "voluntary" parental 
education.</P>
<P>	District administrators sometimes insinuate that dissenters are right-wing religious 
fanatics. These days, that is a standard response to complaints. State law allows parents to 
pull their children from classes for reasons of religious belief or moral conscience. The 
Petaluma district, however, wouldn't let parents remove their children without a fight. 
Last year, the superintendent's cabinet, the district counsel, and HI! officials crafted a 
waiver form requiring parents to list their "reason(s) why they did not want their children 
to attend, and declare that they would provide appropriate alternative educational 
experiences" on HI! topics. This tactic clearly was designed to prompt parents with 
religious objections to proclaim themselves, giving administrators potential grist for the 
anti-fundamentalist mill. Yet California law clearly protects parents' right to keep private 
their reasons for objecting to a class.</P>
<P>	The kicker: Until the Rutherford Institute, a religious-freedom advocacy group, 
threatened a lawsuit, the district proposed that parents sign the waiver forms "under 
penalty of perjury." The penalty for perjury in California is a jail term of up to four years. 
Was the district planning to arrest parents who don't teach their children recycling? "I 
don't know that we were going to do anything," assistant superintendent Collins 
explained at the time. "We knew that when we went into this it was going to be revised."</P>
<P>	Collins was forthcoming in his defense of HI!'s "individual growth, physical 
growth, and social growth" curriculum. It is "pretty generally believed," he said, that 
most parents don't communicate with their children. Then there's the if-schools-don't-
teach-this-children-will-die argument. Collins explained that the board determined that 
HI! "was a matter of life and death." "If students don't have the tools to deal with the 
pressures" and destructive elements in life, he said, the board feared teens "would make 
the wrong choices and it would be fatal."</P>
<P>	This thinking betrays a strong anti-parent bent. Parents, apparently, fail to instill 
their children with self-esteem or AIDS awareness, so the schools must fill the void. 
Educrats have concluded that children who ignore their oafish parents' words on, say, 
safe sex will miraculously heed their teachers. Worse, HI! assumes that teens will build 
more self-esteem by talking about their feelings than by learning to speak a foreign 
language or play a musical instrument.</P>
<P>	Similarly, New New Mathmeisters seem to have a Rousseauesque view that 
children will grasp math intuitively if not distracted by narrow-minded parents or 
teachers. For example, the California math-curriculum panel disapproved of exercises 
that are "generally under the direction of the teacher." That Californian teachers' unions 
have supported this shows how far they have moved from their support of traditional 
pedagogy.</P>

<H3>Why Have Schools?</H3>
<P>	Maureen DiMarco, Governor Pete Wilson's education adviser and a critic of the 
New New Math, is baffled by this natural-learning approach. If kids learn so well by 
themselves, she asks, why have schools? "The assumption that, if children wander 
aimlessly they will automatically find all the prizes that are out there educationally is 
totally ludicrous," she says.</P>
<P>	Despite the rhetoric about parental involvement, administrators favor things that 
parents don't like. A poll by Public Agenda found that 86 percent of respondents want 
students to learn arithmetic "by hand" before they use calculators. But a 1993 survey 
found that 82 percent of math educators thought that "early use of calculators will 
improve children's problem-solving skills and not prevent the learning of arithmetic."</P>
<P>	If educators want parents to be involved in public education, it certainly isn't 
because teachers and administrators value their views. Parents in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and elsewhere complain they have been systematically frozen out of 
power in school-based councils. The message: Be seen and not heard.</P>
<P>	And maybe cough up some money for a field trip, books, or computers.</P>
<P>	New New Math programs effectively freeze parents out in another way. Even as 
New New Math mavens ostensibly increase parental involvement, many new curricula 
don't even include textbooks. "The concept of what they mean by parental involvement 
in these materials implies the parents should be involved," says DiMarco, "but then tells 
parents not to impose their own math learning styles and knowledge on their children. 
And worst of all, when the student doesn't get what is going on in class and the parent 
has to help with the homework, too often the parent will be confronted with only a 
worksheet. There is no textbook that explains the work to be done--leaving the parent 
and the student without another alternative than just the teacher's explanation."</P>
<P>	Sadly, parents are often the first to embrace parental education, even if their 
parents rarely helped them. A generation ago, it was believed that children learned best 
by working through their studies on their own. Somewhere along the way, educrats 
abandoned that notion and began to insist that parents assist with the homework.</P>
</P>	In addition, the proliferation of AIDS, teen pregnancy, and single-parent families 
have led many to demand that schools take on responsibilities that parents 20 or 30 years 
ago would never have dreamed of giving up. Today, the generation that believed in 
questioning authority is asking the authorities to raise their kids.</P>

<H3>Wrong Target</H3>
<P>	Brace yourselves--things may grow worse. Petaluma has begun a pilot program 
for grade-school counseling called SUCCESS, an acronym for "Self Understanding Can 
Create Everlasting Secure Selves." Counselor Susi Brodie told the <I>Petaluma Argus-
Courier</I> that counseling children often involves counseling parents.</P>
<P>	Big Mother's attention wrongly falls upon functioning families. Neglectful 
parents aren't going to roll out the cookie dough to teach shapes; only families who 
already bond with their children will. Troubled students largely lack structure, not 
attention.</P>
<P>	Two years ago, I rode in a van operated by the San Juan Unified School District, 
in Sacramento. The 35-foot van housed the district's mobile Student Attendance Review 
Board (S.A.R.B.). According to Carolynn Salter, the district's child welfare and 
attendance counselor, the district purchased a van for S.A.R.B. hearings because parents 
frequently failed to show up for their children's truancy hearings.</P>
<P>	The four students the van visited that day were in elementary school. One 
kindergartner had missed 57 days, while his second-grade sister had missed 66. Their 
prognosis was frightful: They were both to be kept back a grade. The boy couldn't even 
use scissors.</P>
<P>	Schools and government should intervene in such clear-cut cases of severe child 
neglect. But Big Mother does not have the stomach to deal with these messes. A bill 
sponsored by the late B.T. Collins, a GOP assemblyman, that would have ended welfare 
benefits for parents with truant children never made it out of committee.</P>
<P>	Instead of getting tough with parents who don't provide their children with basic 
needs--nutrition, shelter, education, stability--the schools have turned their attention 
where it is needed least. </P>
<P>	They target parents who provide for their children and are well-meaning and 
gullible enough to be taken in by faddish curricula. The parental-involvement movement 
seeks to teach parents to  value self-esteem over academics. This is a clever ploy by a 
system that is shortchanging American children. </P>
<P>	As happens in so many areas these days, the government is treating good people 
like bad people, while letting the worst problems fester.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT></B>f 1992 was the "Year of the Woman" in American politics, then 1994 was the 
"Year of the Conservative Woman." Nine women incumbents--all liberal Democrats--
lost their House seats in the November elections. Seven conservative Republican women 
were elected to the House freshman class, while moderate Republican Olympia Snowe 
moved from the House to the Senate.</P>
<P>	The new Republican women in the House do not claim sisterhood with the so-
called "women's agenda." Instead, they define the GOP's Contract with America as a 
"women's issue," and their campaigns centered on tax cuts, congressional reform, and 
reducing or eliminating scores of government programs and entire agencies. Sue Myrick, 
a two-term mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, was named to the House Budget 
Committee because of her experience controlling municipal spending. She's also a co-
chairman of the GOP "freshmen task force" to eliminate the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. Since the mid-1960s, she says, HUD and other federal agencies 
have spent $5 trillion on the War on Poverty, and poverty won.</P>
<P>	Barbara Cubin of Wyoming and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho intend to protect 
women and men alike by calling for an overhaul of federal regulation. They've been 
active in the effort to defend property owners from intrusive federal regulators, and to 
give states more flexibility in controlling natural-resources development on public lands 
within their borders. Both Chenoweth and Cubin are on the GOP task force to reform the 
Endangered Species Act to protect animals and plants without jeopardizing jobs or 
property rights. Sue Kelly, of New York's Westchester County, is the only pro-choice 
woman in the crowd, and styles herself an economic conservative. She'll be pushing tax 
and regulatory relief for small businesses.</P>
<P>	These women participate in the first Republican-led Congress in 40 years, which 
offers them unprecedented opportunities for influence. Policy Review looks at three of 
the new lawmakers, who should be on anyone's list of members to watch in 1995 and 
beyond:</P>

<P><B>Andrea Seastrand (CA-22)</B></P>
<P>	For many, the death of a spouse means a time for quitting--a time when long-held 
hopes are wrapped up and put into storage. Not for Andrea Seastrand.</P>
<P>	When her husband Eric, a California assemblyman, died in their 26th year of 
marriage, Seastrand ran for his seat and won. They were a team, "movement 
conservatives" devoted to making government work, by fighting bureaucracy and red 
tape. But it was always Eric who worked in the limelight of elected office. She was 
supportive, in the background, stuffing envelopes and going door to door. "I was the one 
writing the letters and getting others to write," she says. "I never saw myself as the one to 
receive the letters."</P>
<P>	She would be receiving a lot of them. Elected in 1990, Andrea served four years 
in the General Assembly. Then, last year, she saw an opportunity to run for the Santa 
Barbara-area congressional seat vacated by Michael Huffington in his bid for the U.S. 
Senate. She ran on the Contract with America and immigration reform, calling for 
speeding up the deportation of illegal aliens convicted of and imprisoned for serious 
crimes. She supported Proposition 187--the state ballot initiative to end state services to 
illegal immigrants--because she thinks legal aliens are most likely to play by the rules 
and build lives for themselves and their families. "I'm a believer in immigration--legal 
immigration," she says. "I want to help people who are here legally to work through the 
red tape to become citizens more quickly."</P>
<P>	Seastrand's political education began at the all-girls Catholic high school she 
attended in Chicago. During a visit to the school, a bishop who had been exiled from 
Lithuania explained what communism meant in his country, and described the deadening 
effect of a totalitarian government on its citizens. The experience made the 15-year-old 
staunchly anti-Communist. The nuns at school gave Seastrand what might be called a 
practical civics lesson: "No matter where you come from, no matter what your 
background, if you use your God-given abilities and talents, and work hard, the sky is the 
limit to what you can achieve." This simple principle has affected her views on 
everything from welfare reform to school choice.</P>
<P>	The former elementary-school teacher learned another lesson from her nuns: The 
importance of living by example, of mentoring young people in basic conservative values 
of family and citizenship. Fulfilling a promise with her husband, Andrea has continued 
"adopting" students, taking them under her wing for national conventions and boosting 
their involvement in civic life. Her students typically serve as interns in her office, 
community volunteers, and political and neighborhood activists. One of the students she 
took to the Republican National Convention in 1984 is now her congressional district-
office director. An immigrant from Mexico who once served as an intern is now a Wall 
Street banker. Another former intern is a lobbyist in California for a transportation trade 
association.</P>
<P>	Shortly after the death of her husband, Andrea established the Eric Seastrand 
Memorial Youth Fund, using her skills at grassroots political organizing for non-political 
community-outreach projects. Her fund has benefitted dozens of students by providing 
scholarships, supporting 4-H programs, buying a wheelchair to enable a child to 
participate in the Special Olympics, and supplying train tickets for grade-school field 
trips.</P>
<P>	Like most freshman Republicans, Seastrand's immediate objective is to pass all 
provisions in the Contract With America. But her top legislative priority is to free the 
commercial space-launch industry from the bureaucratic maze of regulation by 
overlapping agencies. She's sponsoring a bill that would create a single agency for 
oversight and regulation, and permit tax-exempt bonds to fund the conversion of obsolete 
military bases into spaceports.</P>
<P>	Her plan would require no direct federal expenditures. Seastrand says her bill 
would help the U.S. compete in the global market for commercial launches, and create 
high-tech jobs in a depressed area severely hurt by base closures and declining military 
expenditures. As a state legislator, Seastrand successfully pushed through commercial 
spaceport legislation, creating the California Spaceport Authority and the first 
commercial spaceport in the nation at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In Congress, she has 
secured positions on the two committees that would handle this issue: Science and 
Transportation.</P>
	
<P><B>Linda Smith (WA-3)</B></P>
<P>	The House Republican leadership calls her "the woman who wouldn't blink." 
When the House wrangled over the Balanced Budget Amendment, Linda Smith insisted 
that it include a provision to prevent Congress from raising taxes without a three-fifths 
majority vote. It was a daring move for a freshman, for it amounted to a rebellion against 
the leadership of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey. Though the tax-limitation provision 
was part of the Contract, its most vocal supporters soon backed off when it became clear 
that it lacked broad congressional support. But not Smith and a handful of her colleagues. 
They convinced the GOP leadership to promise to vote next year on whether tax hikes 
should require a three-fifths majority.</P>
<P>	This came from a woman who didn't even run for Congress. Ten days before the 
primary in her congressional district in southwest Washington, the leading GOP 
candidate suddenly withdrew. Smith, a state legislator, was persuaded to run as a write-in 
candidate because she had organized a strong grass-roots base of more than 10,000 
volunteers. Smith's volunteers hit the streets and got out the vote. She won the primary as 
the first successful write-in candidate in state history, and then won the general election 
with 51 percent of the vote.</P>
<P>	 During her tenure in the state legislature, Smith launched two successful state 
ballot initiatives. The first, concerning campaign-finance reform, ushered in a new code 
of conduct for incumbent legislators, and outlawed public financing of elections. </P>
<P>	The other, the Taxpayer Protection Act, imposed a limit on state government 
spending, and called for voter approval of tax increases.</P>
<P>	That sort of lawmaking gets noticed in the new Congress: Two weeks after Smith 
came to Washington, Representative Jan Meyers tapped her to be chairman of the Small 
Business Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance. The best way to promote small 
business, she argues, is to get government out of the way. One of her top priorities is to 
reduce capital-gains taxes to lighten the load on small businesses and spur economic 
growth.</P>
<P>	Years spent navigating the federal tax system motivates this agenda: Smith 
worked as a tax planner in Washington state for 16 years, without giving politics much 
thought. In 1983, after a series of tax hikes, Smith watched her state legislature double 
the tax rate on small businesses. That's when she decided to leave the tax-consulting 
business to get into the tax-limitation business. Not only did Smith, with no political 
experience, run for a seat in the state Assembly, but she ran against a veteran in a 
Democratic stronghold--the man who'd cast the deciding vote to raise taxes. Her own 
party assured her that a conservative woman had no chance of getting elected in her 
district. Nevertheless, she won in a landslide. After four successful years in the state 
Assembly, Smith ran for the state Senate against an incumbent considered unbeatable. 
Again, she shocked her political opponents. Her come-from-behind victory helped give 
state Republicans their first legislative majority in 33 years.</P>
<P>	There is no way to explain Smith's political successes outside of her populist 
appeal. She describes her mission in Washington in the simplest of terms: "Clean up 
Congress, get rid of the debt, and secure our future." If Smith sponsors even half as much 
legislation as she shepherded in her home state, she'll be known as one of the most 
reform-minded House members in recent history.</P> 
<P>	In addition to tax reform, she wants to enact a campaign-finance reform plan that 
prohibits the transfer of political funds from one person's campaign to another. She 
believes that candidates alone should be responsible for their fundraising activities. This 
widespread practice, if outlawed, would cut against the grain of all members, regardless 
of party affiliation. It would mean that in a tight race, where an infusion of last-minute 
cash might influence the outcome, a candidate's campaign could no longer receive 
thousands of dollars in surplus funds from another politician's war chest. </P>
<P>	Smith would restrict out-of-state campaign contributions to less than half of a 
candidate's financing. She would subject political-action committees to the same 
restraints currently placed on individual contributors--$1,000 per election cycle, rather 
than the current $5,000. She wants to prohibit incumbents from using the congressional 
frank for mass mailings of constituent newsletters within three months prior to an 
election. Believing that politicians have the million-dollar advantage over their 
challengers--by way of a taxpayer-funded congressional budget--Smith contends that 
bulk mailings unfairly boost an officeholder's name identification.</P>
<P>	Smith is not known as a compromiser. Critics say that her stubbornness in 
pushing through her agenda borders on arrogance. Smith, on the other hand, likes to 
remind them that she did not run for office; she was drafted. She says her populist reform 
agenda is part of a larger movement in the newly elected House membership. "Don't 
break the spirit of this freshman class," she warns the GOP leadership. "This spirit is 
what the country needs."</P>

<P><B>Enid Greene Waldholtz (UT-2)</B></P>
<P>	Ever since Utah's Enid Greene Waldholtz was elected to Congress, she has been 
passionately concerned about her job's fringe benefits--she wants to amend, slash, and 
eliminate them. Waldholtz wants all members of Congress to reduce their retirement 
benefits, eliminate automatic pay raises, and roll back their salaries to $89,500--a 31 
percent cut--all in the name of good government.</P> 
<P>	And that's just for starters. She wants Congress to cut its own budget by 25 
percent, return to its former status as a part-time legislature, and restrict the ability of 
lobbyists to wine and dine members and their staffs. "Everything about the federal 
government needs to change," Waldholtz says.</P>
<P>	Her top priority is reform of congressional pensions. Members of Congress now 
receive retirement benefits that are roughly double that of individuals in the private 
sector. Waldholtz has co-sponsored a bill to eliminate the existing plan and replace it with 
a 401(k) employee-contribution plan.</P>
<P>	Talk about putting your money where your mouth is: Waldholtz has declined to 
accept her own congressional pension, and she has refused government-paid health 
coverage. She and her husband will purchase their own coverage until Congress acts on 
meaningful health-care reform, including portability of insurance benefits, for all 
Americans. She is also trying to figure out how to reduce her annual salary or funnel the 
difference between her current pay and her proposed salary toward charity or reducing 
the debt. She specifically intends to prevent the money from returning to the House 
Speaker's slush fund, the current repository of all unspent funds from congressional 
budgets.</P>
<P>	Although critics contend that she is feigning sacrifice, because of her personal 
wealth, she argues that to effect real political change on Capitol Hill, "the government 
must lead by example." She says it is essential that members "show that we are cutting 
our own budget, that we are living under the same conditions and rules that people in the 
rest of the country are."</P> 
<P>	Reform of congressional pay and benefits is vital, says Waldholtz, when Congress 
is asking sacrifices of its constituents in order to control federal spending and eliminate 
the deficit. Waldholtz says voters in her 2nd district of Utah understand the need for 
shared sacrifice; they know the budget cannot be balanced painlessly. "People in my 
district will support reduction in government even if it means fewer benefits to some of 
them," she says, "as long as they know Congress did it in a fair way, that they were not 
unduly penalized, or asked to take more than their fair share of the burden." </P>
<P>	Waldholtz, a longtime conservative on social issues, was a Bush supporter in the 
1980 presidential race who has since become more conservative on fiscal issues as well. 
She is a good listener, has the negotiating skills of a diplomat, and is well respected by 
both conservatives and centrists within the GOP. This is perhaps one reason why Newt 
Gingrich gave her a highly coveted slot on the Rules Committee, the gatekeeping body 
that determines which legislation makes it to the floor for debate. The first freshman 
appointed in over 80 years, she represents a part of a coalition charged with helping to 
shape legislation to appeals to a majority of the Congress.</P>
<P>	When it comes to welfare reform, for example, such a coalition will need both her 
experience and her bargaining skills. While serving as the deputy chief of staff to Norman 
Bangerter, a Utah governor, she served as his liaison for social services and spent a great 
deal of time in welfare offices talking to case workers and welfare recipients. Her 
conclusion: "The current welfare system verges on immoral," she says. "It penalizes 
people for getting married, for holding a job, and for acting responsibly. It also 
encourages recipients to have more children out of wedlock. The system is completely 
backwards, and it traps people in poverty."</P>
<P>	All of these women gained national office through more than hard work, or savvy 
campaigning, or the incompetence of their opponents. They were propelled by a common 
disgust for the status quo in Washington--a disdain shared by an overwhelming majority 
of the voting electorate last November. As Waldholtz puts it, "The federal government 
has created a hostile atmosphere for states, for communities, and for families to take care 
of themselves."</P>
<P>	Undoing this state of affairs is not thought of as an issue on a women's-rights 
agenda. But it has become the central issue for these women, because they see themselves 
not only as women, but as citizens. That may make them our best hope for bringing more 
citizenship, and less tribalism, into our politics.</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the 1992 presidential race, the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop Thinking 
About Tomorrow" became the official anthem of the Clinton campaign. Once in office, 
the new administration lost little time infusing every facet of its domestic agenda with 
concern about the future. But its defense agenda has been curiously immune to long-term 
thinking. Rather than planning for tomorrow, the administration's defense policies reflect 
a disturbing preoccupation with the concerns of the moment.</P>
<P>	This is a dangerous flaw. The record of the 20th century suggests that the present 
period of diminished global tensions will not last, and that major new threats to national 
survival may emerge in the near future. However, the Clinton administration seems to 
assume that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history, at least as far as great-
power threats to national security were concerned. The result is a U.S. defense budget 
that exhibits high levels of consumption and very low levels of investment.</P>
<P>	Both in their rhetoric and in their resource allocations, senior Pentagon executives 
and many congressional Republicans have been preoccupied with "readiness"--the 
ability to fight effectively on short notice. Readiness is a notoriously nebulous concept, 
but in economic terms it translates into consumption: Money is spent to preserve and 
enhance current capabilities rather than prepare for the future.</P>
<P>	Like other forms of consumption, readiness tends to be bought at the expense of 
procurement of new weapons. In inflation-adjusted terms, Pentagon procurement 
accounts now stand at the lowest levels since 1950, the year the Korean War began. The 
$39 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for weapons procurement in fiscal 
1996 constitutes only 16 percent of a defense budget that itself has shrunk to a mere 15.5 
percent of overall federal expenditures. In other words, the Pentagon's planned spending 
on all types of equipment for military services in fiscal 1996 adds up to only 2.5 percent 
of the federal budget--an amount of money equal to about four months' of sales by the

<P>	The Clinton administration contends that this low level of investment is justified 
by a diminished threat and the huge inventory of weapons accumulated during the Cold 
War. It also claims that a planned increase in procurement will lead to "recapitalization" 
of the armed forces toward the end of the 1996-2001 Future Years Defense Plan. 
However, the Pentagon's current predictions for 2001 may not be any more reliable than 
those of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is possible that spending on 
procurement will remain depressed. If that occurs--while high levels of readiness are 
sustained--the armed forces will suffer continued depletion of their weapons inventories.</P>

<H3>Lessons of the Past</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the depletion of capital stocks could coincide with the reemergence 
of threats abroad and a revolution in military technology, creating a situation not unlike 
that of the 1930s. The current debate over national-security needs presents a rather 
distressing spectacle in historical amnesia. The struggle with communism for the past two 
generations has so strongly influenced policymakers that they exhibit little apparent 
capacity for interpreting that experience in a broader context.</P>
<P>	The Cold War was the third occasion in this century when the U.S. mobilized to 
prevent anti-democratic forces from dominating Eurasia. The century began with the 
challenge posed by German imperialism, and barely a generation later the U.S. was at war 
again, this time to defeat fascism. The outcome of WWII then set the stage for the anti-
communist crusade of the post-war period. </P>
<P>	Note that the same pattern repeated itself with each new danger. Regional powers 
gradually accumulated land and resources while the United States was distracted; early 
warnings that a great-power threat was emerging were greeted with widespread 
skepticism; when the threat became urgent, U.S. leaders discovered they were woefully 
unprepared and commenced a hasty mobilization; once the threat passed, the nation 
engaged in an equally hasty demobilization. After a period of relative tranquillity, the 
cycle has repeated itself.</P>
<P>	It is remarkable that the political elite of a world power could experience three 
complete threat cycles in one century and still not grasp the basic lesson that a fourth 
such challenge is likely sometime relatively soon. As Colin Gray, a military theorist, has 
noted, "American policymaking in the national security area tends to be dominated by 
people with a poor sense of the value of history." Whatever the explanation, current U.S. 
defense policies reflect a startling lack of strategic vision.</P>
<P>	For example, the 1993 Bottom-Up Review was conceived by the Clinton 
administration as a comprehensive assessment of military resources and requirements for 
the post-Cold War period. It prudently concluded that U.S. forces should be able to 
successfully prosecute "two major regional conflicts that occur nearly simultaneously." 
And yet nowhere in the document is the historical significance of regional conflicts 
clearly spelled out--that great-power threats to U.S. security typically originate in 
regional aggression not countered in a timely manner. </P>
<P>	From this perspective, the real danger posed by Saddam Hussein in 1990-91 was 
not his violent annexation of Kuwait, for the invasion of Kuwait was no more significant 
than Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 or Germany's remilitarization of the 
Rhineland in 1936. The danger lies in the bolder designs an aggressor might pursue if he 
encounters no resistance.</P>
<P>	History thus provides a compelling reason for being ready to fight. But it also 
teaches that the emergence of aggressive great powers is characteristic of the geopolitical 
landscape, and that unless the United States continually invests in new defense 
capabilities, it may eventually be unable to avoid defeat at the hands of such a power.</P>
<P>	Viewed against this backdrop, the fundamental defect of the Clinton 
administration's defense plan is all too evident: It purchases current readiness at the price 
of future preparedness. When procurement spending is inadequate, high levels of 
readiness inevitably use up weapons for which there are no replacements. Meanwhile, a 
drop in military contracts prompts the production base of the defense industry to atrophy. 
The U.S. thus gradually loses the military and industrial capacity to respond effectively to 
aggression.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration recognizes this problem and therefore has begun to 
plan for the "recapitalization" of the armed forces--an unfortunate appropriation of a 
term usually associated with the restructuring of bankrupt organizations. But the concept 
of bankruptcy may not be entirely misplaced, because administration plans make future 
procurement increases contingent on raising the overall defense budget and realizing 
substantial savings from base closures and acquisition reform. None of these sources can 
be counted on to generate enough money for a sustained surge in investment.</P>

<H3>The "Procurement Holiday"</H3>
<P>	The Congressional Budget Office refers to the current slump in weapons 
purchases as a "procurement holiday." But like Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" 
during the darkest days of the Great Depression, this is merely a pleasant way of 
describing a system on the verge of collapse. The real buying power of the Pentagon's 
procurement budget declined 67 percent between fiscal 1985--the peak year of President 
Reagan's defense buildup--and fiscal 1995. The administration proposes a procurement 
budget of only $39 billion in 1996, which would bring the total reduction from the peak 
in fiscal 1985 to 71 percent. Backlogs in defense contracts are expected to contract 
eventually by a similar amount, forcing many defense contractors to exit the business and 
reducing competition among those who remain.</P>
<P>	No other part of the defense budget has experienced a comparable decline. The 
major categories of weapons-related expenditures correspond roughly with the key stages 
in the product life cycle: research and development, procurement, and operations and 
maintenance. The operations and maintenance budget includes most of the spending 
related to readiness, whereas R&D, together with procurement, constitutes most 
investment spending. All three accounts declined between fiscal 1990 (the year the Berlin 
Wall fell) and fiscal 1995. But procurement shrank from 28 percent of a relatively large 
budget to 17 percent of a much smaller budget. In constant 1995 dollars, procurement 
spending fell in just five years from $94 billion to $43 billion--a 54 percent cut.</P>
<P>	The impact of declining procurement expenditures on the production of major 
weapon systems has been dramatic:</P>
<UL><LI>  In fiscal 1996, the Air Force does not plan to purchase a single fighter or bomber. In 
fact, it plans to purchase no new bombers throughout the 1996-2001 Future Years 
Defense Plan, even though nearly half of its long-range bombers are more than 30 years 
old, and the sole fighter program it has in development (the F-22) has been repeatedly cut 
back and delayed.<BR>
<LI>  The Navy plans to purchase seven ships in fiscal 1996, only a third as many as it 
purchased in 1990. Over the course of the Future Years Defense Plan, it will buy just one 
submarine every other year from its last remaining sub manufacturer, and many observers 
believe the recently authorized CVN-76 will be the last large-deck carrier the service 
procures.<BR>
<LI>  The Army has stopped purchasing main battle tanks, and has no plans to resume 
purchases any time in the next 15 years. It has been unable to find sufficient funding to 
support upgrades to its existing tanks at an economic rate.</UL>
<P>	The Clinton administration argues that reduced levels of procurement are an 
appropriate response to the end of the Cold War, and that the high procurement 
expenditures of the Reagan-Bush years have made it possible to adequately equip 
shrinking military forces without buying new weapons. Senior administration officials 
point out that R&D spending for new weapons technologies has declined only 
moderately, and that when recapitalization commences early in the next century, it will 
not be necessary to replace weapons on a one-for-one basis. They also claim that by the 
time it is necessary to increase procurement, acquisition reforms will make it possible to 
acquire some military systems more quickly and less expensively from commercial 
sources. Finally, they note that a 47 percent real increase in procurement is planned 
between fiscal 1996 and 2001.</P>
<P>	If all of these assertions proved true, there would be little reason for concern. The 
U.S. would presumably be well-positioned for the challenges that might arise in the next 
century. However, the administration's positions obscure as much as they reveal, and are 
based on assumptions that may prove to be unreliable. For example, the same acquisition 
reforms that supposedly will enable the armed forces to buy advanced technologies more 
quickly and cheaply from commercial sources will also facilitate the transfer of those 
technologies to potential adversaries. As the acquisition system places increased 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies with both military and commercial applications, it is 
inevitable that foreign nations will gain greater access to advanced military capabilities. 
Acquisition reform could thus hasten the emergence of new threats.</P>
<P>	The contention that a smaller force structure can be adequately equipped from 
existing weapons inventories has some validity. For instance, the average age of ships in 
the Navy's active fleet is declining despite the low level of new procurement, because 
older ships are being retired in large numbers. However, the administration's own data 
demonstrate that many key military systems are approaching the mid-point of their 
projected lives, and will eventually require replacements. Furthermore, continuously 
depressed levels of new procurement will gradually erode the defense industry's capacity 
to produce those replacements. In the case of the submarine business, the Navy will soon 
be dependent on a single shipyard that is producing only one boat every two years. If 
even one submarine is removed from the production schedule, the supplier base will 
probably collapse.</P>
<P>	The most misleading argument the administration advances is that it is cutting 
procurement while maintaining R&D specifically in order to prepare for future threats. 
That ignores what is being developed and what is actually being procured. In December, 
the administration announced that the Army's highest-priority acquisition program, the 
Comanche helicopter, would be kept in development and not moved forward to 
production. The Comanche is the only truly stealthy aircraft likely to enter the Army 
inventory in the next 20 years, so deferring its production means soldiers will have to 
face future threats in increasingly vulnerable conventional helicopters. Thus the benefits 
of a decade of development are being lost because of a decision not to procure.</P>
<P>	Similarly, the administration is resisting congressional efforts to procure 
additional B-2 "stealth" bombers even though there is extensive evidence that the planned 
force of 20 B-2s and 200 older bombers cannot meet projected operational requirements. 
Opposing further purchases of the B-2 might make sense if a cheaper and equally 
survivable alternative were under development, but it isn't. Instead, the Air Force plans to 
rely on vulnerable B-1s and B-52s to carry out the bulk of future long-range bombing 
missions. Here again, the benefits of a $20-billion development effort are being 
squandered, with no long-term plan for recovery in sight.</P>

<H3>Bad Trade</H3>
<P>	It is obvious that such decisions are not being driven by doctrinal or operational 
considerations. They are dictated by budgetary pressures. The Clinton administration 
apparently has concluded that unless there is a significant increase in defense spending, 
readiness can only be maintained by drastically limiting investment. This is a tradeoff that 
cannot be continued indefinitely because low levels of procurement eventually translate 
into low levels of preparedness. It is a tradeoff that is not only unacceptable, but 
unnecessary. To avoid this trap, the Pentagon must get serious about privatizing military 
support functions.</P>
<P>	In recent years, many private companies have restructured their operations to 
focus on core competencies. By shedding activities that either are not central to the 
organization's mission or can be performed less expensively by others, companies are 
able to emphasize what they do well and thereby improve their efficiency. The 
Department of Defense is overdue for such a restructuring. Although the department has 
undergone considerable downsizing and there is much talk of "reinventing" what 
remains, there is little evidence of greater efficiency. The result is that even in the midst 
of a budget crisis, the Pentagon continues to waste huge amounts of money.</P>
<P>	The defense department lacks market discipline, and exhibits many of the 
managerial defects of a top-down monopoly. That is hardly surprising, because the 
department was established to exercise a monopoly in the application of military power, 
and like the rest of the federal government it is not a product of economic forces. But it 
still can benefit from those forces.</P>
<P>	After WWII, the department accumulated a vast array of support functions--such 
as supply management, equipment maintenance, dependent health care, data processing, 
accounting, and commissaries--that, while necessary to the effective exercise of military 
power, do not need to be performed by the government. One way of freeing up money for 
additional procurement is to gradually privatize those support functions that can be 
provided by private-sector sources.</P>
<P>	The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the federal government 
saves nearly $10,000 every time the functions of a worker are contracted out. On average, 
the government "outsourcing" saves 20 to 30 percent per contract. However, contracting 
out and privatization have been constrained by convention and by concern that critical 
services might not be available from private-sector providers in wartime. There is little 
empirical basis for this concern, and the cost of continuing to make policy as if it were 
valid is staggering. For example, studies of the $15-billion depot-maintenance system for 
conducting weapons repairs have found 25 to 50 percent of the system is unneeded 
capacity. Some outsourcing of depot maintenance already occurs, but complete 
privatization could probably save billions of dollars every year.</P>
<P>	There are numerous other examples of defense support activities that could be 
privatized. About 48,000 civilian and military personnel are engaged in supply and 
distribution activities. Overhead costs for goods delivered by these personnel average 70 
to 90 percent of the value of the goods themselves, a high figure by private-sector 
standards. The transportation, storage, and administrative costs associated with buying 
and distributing spare parts alone is roughly $5 billion per year, not counting the cost of 
the parts. Many private-sector companies have developed advanced inventory 
management and distribution systems that could substantially cut these costs.</P>
<P>	Financial-information systems is another area that could benefit from 
privatization. The Pentagon reported in 1994 that of 28 major audits of its operations in 
the previous year, 26 were unfavorable. During the same year, the department was unable 
to match $19 billion in disbursements to specific contractual requirements, meaning the 
money may have been paid erroneously. The level of unmatched disbursements is all the 
more striking in view of the fact that it requires more than 100 separate transactions for 
the department to issue a single check. Despite all of these steps, many of which 
presumably exist to prevent mistakes, the chief of staff of the Air Force recently said that 
"it would be nice if we knew what actual costs were, but our accounting systems often do 
not perform this simple and reasonable service."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration is striving mightily to "reinvent" the Pentagon's 
financial management systems, but "deinvention" might make more sense. The private 
sector is full of data-management and accounting firms that long ago solved the challenge 
of tracking money within large organizations. Many large firms have turned over their 
day-to-day financial-support requirements to these firms. The Pentagon should seriously 
consider doing the same thing, just as it should consider turning over the post-exchange 
and commissary functions to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>	An example of how greater reliance on the marketplace could reduce defense 
support costs is provided by the General Services Administration's 1991 decision to 
transfer time-urgent delivery functions to FedEx Corp. The General Accounting Office 
estimates that relying on private-sector sources for overnight delivery reduced the 
government's costs by 76 percent. FedEx's performance was such an improvement that 
the Air Force is increasingly relying on private-sector providers for its own deliveries of 
critical spare parts.</P>
<P>	Nobody really knows how much money the Department of Defense might save 
through the wholesale privatization of support functions. But the annual savings could 
eventually be sufficient to sustain higher levels of procurement without cutting readiness 
or force structure. In fact, privatization would have multiple benefits for the procurement 
budget: Not only would it free up funds for weapons purchases, but transferring 
weapons-support functions to the companies that make the systems could also help 
preserve critical industrial capabilities and reduce the overhead costs they charge on 
procurement contracts.</P> 
<P>	If there is a final lesson in all this, it is that there is no substitute for vision, 
whether strategic or managerial. We may not be able to know the future, but we certainly 
can have a reasonably clear idea of what the past tells us about the range of possibilities. 
In the case of defense spending, past experience warns against a prolonged drought in 
investment, particularly when high levels of readiness are gradually consuming existing 
capital equipment. In the case of defense management, past experience dictates that the 
marketplace is the most efficient provider of goods, and that continuing to perform 
support functions within the government reduces the military's capacity to accomplish its 
mission. These are easy lessons to grasp; the question is whether we will have the 
courage to act on them. Investing more in modern weapons while privatizing support 
functions would prove that, for once, we have learned from our past mistakes.</P>

<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Arguments in favor of a prayer amendment are usually based on symbolism rather 
than raw moral reasoning. In truth, moral reasoning can be authentically employed in 
perpetuating either view.<P>
<P>	If this acknowledgement is denied, then the issue becomes a "distraction," as Joe 
Loconte ("Lead Us Not into Temptation," Winter 1995) suggests, with evangelical 
devotion to the cause somewhat "misplaced."</P>
<P>	Inasmuch as school prayer is "symbolic," it mirrors the perception that the moral 
underpinnings of American society are eroding, if not eroded. The more important 
question hence might be: What is the fundamental role of the Christian community in 
contributing to the moral fabric of a wider American culture? </P>
<P>	This wider issue requires a wider strategy than mere constitutional revision at the 
present political time. The common arguments in favor of a prayer amendment are, by 
themselves, unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>	 First, prayer is a recognition that the state is not God. While certainly symbolic of 
a higher truth, it cannot in and of itself guarantee the reverse.</P>
<P>	Second, that sundry societal pathologies are to be found in the schools themselves 
("Prayer surely won't hurt!") may be true, but is not an argument either. It should be 
remembered that civil disorder stems not from exclusion of school prayer, but from 
voluntary exclusion of religion from the lives of America's people. Thus, a prayer 
amendment is at best a poor antiseptic.</P>
<P>	And even when prayer is important to a majority--perhaps as high as 75 
percent--of Americans, the truth of the matter is that if this devotion to prayer were taken 
more seriously and applied in other available contexts, school prayer might be less the 
political issue that it is.</P>
<P>	Some evangelically minded Christians view a prayer amendment as a "jump start" 
approach to cultural rejuvenation. These individuals would contend that cultural renewal 
is long and tedious; what has been fairly rapidly eroded takes much longer to restore.</P>
<P>	Advocates of a prayer amendment, on the other hand, tend to overlook the fact 
that legislation is reflective of wider culture and not vice versa. To invert this moral-legal 
relationship is to miss the broader issues that are facing Christendom.</P>
<P>	In sum, prayer amendment advocates will need the inconvenient reminder that 
they cannot effectively legislate before they have influenced broader culture. One cannot 
change laws before changing people's minds and habits.</P>

<H3>Dumbed-Down Religion</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	A further argument in favor of Joe Loconte's position on prayer in public schools 
clarifies the difference between religiosity and religion. Religiosity in general transcends 
the specifics of the Catholic or Lutheran or Baptist or Judaic or Muslim religions. And it 
is this generalized religiosity that such prayer in public schools embodies--dismissing as 
trivial the truths of the several great religious traditions that thrive in this country.</P>
<P>	Church, synagogue, mosque--everything is interchangeable in such a scheme. 
Perhaps some religions can accept the dumbing down of religious difference. But the rest 
of us who seriously practice our respective, contending, and contentious religions must 
object.</P>
<P>  Public prayer removed from the specific setting of faith, practiced piety, and the 
corporate, sacred community that offers prayer bears little meaning for Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam.</P>
<P>   When there is a "we," it is always the mystical body of Christ assembled in the name of 
Jesus Christ; or it is the holy Israel, speaking to the One "who has sanctified us by his 
commandments and commanded us"; or it is the Nation of Islam.</P>
<P>   True, we worship one and the same God. But to each of us that God is made manifest in 
specific ways. So far as our deeply held faiths insist, those paths to God, laid out by God 
through Jesus Christ or through the Torah or through the Prophet form the royal road.</P>
<P>	Public prayer that ignores or trivializes and marginalizes the specificity of that 
holy faith forms an affront to the God who has become known to us in the details of our 
revealed faiths. Prayer from no one in particular to whom it may concern bears no 
relationship to the divine service that  our several religions conduct.</P>

<H3>Exaggerated Reliability</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	In light ofthe neo-paganism to which so many Americans have pledged their 
allegiance, it may well be that, as Joe Loconte argues, Christians should be wary of 
school prayer. Nevertheless, the author exaggerates the reliability of private conscience 
and underestimates the importance of public, communal expressions of faith.</P>
<P>	It is quite true, of course, that faith coerced is no faith at all, but that does not 
mean that all of public life may safely be cleansed of that faith which informs Western 
Civilization.</P>
<P>	Public forms of expression work on private consciences. It is not true, as Loconte 
suggests, that "rote prayers" and liturgies are mostly empty and meaningless; indeed, 
evangelicals have their own "liturgies"--repetitive phrases in spontaneous prayers, for 
example. Such repetitions, they rightly sense, inscribe certain truths in the heart and thus 
encourage genuine belief and Christian conduct.</P>
<P>	Furthermore, Loconte is far too quick to reject the majoritarian argument.</P>
<P>	Majority in this case does not refer to shifting numerical majorities in various 
states of the Union, but to the permanent majority at the very heart of Western culture, 
which T.S. Eliot rightly observed, cannot remain itself if divorced from Christianity.</P>
<P>	Finally, Loconte is too ready to accept the notion, retailed by non- and anti-
Christians, that Christianity can legitimize itself only by promoting social progress. He 
reminds us that Christians objected to past mistreatment of black Americans and 
ministered to the urban poor. Such service is to be commended, but it ought to be viewed 
primarily as a sign of that obedience that has, as its principal purpose, His praise and 
glory.</P>

<H3>Protestant Consensus</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Amending the Constitution to permit school prayer admittedly is a thornier 
problem for religious conservatives than most of us admit. On balance, I am slowly 
coming around to Loconte's side of the issue. I write, however, to take issue with two of 
his points.</P>
<P>	First, I agree with Loconte's apparent view that state neutrality towards religion 
is, at least in theory, the best course for a representative democracy. In practice, however, 
neutrality has serious flaws.</P>
<P>	Since the Supreme Court got into the school-prayer business back in the 1960s, 
separation of church and state has evolved from neutrality among religions to neutrality 
between religion and secularism. Worse yet, as Loconte recounts, hostility to religion has 
usually been the means by which the latter form of neutrality  has been pursued.</P>
<P>	Loconte apparently believe that one can eradicate hostility towards religion while 
simultaneously retaining the goal of neutrality. I am less sanguine on this score, 
especially if neutrality between religion and secularism remains the goal.</P>
<P>	Ultimately, trying to remain neutral between the claims of religious belief and 
secularism is like trying to serve two masters at the same time. But as Christ taught, 
humans cannot do this: We will love one and despise the other.</P>
<P>	Second, I find it not a little astonishing that a reputable conservative should 
premise so much of his argument on diversity and multiculturalism. As we all know, our 
society faces a growing number of challenges: crime; a growing underclass; rising levels 
of single-parent households; rampant legal and illegal immigration by persons from the 
Third World who do not share the language, religion, or culture of most Americans. It is 
worth remembering, however, that we have been here before.</P>
<P>	As David Frum points out in Dead Right, our country faced similar problems 
during the first two decades of this century. Frum reminds us that our grandparents grew 
up in cities that, like our own, were violent and unruly. A tide of legal and illegal 
immigration was bringing to our shores a horde that did not speak our language, did not 
share our customs, and felt little loyalty to our country. This resulted in an urban 
proletariat that was not only of unprecedented size, but also poor, violent, and apparently 
immune to assimilation. The very definition of what it means to be an American was 
being called into question by a multicultural tidal wave.</P>
<P>	Fortunately, the Progressives of that era were able to institute a set of reforms that 
in fact assimilated virtually all of the new cultures into a single American culture. This 
American culture was enriched by the new immigrants, but not fundamentally changed. It 
was possible only because reformers knew what it meant to be an American. They knew 
America was more than just an idea. They knew that America had a common culture and 
a common heritage. Assimilating new arrivals to that culture could be painful, but it had 
to be done and it was done. A nation that was stronger and richer in both a material and a 
spiritual sense emerged.</P>
<P>	For better or worse, the Protestant Consensus was a key building block of the 
uniquely American culture our parents and grandparents passed down to us. To be sure, 
as Loconte points out, this led some Jews and many Catholics to opt out of certain key 
institutions, especially educational ones. As many scholars have pointed out, however, 
modern American Jews and Catholics have largely assimilated to the Protestant 
Consensus.</P>
<P>	Accordingly, I think it is now fair to be more concerned with the possibility that 
the absence of school prayer will lead evangelicals (and maybe even some Jews and 
Catholics) to opt out of public education than to be concerned that school prayer will 
deter Jews and Catholics from opting in.</P>
<P>	To be sure, as Loconte points out, our country includes a growing array of 
religions (and even more New Age cults)that have not accepted the Protestant Consensus. 
If I am right in believing that the Protestant Consensus has social as well as religious 
significance, and House Speaker Gingrich is right in believing American civilization is in 
grave danger, starting the school day off with a generic Protestant prayer could become 
an important component in restoring the notion of a unified American culture. 
Accordingly, I reject Loconte's conclusion that school prayer is not an appropriate tool of 
civic order. To the contrary, I suspect that restoration of civic order may not be possible 
without some attempt to use the public schools to inculcate the virtues inherent in the 
Protestant Consensus.</P>

<H3>Blurred God</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Joe Loconte's article is both provocative and persuasive. Advocates of officially 
permitted prayer simply neglect today's "profound cultural and religious diversity."</P>
<P>	When I attended public school in York, Pennsylvania, in the 1930s, Americans 
were far more homogenous. Along with the Pledge of Allegiance, we recited verses from 
the Old or New Testament without comment.</P>
<P>	This unchallenged practice did not violate the establishment clause any more than 
etching "In God We Trust" on our coins.</P>
<P>	Ironically, formal prayer in the schools can have the unintended effect of 
trivializing religion. One sassy pupil, exposed to a canned prayer, said he thought of God 
as an "oblong blur."</P>
<P>	Certainly, the schools--public and private--have an obligation to teach about the 
impact of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam on history and culture. And at the very least 
they should acknowledge the fact that the American founders believed in the majesty of 
God and recognized that this nation and every nation stands under divine mercy and 
judgement.</P>
<P>	Parents concerned about secularization and moral decay should direct their energy 
to restoring the vitality of our Judeo-Christian heritage and encouraging loving two-
parent families that honor God and teach their children the difference between right and 
wrong.</P>

<H3>First Freedom Foremost</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Joe Loconte has both misunderstood my views and neglected he fundamental 
rationale for school prayer in his article. He gives only three arguments, what he calls 
"primary arguments," for school prayer.</P>
<P>	First, he says, there is the historical approach: "American society always has been 
religious and public prayers seems an appropriate reflection of the nation's emphasis on 
faith and religious freedom."</P>
<P>	Second, a religious rationale: "Schools and other public institutions have a 
responsibility to acknowledge Deity--."</P>
<P>	Third, school prayer "could help slow the social chaos and spiritual decay that are 
infecting youth culture"--the plea for civil order as he puts it. These may be arguments 
for school prayer, but they are in fact only supporting arguments and not "primary" 
arguments.</P> 
<P>    The fourth, and missing rationale, is the guarantee of religious liberty and 
freedom of religious expression promised in the First Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. This religious liberty rationale is of paramount importance. Loconte 
includes a highly sentimentalized form of this argument in his first suggested rationale for 
school prayer, but I argue that religious liberty is more than an "emphasis" in America, it 
is part of our raison d'&#234 tre. The American experiment, a novus ordo saeclorum, depends 
upon the freely expressed opinions of its people. Free expression includes religious 
expression. Religious expression includes prayer.</P> 
<P>	Loconte is accurate to say that I am among those religious conservatives who 
agree with the Supreme Court's 1962 "ruling banning state-sponsored school prayer--." 
However, I do not  agree, as he implies that "student-led prayers can have a coercive 
effect in the unique environment of public education." As long as these prayers are 
student-initiated, student-sponsored, and student-led, they are no more coercive than 
student-initiated, student-sponsored, and student-led discussions of religious topics at 
recess. Surely Loconte does not believe in a religiously sanitized playground.</P>
<P>	Furthermore, I have said, "I think our society will not survive unless there is a 
broad-based religious commitment, but it is not the responsibility of the government to 
promote it." However, I have also argued that government has the obligation not to 
prohibit the religious commitments or expressions of its citizens. It hardly seems 
promotional for public schools to allow students to pray, as they feel led, without 
disrupting class time. In fact, to prohibit such student prayer, violates First Amendment 
guarantees against such censorship and suppression of religious speech.</P>
<P>	The Christian Life Commission is the religious-liberty agency of the Southern 
Baptist Convention, the nation's largest non-Catholic religious denomination, with over 
15.4 million members in over 38,400 churches. We will oppose state sponsorship of 
school prayer. We will, however, vigorously support religious liberty. The religious 
liberty rationale entails that students of religious faith, or non-religious commitments for 
that matter, should be free to express their religion or non-religion in their classroom. The 
First Amendment's "free exercise" clause demands no less than free exercise.</P>
<P>	Does the religious liberty rationale entail that Christian students may hear the 
prayers of Jewish students, Muslim students, or New Age students? Of course.</P>
<P>	 In a free democracy, we must protect everyone's right to religious expression. 
Neither school officials nor student majorities may pick and choose which religious 
expression to permit or disallow.</P> 
<P>	Prayer goes up, it doesn't come down. That is, students themselves determine the 
content and frequency of prayer, not government or school boards, and an open forum 
means a forum open to all students' religious convictions.</P>
<P>	As Thomas Jefferson once said, "The opinions of men are not the object of civil 
government, not under its jurisdiction."</P>

<H3>Mission Immoral</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	"Reel Politik: Great Conservative Cinema," by Michael Smith (Fall 1994), was 
great, but I thought it missed the mark in a few cases.</P>
<P>	The Mission, I agree, is "a beautiful film." But hardly "on every level." It is both 
philosophically and theologically as liberal as Howard Metzenbaum.</P>
<P>	Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) has penetrated the barrier of dense jungle and 
primitive culture hoping to establish a mission to the savage Guarani Indians. Eventually, 
he converts them and builds a mission in their midst. But to what does he convert them? 
That is the question by which this movie must be judged. For it is upon that gospel that 
this movie is built.</P>
<P>	Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) learns that gospel. He is a mercenary slave 
trader who has killed his own brother in a jealous rage. For six months he has languished 
in a stupor of self-hate and hopelessness. He is beyond redemption--or so he believes. 
But the gospel of Father Gabriel changes his mind. The gospel of the Bible is never 
mentioned to poor Captain Mendoza. The gospel of The Mission is the gospel of "love," 
small "l." Love your fellow man, sacrifice yourself, do good expecting nothing in return. 
And if you aren't sure how to do "good," just keep watching.</P>
<P>	Rodrigo follows Father Gabriel along the tortuous trail to his jungle mission. In 
penance he drags along a large net filled with the armaments of his mercenary days--the 
great burden of past sins. But this is no Pilgrim's Progress. The burden is not lifted. It is 
finally cut away by his own loving submission to his former victims. When he takes the 
Jesuit vow, he is converted not to God but to "love."</P>
<P>	Meanwhile, the jungle commune has been betrayed by cutthroat capitalists, 
cutthroat governments, and the politics of Rome. Father Gabriel determines to defend the 
mission with love (non-violence) alone. Brother Rodrigo chooses instead to fight for 
right. "If might be right, then there's no place for love in the world," Father Gabriel tells 
him. "Maybe so. Maybe so," he then muses. But "if you are right, God will bless you."</P>
<P>	The massacre that follows, however, bespeaks little blessing on Rodrigo's 
decision. He is crushed. Might, to be sure, is depicted as anything but right. It is 
despicable. Therefore, although Father Gabriel is crushed as well, it appears there is a 
place for love in the world. And how is love defined? You must answer the altar call 
actually printed across the closing scene. Take up the continuing struggle in today's Third 
World. Come to a sympathetic alliance with liberation theology, i.e. Marxism. It seems 
no coincidence that radical leftist priest Daniel Berrigan was an influential advisor to the 
producers of this movie, and appears in a cameo role.</P>
<P>	We are left at the end with a smoldering shell of the mission church and the only 
survivors--one canoe filled with Guarani children. They doff their scant clothing 
(vestiges of a culture that betrayed them) and return to the depths of the jungle whence 
they came.</P>
<P>	Their simple faith has been destroyed by the evil fires of imperialism. Their faith 
in God destroyed? No. That isn't faith that can be destroyed by fire. That was not their 
faith. Their faith was a faith of the mission, and the mission is gone. The gospel of The 
Mission leaves them forever lost in their nakedness.</P>
<P>	Thanks for recognizing the importance of philosophical discernment in movie 
viewing. It's a powerful medium.</P>
<P>	May I suggest another go at it sometime? Perhaps you should give attention to 
The Brothers Karamazov, The Outsiders, The Secret of Nimh, Sergeant York, and The 
Trip to Bountiful.</P>

<H3>Take (The Derivative of) 2</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Michael Smith should watch Stand and Deliver again. The hero and his students 
fight with the school administration about having to take a standardized test a second 
time.</P> 
<P>	The students had achieved unusually high scores on the first test, but their 
mistakes were more uniform than was statistically likely. Although, both of these points 
are of considerable mathematical interest, the movie dismisses them as racism.</P>
<P>	The real problem with Stand and Deliver is that it contains no mathematics at all. 
With all of the cinematic resources that might have been used to convey an intuitive grasp 
of calculus to the high school audience, the movie simply perpetuated the taboo against 
any substantial intellectual content in a movie. There was romantic interest, the struggle 
against racism, Latino pride, but no calculus.</P>

<H3>"Life" Support</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I found mildly amusing Michael Smith's attempts to classify the movies he 
reviewed as conservative, but I cannot sit idly by and allow him to expropriate Frank 
Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, one of the greatest American liberal films ever made.</P>
<P>	Capra was a liberal Democrat and a devout Catholic, and his films portray his 
strongly felt political and spiritual values quite clearly. One of Capra's greatest populist 
heroes is George Bailey, the ultimate liberal activist, who repeatedly forgoes the material 
life (and opportunities to seek his fortune) to ensure that the "little guy" gets a chance to 
own his own home.</P> 
<P>	There was not a lot of money in running a small-town savings and loan, but 
Bailey sticks around to prevent the quintessential wealthy, greedy, heartless 
Republican,Old Man Potter, from shafting the poor, working men of Bedford Falls.</P>
<P>	Potter would certainly have been a Reagan Republican and member of the RNC's 
Team 100, screaming for low taxes on the rich, and complete deregulation of everything 
to increase his fortune at the expense of the common man.</P> 
<P>	At the same time, he would insist publicly that it was for the poor's own good, 
and that it would all somehow trickle down. Maybe he would have believed his own self-
serving rhetoric.</P>
<P>	As for Capra's religious message, It's a Wonderful Life, like many of Capra's 
films, is an allegorical retelling of the story of Jesus. Bailey forgoes the material world, 
continually sacrificing his own chances for comfortable living, to fight for the meek and 
the downtrodden. He goes through a symbolic crucifixion on behalf of the people (and 
his own people seem to reject him), and then is symbolically resurrected (Capra always 
preferred Christmas over Easter for his resurrections; see Meet John Doe).</P>
<P>	Notwithstanding conservative attempts to classify Christian values as 
conservative, Capra's religious views and interpretations of Jesus, comported with his 
liberalism. To Capra, Christianity was about humility, generosity, love, and caring for the 
working-class poor who shall inherit the earth.</P>
<P>	This was quite different than the conservative brand of religion used to justify 
capital punishment, anti-civil rights battles, archaic notions about a "woman's place," 
indoctrination by public school prayer, discrimination against gays, hate-mongering 
against immigrants and minorities, low taxes on the wealthy, and undermining of public 
education through private school vouchers.</P>
<P>	So if a conservative wishes to fallaciously label most of America's great movies 
conservative, many of us will have a good chuckle.  But don't mess with Frank Capra, 
Mr. Smith, because you're not the type he would have sent to Washington.</P>

<H3>Out of Focus</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I was much amused by the irony of the inclusion of Kirk Douglas's Spartacus in 
the article on great conservative cinema.</P>
<P>	Your writer is obviously too young to recall the controversy that surrounded the 
making of that film, which was similar in scope to that over The Last Temptation of 
Christ or Oliver Stone's JFK.</P>
<P>	Both the author of the original "Spartacus" historical novel, Howard Fast, and the 
screenwriter who adapted it for film, Dalton Trumbo, had been severely red-baited by the 
ignorant conservatives of their time; Trumbo in fact even lost several years of his life by 
being imprisoned by the 1950s conservatives' version of The Holy Inquisition, the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities for refusing to testify under oath about his 
affiliations with communists. When Kirk Douglas bravely stood by Trumbo by selecting 
him to adapt the script for Spartacus upon his release from prison, right-wing groups 
called the entire project a communist plot.</P>
<P>	Had your magazine been in existence at the time, you would surely have been 
among the small-minded conservatives crying for the film's suppression.</P>
<P>	So choose: was the HUAC truly an out-of-control witch-hunt that destroyed the 
lives and careers of innocent people, as the liberals assert, or was one of your great 
conservative films actually penned by a Communist?</P>

<H3>Problematic Past</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I believe that Barbara von der Heydt in "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness" (Fall 
1994) has identified some of the real problems in Russia today. As she correctly says, 
many of them have their origins in the social and political distortions brought about by 
almost four generations of Soviet rule.</P>
<P>	Among such problems were the necessity for public lying and hypocrisy 
accompanied by deliberate distortions of historical facts (Aleksander Solzhenitsyn called 
it "the culture of the lie") and a deeply flawed definition of civic responsibility, which 
claimed to foster a benevolent "collectivism," but actually undermined any possibility of 
a genuinely collective moral vision.</P>
<P>	Other problems include a crude, dehumanizing version of atheism which 
attempted to head off any deeply considered and sincerely felt religious notions of God. 
The only divinity was supposed to be a group of leaders whose only motivation turned 
out to be a greedy and self-serving attachment to wealth and power. Their government led 
to conditions which could, but will not inevitably, produce a hideous Zhirinovsky-like 
fascism in the near future.</P>
<P>	I think her analysis could use further thinking along the following lines: In spite 
of Soviet intentions, the previous regime did not succeed in producing a genuinely atheist 
society, as opposed to the heavily propagandized Potemkin Village of Soviet-sponsored 
atheism. Such people as Solzhenitsyn, the martyred Aleksander Men, Valery  Borshchov, 
and many others are paradoxical, but natural, products of the Soviet Regime, under which 
they grew up, heroically battling against cruel suppression.</P>
<P>	The Russian people, and other nationalities in the USSR, did not lose God, 
contrary to the assertions both of communist apparatchiki and some Western 
proselytizers. Russian education, to which von der Heydt only briefly alludes, is presently 
taking gigantic steps toward a program which has at least a realistic possibility of opening 
the way toward a better Russian society.</P>
<P>	Alcoholism, at least in certain important Russian social sectors, is not going up, 
but down: You can no longer retain your job if you come to work drunk, and significant 
numbers of people have found meaningful work which pulls them away from heavy 
drinking. There are many kind of new enterprises and institutions attracting the energetic 
enthusiasm of people who have for years and even decades eagerly anticipated this 
opportunity.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt is absolutely right when she says it is our real moral duty to help 
them in ways both sacred and secular. Such help must be given adroitly, with real 
sensitivity to Russian feelings and real knowledge of Russian and Soviet history and 
culture.</P>

<H3>Band AID</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	In contrast to the shallow reporting which characterizes so many of the 
commentaries about events in Russia written by Western journalists and academics, 
Barbara von der Heydt's essay is an insightful analysis. After four years of involvement 
with Russian educators and frequent contact with many of the "moral renewers" 
described in her article, I can affirm von der Heydt's assessment that "without cultural 
regeneration, neither economic nor political reform will take root and bear fruit."</P>
<P>	Not only is there a need for bridges to be built between those committed to 
economic and political reform in Russia and the leaders of moral renewal, but von der 
Heydt's essay also makes clear that there is a need for a major reassessment of U.S. 
foreign aid currently contributes to the problems.</P>
<P>	I still have not forgotten an observation made to me two years ago by a leading 
Agency for International Development official responsible for assistance to the "Newly 
Independent States." He said "AID has no interest in educational reform in Russia--we 
are only interested in short-term political fixes."</P>
<P>	Teaching Russians the techniques of democratic politics and the free market 
without a serious discussion of the moral and ethical foundations upon which these 
systems are grounded makes no sense and is a waste of resources. Thoughtful Russians 
are asking for counsel on the deeper questions of moral and spiritual renewal; many 
Russian intellectual leaders recognize the moral vacuum left by the collapse of Marxism-
Leninism. What are we doing to strengthen them as they attempt to build a "new Russia"?</P>
<P>	In Russian higher education, there is an unprecedented openness to reform. There 
is a strong desire to "humanize" issues. There is also a great interest in character 
development, which will prepare students to be citizens of a new democratic Russia. The 
effort, in partnership with Russians, to establish the Russian-American Christian 
University in Moscow, the first Christian liberal-arts university in Russia's history, is 
only one sign of the new opportunities that now exist. I hope that we are perceptive 
enough to understand this as we follow developments in Russia, aided by insightful 
observers such as von der Heydt.</P>

<H3>Right on Reds</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	As a 40-year student of Soviet communism, I certainly agree with Barbara von der 
Heydt's grim article and her conclusion that "freedom cannot take root without moral 
reform."</P>
<P>	However, I believe that more emphasis should be placed on the chief cause of the 
spiritual wilderness, namely, the 77-year existence of the communist system imposed on 
the Russians as well as other nationalities in the former Soviet Union by party-state 
terrorist control.</P>
<P>	It should be stressed that communism was not a product of the "Russian soul," but 
an international ideology which took over Russia in the 1917 October Revolution. After 
that time the GULAG, chief administration of concentration camps, was the powerful 
terrorist weapon of communist morality, which allowed the nomenklatura to do anything 
necessary to build and spread the communist system in the international arena.</P>
<P>	In the Soviet Union alone, about 60 million people lost their lives in the process 
of building a communist society. Those who have survived have suffered greatly both 
intellectually and morally, and it will take years for them to recover.</P>
<P>	The long existence of the Soviet Union and other communist-controlled states was 
facilitated, it should be admitted, by the ignorance and cynicism of many Western 
democratic governments. Not only did they grant diplomatic recognition to communist-
controlled states which were not nation-states under international law, but they also 
subsidized and thus prolonged their life by economic and trade relations and technology 
transfers. Many experts believe now that without those subsidies the economic collapse 
of the communist-controlled states would have come much earlier.</P>
<P>	The first American president since Herbert Hoover who refused to deal with the 
Soviet Union as a conventional great power--a mirror-image of the United States--was 
Ronald Reagan, who called it the "Evil Empire" and attacked its communist morality.</P>
<P>	His policy of economic and military pressure was obviously a major cause of 
Soviet collapse. It was not containment or detente, but Reagan's "peace through strength" 
policy that facilitated his early intentions to eliminate the communist threat.</P>

<H3>Bully Pulpit?</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	I find the comment by Barbara von der Heydt that the "Russian Orthodox Church 
is in a poor position to meet the Russian people's spiritual hunger," offensive, arrogant, 
and more than a little disingenuous. To begin with, does Von der Heydt see anything in 
the "Christian West" that is better? Does she promote Protestantism and, if so, which one 
of the thousands of denominations does she suggest? Certainly not the large, "main-line" 
churches that have embraced abortion, homosexual advocacy, and hosts of other social 
evils while abandoning virtually all of traditional Christian beliefs.</P>
<P>	And what hope is there in "fundamental" Protestantism? For one thing, they 
would, in total ignorance of the Russian culture and people, try to efface every vestige of 
Orthodoxy just as surely as did the Communists since they interpret it as being either 
papist or pagan. Furthermore, most fundamentalist Protestants have little knowledge and 
less understanding of Christian history prior to the Reformation and tend to see 
everything in light of that historic event. Yet, as each group disagrees with its fellows and 
feels free to go off and start still another "denomination," we see proof that the abiding 
and binding truth of Christianity does not reside within this religious movement, however 
sincere the individual believer.</P>
<P>	And what about Roman Catholicism? The Catholic Church of Western Europe 
and the United States is often no better than main-line Protestantism.</P>
<P>	While it is true that there are troubles in the Church in Russia, Westerners must 
remember that Orthodoxy has provided more Christian martyrs in the last 70 years than 
there had been in the previous two millenia. Bishops, priests, monks, nuns, and lay people 
died in the tens of millions. And still, the Church survived, her people willing to risk 
torture, imprisonment, and death to be a part and make their children part of her.</P>
<P>	Yes, there are still KGB agents in the Russian Orthodox Church, but Western 
churches have also been infiltrated and, in many cases, completely overwhelmed by a 
host of anti-Christian philosophies and personages.</P>
<P>	Politically compromised Orthodox priests and bishops constitute far less of a 
danger than do the Bishop Spongs, Jimmy Swaggarts and Father Foxes in the West. The 
Orthodox Church, steadfast and unchanged since the 4th century, has needed no 
Reformation nor does she changes her doctrines to satisfy the "politically correct." She 
endures despite infiltration and savage persecution, while most of the "churches" in the 
West have capitulated without a shot being fired or a life being lost in defense of the 
Faith.</P>

<H3>Bear With It</H3>
<P>Dear Sir:</P>
<UL><P>	Although we knew that the euphoria many of us experienced when Soviet 
communism collapsed would not last, we could scarcely brace ourselves sufficiently 
against the hammerings of ensuing events. Russia's progress out of the abyss is painfully 
halting, at best. So we find ourselves in a state of emphatic ambivalence, pulled between 
the poles of despair and hope. Our reservations are encapsulated in Barbara von der 
Heydt's "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness." Negative comments outweigh positive ones two 
to one. Yet affirmation prevails by the end, and properly so, I think.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt is of course correct that moral renewal is the sine qua non for the 
political and economic reforms required to make of devastated Russia a normal society.</P>
<P>	Policy wonks above all others need to understand that, in a moral vacuum, 
programmatic proposals are futile. As Michael Novak remarked, "The free society is 
moral, or not at all." But what do we see in Moscow? Old apparatchiki thrive as new 
businessmen. Power-hungry ideologues of extreme Left and extreme Right combine to 
throttle reform efforts. Zhirinovsky and company co-opt the beautiful word "patriot." In 
short, Dostoevsky's The Devils remains as prophetic as ever.</P>
<P>	What Russia most needs now is to come to terms with its atrocity-riddled past in a 
spirit of repentance, both personal and national. For a long-Christian nation, the likeliest 
route to catharsis is religious revival.</P>
<P>	That one is underway we do not know from the Western press. Here, too, von der 
Heydt helps us, with her informative book, Candles Behind the Wall. Into the confusion 
enters Solzhenitsyn, whom von der Heydt shrewdly highlights. Now with his own 
television program, he is the primary messenger of Russian repentance. As in America for 
two decades, so in Russia today, we will underestimate his appeal the populace if we 
listen only to the intellectuals.</P>
<P>	Who knows what rough beast slouches toward a Russian Bethlehem to be born? 
For the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren, this story will be one of great drama 
and world-historical importance.</P>
<P>	Von der Heydt magnificently shows us how to approach our reading of it.</P>

<H3>Barbara von der Heydt responds:</H3>
<UL><P>	Events in Chechnya have illustrated that the crisis in Russia is indeed a moral one 
which has political consequences. The newborn democracy in Russia may be strangled in 
its infancy. Russian reformers fear for the future of the country. For example, Duma 
members Valery Borschov and Gleb Yakunin, who were in Chechnya in January to 
monitor the invasion, have soundly condemned the action, and are perplexed at the 
slowness of the West to do the same.</P>
<P>	They say the door to freedom in Russia that swung open dramatically in 1991 
may be swinging closed already.</P>
<P>	It is necessary to act now to encourage the few lights of moral, spiritual and 
intellectual renewal in Russia which illuminate the darkening landscape. The cells of civil 
society that have sprung up in Russia need to put down roots and grow. Their success, or 
lack of it, may well determine what era will follow Yeltsin.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, the kind of change in Russia which is urgently ended, as confirmed 
by Edward Ericson, cannot be brought about with a "quick fix," the kind sought by AID 
officers John Bernbaum rightly condemned as short-sighted.</P>
<P>	The Russian-American Christian University which Bernbaum is co-founding is 
exactly the kind of long-term investment needed to shape the intellectual and moral 
climate.</P> 
<P>	Irwin Weil correctly pointed out that there are a number of efforts underway in 
Russian education aimed at revitalizing the nation. Aleksander Abramov's project to 
rewrite the textbooks for the Russian school system to include moral teachings has 
produced many manuscripts already, but funding is still needed from the West to print the 
books. The urgency of such a project is evident to anyone who understands the power of 
ideas.</P>
<P>	The conclusions presented in "Russia's Spiritual Wilderness" are those of 
Russians, many of whom I have known for some years.</P>
<P>	The Orthodox cited say there is a need for renewal among their own ranks. The 
remarks of Valerie Protopapas are evidence of the inability of some Orthodox to 
acknowledge the truth of Romans 3:23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of 
God." We are all found wanting: that means Protestants, Catholics, and every stripe of 
believer, including Orthodox. Obviously the Western churches are in a state of need as 
well. Every church is flawed and in need of forgiveness, as is every person, myself 
included.</P>
<P>	In a presentation in Moscow this past December Zoya Krakhmalnikova, a devout 
Russian Orthodox author who was jailed in the 1980s for her writings, described three 
acute ailments of her country: "The hatred that destroyed the soul of Russia," resurgent 
nationalism, and the "illness of the church which is an absolute catastrophe for our 
country." She calls for repentance and renewal. Russian Orthodox priest Father 
Alexander Borisov, in his recently released book The Fields are Ripe, takes the church he 
loves to task. "It's a paradox, but our church had preached not Jesus Christ but more 
itself, its own regulations, legends, icons, rituals, chanting and so on." Father Alexander 
has been attacked publicly by elements of the Orthodox Church as a "heretic" for such 
utterances.</P>
<P>	The main issue is not the church, but the character of Russia. Recent events 
indicate that even democratic-minded reformers may opt for untruth and abuse of force, 
in the absence of a moral code that prohibits them.</P> 
<P>	Until the leadership of Russia is willing to acknowledge a power higher than its 
own, and act accordingly, the country will continue to flounder on the shoals of self-
interest, corruption, and chaos.</P></UL>

<UL><P>	Sadly, Stephen Glass's article "Yes We Kenosha" (Fall 1994) demonstrates the 
kind of facile grand-standing that so often undermines the credibility of conservative 
policy positions. </P>
<P>	Yes, the "Kenosha miracle," such as it is, has brought stability to the economy of 
southeastern Wisconsin. Credit must go to local and state officials who worked to bring 
new businesses into the area; credit must also go to workers who bounced back from 
what was for many a deep personal loss. </P>
<P>	That the complex drama of a community in transition can be reduced by Glass to 
trite sloganeering--e.g. "Doomsayers Silenced," "A Victory for the Market"--should 
give pause to serious students of democracy.</P>
<P>	Glass would have us believe that because Kenosha prospered in the aftermath of 
the plant closing, it provides "a testimony to the resiliency of market capitalism."</P> 
<P>	Yet he tell you nothing of events that led up to the closing, nothing of the new 
assembly plant AMC was preparing to build in Kenosha, nothing of Chrysler's 
commitment to produce cars in Kenosha for three to five years after acquiring AMC (the 
closing came within less than a year), nothing of the betrayal workers felt at the hands of 
their elected representatives.</P>
<P>	Glass praises Governor Tommy Thompson's tax policies, but fails to mention that 
he actively supported a state-sponsored lawsuit against Chrysler, as did local politicians 
during their election campaigns.</P>
<P>	Quoting me out of context, Glass suggests that I "can't comprehend" why people 
welcomed the shutdown, yet neglects to say that a major portion of my book, The End of 
the Line: Lost Jobs, New Lives in Postindustrial America, is devoted to understanding 
this point of view. Kenosha's uneven development--which benefits some, but not 
others--was achieved at the expense of democratic ideals.</P> 
<P>	Do the ends justify any means?</P>

<H3>Stephen Glass responds:</H3>
<UL><P>	I welcome Kathryn Marie Dudley's acknowledgement that the "Kenosha Miracle" 
has brought stability to southeastern Wisconsin's economy. While her 200-page book 
details the pain of autoworkers and their children in the wake of the plant closing, she 
neglects to mention the town's post-Chrysler renaissance.</P>
<P>	Since the plant closed in December 1988, the unemployment rate has averaged 5.7 
percent, less than half the mean of 11.6 percent during the five years preceding the 
shutdown. Average annual wages have increased nearly $2,000 per person and 33 percent 
more employers now operate in the Kenosha area. Moreover, housing sales more than 
doubled, and although homes used to linger on the market for months, they now usually 
sell within 90 days.</P> 
<P>	Kenosha is a tribute to low taxes and deregulation; it demonstrates the beauty of 
American capitalism and the entrepreneurial spirit.</P></UL>

<title>10 Basic Resume Tips  - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">


<CENTER>

<h3>10 BASIC RESUME TIPS</h3></CENTER>

<p>
<b>PURPOSE OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	The purpose of the resume is not to get you a job, but to get you an interview. The 
	resume is the first stage of initial employer/employee contact.</blockquote>

<b>THE LENGTH OF THE RESUME</b><blockquote>
	A resume (particularly in Washington, D.C.) should be one page. If your resume is more than one page, shrink it.  A resume is not a comprehensive, detailed history of your life and career- that is a curriculum vitae typically used in academia, the legal profession and other fields.  A resume should be a summary of your skills and experience.  It should be user friendly- easy and quick to read. .</blockquote>


<b>PAPER COLOR</b><blockquote>
	White or Ivory colored paper is recommended.  It is important to avoid bright neon colors 
	or any colors that appear loud and unprofessional.  It is not the color of the resume that 
	makes a candidate stand out, it is the clarity of his/her resume. .</blockquote>


<b>PROOFREADING</b><blockquote>
	It is important to have three different people proofread your resume for mistakes. The 
	most common mistakes are spelling errors, inconsistency, and gaps in dates.  Ask current 
	or past employers, your colleagues, and your mother or father to critique it for the 
	common errors.	.</blockquote>


<b>RESUME STYLE</b><blockquote>
	In Washington, D.C., it is important to list your resume with experience first.  This is the 
	first item people will look for.  Education and skills should follow.
	 For job seekers right out of school- it is perfectly acceptable to list your education first 
	since experience may be limited. Experience and skills should follow.  
	It is also important to list internships.  This will help recent graduates show some 
	experience and familiarity with the business world.  
	Make sure your resume is written using one or two clear fonts of a reasonable size ( 8 
	point is too small, 16 point is too large). .</blockquote>


<b>SHOW DATES AND LOCATIONS</b><blockquote>
	It is important to list dates and locations for any held jobs, internships, etc. Make sure that 
	dates showing large gaps or overlap are justified. .</blockquote>


<b>AVOID LONG SENTENCES AND LARGE BLOCKS OF TYPE</b><blockquote>
	At first glance, your resume will be scanned and not read.  Make your resume easy to 
	understand, avoid acronyms and lingo. You do not want someone to have to sit and 
	think about what your are trying to convey. .</blockquote>



<b>TAILOR YOUR RESUME</b><blockquote>
	It is fine to tailor your resume so that it emphasizes your skills concerning a particular 
	job. For example, if your are seeking a political job, you should put all relevant political 
	experience (College Republicans or College Democrats, any campaign experience).  If it is 
	a job in the business world, list all retail, sales, administrative, and part-time work 
	experience. .</blockquote>


<b>LOCAL ADDRESS</b><blockquote>
	It is very important to have a local address for D.C.-area employees.  If you do not have 
	one, try to list a friend's or relative's address in the area who can easily reach you or relay 
	a message in a timely fashion.  Typically, employers are looking to fill a position within a 
	month and need to start the interview process immediately.  It is also important to list your 
	e-mail address if you have one. .</blockquote>


<b>WHAT TO LEAVE OFF</b><blockquote>
	   For an entry-level position, do not put an "objective" section on your resume. This will 
	immediately limit your employment opportunities. 	
	  Unless you are right out of school, it is not customary to put your high school on your 
	resume. 
	   Also, there is no need to put "References available upon request" on your resume.  	    
	It is understood that you will furnish references when asked. .</blockquote>

The author gratefully acknowledges the assistance and collaboration of Marc Wheat, a good friend and fellow Illinoisan, without whom this handbook would probably still be an outline. Marcs assistance to young conservative activists seeking public policy employment is given unselfishly to all who ask for it.
<P>
	Much credit goes to The Honorable Morton C. Blackwell, President of the <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">Leadership Institute,</a> whose article, Staffing the Conservative Movement [ Conservative Digest, April 1979], inspired this booklet.  Morton taught me and many others the importance of his rule: Go out of you way to help other conservatives.
<P>
	Thanks also goes to Ed Frankenberg and Dave Mason of <A HREF="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</A>, who are the  forces behind Washington Conservative Placement Network, the publishers of this handbook.
<P>
	Finally, personal gratitude is extended to the people who helped me learn first hand, through my own job searches, the information I have shared in this handbook:  Larry Herbolshelmer, Joe Duggan, Walt Longyear, David Barron, the late Lee Atwater, Helen Sanders, Dennis Kilcoyne, David Miner, Jim Lamb, Dave ONeal, Sandy Butler, Richard Viguerie, and many others.
<P>
	This handbook is affectionately dedicated to every young conservative job seeker who finds something useful here. Re-inventing the wheel can be fun, but I hope this booklet will help you some of the trouble.  Good luck!

<P>
		If youre coming to Washington to look for a job, dont be worried that you dont have high-level contacts at the White House or on Capitol Hill.  If youre a movement conservative who has fought the good fight on campus or in your community, you will find there are many people in Washington who will help you get your first job here.  You just need to ask them to help you.
<P>
	However, there are a number of things you can and should do before you come to town that will help speed things along.
<P>
	First, write and print out your resume at home (about 100 copies should be plenty).  A high-quality resume is important to making the right impression --  more about this in Section IV.
<P>
	Next, phone and write all conservative Job Banks through The Washington Conservative Placement Network (WCPN).  See the Appendix for a complete list.  The can hold you get all the proper forms you will need to complete.  Try to have these finished and mailed back at least two weeks before you come to Washington.
	If you already know of any prospective employers for whom youd like to work, contact them as well. Send them your resume.  In your letter, give them the date when youll be in town, and tell them youll call their office on a specific date to set up an appointment. Then call everyone you contacted, to set up appointments for the first week youll be in Washington.  Confirm all appointments with a written thank you letter on the same day the appointment is made. The more times a perspective employer sees your name cross his desk, the better your prospects will be.  More on this in Section V.
<P>

<P>
	Okay, so we would all like to live in a fashionable townhouse on Capitol Hill.  Put this idea out of your mind right now!  The job-seekers life is not a glamorous one-- you may have to sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor for a month or so.  Many job-seekers are lucky enough to have friends or relatives who already live in the Washington area. If you can stay with someone free of charge, you should do so--for as long as their hospitality will allow.
<P>
	For those who are blazing their own trail, there is another option.  Almost all the colleges in Washington rent rooms in their dormitories, during the summer only.  You should contact each of the universities before you leave home to compare rates and access to Metro and other amenities. (Q friendly hint: you may want to ask about air conditioning--not all of the dorms have it.)

<P>
*Phone numbers listed are for the university switchboards. Ask the university operator to connect you with the student Housing Office.
<P>
You may also want to check the bulletin boards near the cafeterias and carry outs in the House of Representatives and Senate office buildings.  Ask the security guards or stop any staffer for directions.  Hill staffers often advertise sub-lets, even for short periods mostly during the summer, which are very affordable.  Delis and carry-outs in the Capitol Hill neighborhood often have similar listings on their bulletin boards..  And you may want to check the Housings to Share listings in the Washington Post Classified Section.
<P>
	Finally, local churches sometimes have listings for people seeking roommates and sub-lets.  Phone numbers are available through Directory Assistance for area codes 202(Washington D.C.), 703(Virginia),and 301(Maryland).  Many Universities have Washington D.C. phone books in their libraries.

<P>
	You will find that the availability of jobs and the competition you face in getting these jobs varies widely with the season.   While jobs are available in Washington year round, the period of greatest movement in the public policy job market tends to be focused around three main times of year.
<P>
	Summer:  This is perhaps the most difficult time to find a permanent job.  One drawback to job-hunting in the summer is that many entry-level positions go unfilled because summer interns are doing the work at very little cost to the employer.  But, with lots of internships available, you can easily get one and use it as a great platform from which to look for and secure a permanent position when the interns leave.  Internships can also help you expand your network (more on this in section V).  An internship also can help you build your credentials and references for a permanent position(this is especially important for the person who is coming to Washington for the first time with very little experience in a public policy position).
<P>
	January:  This is when most December college graduates and people taking the Spring Semester off from school will be in town looking for jobs and internships.
<P>
	This time of year is usually very slow in Washington because of the holidays.  For that reason, it is most difficult at this time of year to simply show up in town with you resume and find a job.  Thats why its important that you lay the groundwork for you job search before you come to Washington, and have plenty of interviews set up and confirmed in advance.  Remember that this time of year is especially hard for the first time job-seeker just after a national election.  Thats because campaign workers and hill staffers are changing jobs.

	September:  August college graduates and student seeking Fall internships will be your main competition for entry-level jobs at this time of year.  One of the good thing about job-hunting in Washington at this time of year is that its a very busy time, theres much work to be done, and there isnt the usual glut of free interns to fill the entry-level positions.

	It is not the purpose of this handbook to teach you how to prepare a resume.  Hopefully, you have been instructed how to do this by your schools placement office.  If not, many fine books on this topic are available at your library.  However, as your resume relates to your ultimate success in finding a job in Washington, D.C., a few points are worth mentioning.
	Prepare you resume and have it printed in advance to coming to Washington.  Have it typeset and proofread it carefully  -- you must make a professional impression!  Keep it to one page.
	Highlight your grassroots political experience, even if its volunteer work, as this is the best way to demonstrate your conservative movement credentials.  Also highlight positions of responsibility you have held, including supervising other employees,  handling cash, etc., even if these positions are not in the public policy field.
<P>	
	Have a separate list of references, which includes addresses and phone numbers, which you can give to prospective employers if they request it.  Most employers will call your references, so clear this in advance with anyone you list.  Former supervisors are the best references.
<P>	
	Have a writing sample ready to give out at an interview.  Academic papers you wrote for college classes may look impressive, but they are usually not the best writing samples.  Use something you wrote which advocates a conservative position on a public policy issue, like a letter-to-the-editor, an op-ed piece, or an article for your school newspaper or a conservative publication.

	This is the most important, most valuable section of this handbook.
<P>	
	Start by contacting all the conservative job banks.  You can use The Washington Conservative Placement Network to help you do this.  From there all you have to do is follow the bouncing ball and take the steps listed below in order.
	<UL>	
	1) Contact every prospective employer you learn about from the job banks or any other source and ask them for an interview to discuss your job search even if they say no position is available.<P>
	2)  At the conclusion of every interview, ask for the names and phone numbers of one to three other prospective employers you can contact as part of your job search.. Most of the people you meet with will be happy to make this referral.
	</UL>
<P>
	You should make a NETWORK CHART which shows the personal relationship between the contacts you develop.  This will not only chart your progress, but it will remind you to check back with your primary sources from time-to-time to see if theyve heard of any new openings.  In addition, your chart can remind you of which contacts may be helpful in trying to persuade a prospective employer to hire you.
<P>	
	You should also keep a set of note cards, or a Rolodex, which lists each contact you develop.  Make a careful note each time you speak to someone in your network.  This will help you remember what you discussed, referrals which were made, and action you should take in your job search.
	<UL>
	3)  Call all the people to whom you are referred and ask for an interview.  One way to get your foot in the door is to say, I was referred to you by.. -- however, be careful not to imply that they are recommending you for a particular position.  Rather, use the referral to let the person know youre not calling out of the blue, but  that  you were sent to them by a fellow conservative.  A referral is five times more valuable than a cold call.
	<P>
	4)  Prepare for each interview as if it is a job interview, even if your contact has told you no position is available.  Be sure to ask the new prospect for job referrals and continue to thus build your network exponentially.
	<P>
	5)  Send a typed thank you letter to each person who meets with you.  Send it on the day of the interview, and for hot job prospects, include another copy of your resume with your thank you letter.  Its good to include specific thanks for the referrals they gave you by name to again remind them of the contacts they gave you.
	<P>
	6) Attend conservative events where prospective employers and others who may become part of your network are gathered.  The most useful meetings for the conservative job seeker are listed here.  Call the numbers given below for more information.

<P>	
	Budget carefully and be prepared for the fact that Washington, D.C., is a very expensive town to live in. Take a temporary job, if necessary, to earn money until you secure a full-time position.  Ideally, it should be something related to public policy and the conservative movement, but, as Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute likes to say, You cant save the world if you cant pay the rent.  Dont go bankrupt in pursuit of the perfect job.
<P>	
	You can take an unpaid public policy internship during the day to build your network and credentials, but work a part-time job at night, even if its non-political, to earn extra money.  For example, you can open mail and make xerox copies for a conservative Congressman for free by day, and work at a conservative phone bank operation for $6.00 an hour at night.  Many people have done exactly this.
<P>	
	Keep enough money in reserve to return home if things dont work out.  Some people keep a bought and paid for plane, train, or bus ticket in reserve to return home if needed, which can be cashed in if you decide to stay.  But by all means, make provisions to get yourself back home.

	In all likelihood, you will not find a job overnight.  You will almost certainly spend several weeks working the phone, pounding the pavement, and flogging your resume.
<P>	Dont become discouraged, many others have followed this route including the author and (almost) all  his friends.  We havent lost anybody yet.
<P>	
	Nothing can take the place of persistence in a successful job search.

	You can make a difference.  You can have an effect on public policy.  You can advance the conservative philosophy you believe in.  Just keep trying, keep smiling, and keep you chin up!

<H1><CENTER>By Design: A Whitworth professor takes a controversial stand
to show that life was no accident</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></CENTER>
<P><B>The year was 1952.</B> In a laboratory at the University of Chicago,
a young graduate student named Stanley Miller set up an experiment that
would profoundly affect the way scientists thought about the most vexing
and factious of scientific questions: How did life begin on Earth? Using
a flask of boiling water, some tubing and a couple of electrodes, Miller
began exposing a mixture of reduced gases - methane, ammonia and hydrogen
- to an electrical charge. When he popped the top off his flask a week later,
he found something astonishing. In addition to the yellow-brown &quot;tar&quot;
that had formed on the inside of the flask, the reaction had produced some
amino acids - the organic building blocks of protein molecules, which are,
in turn, the building blocks of life.<BR>
<IMG SRC="meyerclass.jpg" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="136" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="left"><HR WIDTH="92%">
<H2><I>In class, Meyer uses the simplest of visual aids to convey the complexity
of a living cell.</I></H2>
<H3><HR WIDTH="92%"></H3>
When Miller published his findings the following year, the mainstream press
heralded his work as a monumental step in explaining how life on a primordial
Earth could have sprung forth from a lifeless sea of chemicals. It was that
same year that James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University in
England ushered in the era of molecular biology when they elucidated the
DNA strand and showed how genetic information was stored and transmitted.
Science, it seemed, was well on its way to answering the colossal questions
posed by life itself.<BR>
<BR>
But 40 years after Miller performed his historic experiment, scientists
are not appreciably closer today to discovering how a lifeless pool of chemicals
could have possibly organized itself into even the most primitive single-celled
organism, said Stephen Meyer, a Whitworth College philosophy professor who
has staked out a very controversial position in the origins debate. In fact,
Meyer said, the materialistic theories of life's origin that Miller's experiment
nourished and the accompanying neo-Darwinian view of evolution exhibit all
the symptoms of a theoretical research paradigm in distress. As Meyer describes
it, making the leap from a few simple amino acids stuck on the side of a
flask to a living, functioning, self-replicating cell is the equivalent
of trying to take a young child's first syllables and rearrange them into
Stephen J. Hawking's A Brief History of Time. And no one has been able to
get past the first steps in the process, Meyer said. <BR>
<BR>
But if nature isn't capable of generating life by its own devices, as Meyer
maintains, how did we get here? According to Meyer, nature had some help.
To the consternation of many scientists throughout academe, Meyer and a
group of up-and-coming young scientists and philosophers across the country
espouse a theory called &quot;intelligent design&quot; to explain the origin
of life. In the process, Meyer has become one of the central players in
the newest twist of an age-old debate. <BR>
<BR>
Simply stated, intelligent design theory argues that life on Earth arose
via the purposeful act of an intelligent agent, which people might choose
to view as a deity. At some point when the planet was young, say 3.5 billion
years ago, there was an intervention by an intelligent agent that somehow
provided what was needed - sequenced information, organic material, energy,
etc. - for life to spring forth on a lifeless planet. Furthermore, and this
is key to the theory, proponents of intelligent design maintain that evidence
of design in even the simplest living organisms is scientifically detectable
by applying new mathematical and informational theories.<BR>
<BR>
In the last two years, Meyer's opinion pieces and columns on the origins
debate have appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Insight
magazine, and many scientific and philosophical journals. Meyer has helped
organize origins symposia, presented papers, contributed to books, and engaged
one of the most divisive issues of the scientific enterprise with dogged
prolificacy. He has spoken at origins conferences from the University of
California-Berkeley to Cambridge University, where he gave a plenary address
at the &quot;Cosmos and Creation&quot; symposium last summer. At 36, his
vita is as thick as those of scholars many years his senior. Currently,
with grant support from the Pascal Center for Advanced Studies in Science
and Religion, Meyer is writing a book about design with Bill Dembski, an
expert in math and complexity theory, and Paul Nelson, who recently received
his Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from the University of Chicago.<BR>
<H3>Skepticism evolves</H3>
A 1980 Whitworth College graduate who majored in physics and geology, Meyer
took a job out of college as a geophysicist with Atlantic Richfield. Meyer
said that throughout his undergraduate years, he had always reconciled his
scientific work and religious convictions by believing that evolution and
theism were not incompatible. &quot;I was quite comfortable accepting the
standard evolutionary story, although I put a bit of atheistic spin on it
- that (evolution) is how God operated.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
While working for ARCO and living in Dallas, Meyer attended a conference
that brought together top philosophers, cosmologists and origin-of-life
biologists to debate the religious implications of contemporary scientific
findings. &quot;I remember being especially fascinated with the origins
debate at this conference. It impressed me to see that scientists who had
always accepted the standard evolutionary story were now defending a theistic
belief, not on the basis that it makes them feel good or provides some form
of subjective contentment, but because the scientific evidence suggests
an activity of mind that is beyond nature. I was really taken with this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although he enjoyed his work in the oil industry, Meyer had always wanted
to go to graduate school. He applied for a Rotary International Scholarship
to Cambridge University but finished runner-up to the former Miss Texas.
A year later, when oil prices took a plunge and his level of job security
followed, he again applied for the Rotary Scholarship, received it, and
was off to Cambridge University. There he studied the philosophy of science,
wrote his dissertation titled &quot;A Methodological Interpretation of Origin-of-Life
Research,&quot; and earned his Ph.D. Meyer returned to Whitworth College
in 1990 as an assistant professor of philosophy and was named the1993-94
recipient of the Dean's Award for Junior Faculty Achievement. This fall
he was promoted to associate professor. In addition to his philosophy courses,
he is a member of the teaching team for CORE 350, an interdisciplinary course
that explores the scientific tradition and its impact on the world. <BR>
<H3>Purposefulness vs. purposelessness </H3>
It was in 1859 that Charles Darwin's Origin of Species rocked the scientific
and theological worlds by declaring that life, in all its diversity, complexity
and splendor, had evolved from the simplest of life forms over billions
of years. Human beings were not the handiwork of a divine creator, but rather,
in the words of the late Har-vard evolutionist G.G. Simpson, &quot;Man was
a result of a purposeless process that did not have him in mind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The biggest question at the root of the origins debate is purposeless
chance versus intelligent design or guidance,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Is
life the result of purposeless or purposeful causes? At the most basic,
most fundamental level , you see incredible evidence for intelligent design.
It's becoming clearer and clearer that the ordinary processes of nature
that we see in operation now do not produce the kinds of structures and
complexity that we see at work in a cell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer argues that by using modern information and probability theory, evidence
of design in the form of non-random information sequencing in living organisms
is detectable. He points out that astrophysicists are already using a similar
technique to search for evidence of intelligence in another realm. The $100-million
Search for Extraterrestrial Life project, or SETI, is essentially a giant
interstellar microphone that monitors the cosmos for non-random messages.
The purpose of the project is to detect evidence of intelligent life in
the universe. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer said the same mathematical approach can be applied to biology to probe
for intelligent design. Within each living cell there is a chemical code
or language that exhibits non-random, aperiodic complexity. To Meyer and
his colleagues, the non-random sequences of these chemical messages strongly
suggest design. Even the simplest single-celled organisms show daunting
complexity and organization, Meyer said. These organisms exhibit a functional
integration of parts, information storage and transfer mechanisms, regulatory
and feedback loops, hierarchical levels of organization. &quot;If we were
to see these kinds of features in any other artifacts, we would immediately
infer that they were designed.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Horse heads in the clouds</H3>
But Meyer's critics, who would constitute the bulk of the scientific community
at research universities around the world, say Meyer has hopped the fence
that separates science from philosophy and theology, and has dressed up
an antique creationist theory as science. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a feeling of deja vu here - we've been through all that and
it's plowed ground,&quot; said Richard Dickerson, professor of biochemistry
and geophysics at UCLA, and former director of the Molecular Biology Institute
there. &quot;Intelligent design is a disguised form of creationism. To say
that a life form arose because of a designer goes beyond science. That's
philosophy. It's religious apologetics, which is not necessarily a bad thing
so long as it's not done in the name of science.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ken Kardong, an associate professor of zoology at Washington State University
who teaches evolutionary biology, agrees that intelligent design is an incarnation
of an idea that has its roots in the early 19th century, and the same flaws
apply. &quot;These kinds of views are fun to discuss and play with, but
I would be very reluctant to see these old arguments recirculated,&quot;
said Kardong, who said he has his own problems with some aspects of neo-Darwinism,
but believes that the theory will evolve to solve more and more riddles
of the origins debate. &quot;When you start calling something in nature
'designed,' it is an inference, not a fact. It steps outside of the context
in which scientists do their work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kardong likens intelligent design theory to looking at a bank of white fluffy
clouds. When you see a cloud that's shaped like a horse head, does that
mean it's been designed; does that mean a purpose can be inferred? No, said
Kardong, not if you want to stay within the realm of science. The problem
with intelligent design is the same because it does not start with a neutral
point of view. &quot;If you look at enough clouds, you're going to see a
horse head.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lee Anne Chaney, associate professor of biology at Whitworth, also offers
a dissenting view of intelligent design theory. &quot;As a Christian, part
of my belief system is that God is ultimately responsible. But as a biologist,
I need to look at the evidence. Scientifically speaking, I don't think intelligent
design is very helpful because it does not provide things that are refutable
- there is no way in the world you can show it's not true,&quot; she said.
&quot;Drawing inferences about the deity does not seem to me to be the function
of science because it's very subjective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yet Meyer disputes the demarcationist argument that intelligent design is
inherently unscientific. &quot;Scientists make design inferences all the
time,&quot; he said. &quot;No geologist, for example, would attribute the
origin of the faces on Mount Rushmore to wind and erosion, nor would an
archaeologist insist that the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone are the
result of purely natural causes. In the case of the Rosetta Stone, we infer
design because we know that only intelligent agents have the capacity to
produce the encoded information that the inscriptions contain. There is
an important and clear difference between a &quot;picture&quot; in a cloud
and an encoded message. And modern probability theory entirely supports
this conclusion.&quot; <BR>
<H3>Secular high priests</H3>
Beyond the weighty issue of how life originated, the origins debate raises
big questions about the nature and philosophy of science. Just what is science,
and when it comes to the issue of origins, what delineates science from
philosophy and theology? Is science only concerned with the material universe
and the laws of nature, the observable, the physical, the empirical, the
falsifiable? Or with the contentious question of life's origins, where direct
observation is not possible, can science make room for something more?<BR>
<BR>
According to Meyer, no case better illustrates the politics of origins than
the plight of San Francisco State University Biology Professor Dean Kenyon.
Although his supporters and critics disagree as to the value of his work
in the discipline, Kenyon co-authored the 1969 textbook, Biochemical Predestination,
which was considered one of the most authoritative explanations of how a
living cell could have organized itself from lifeless chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But by the 1980s, Kenyon had begun to have his doubts about the dominant
scientific paradigm he had worked hard to advance, and he began to share
those doubts, along with information about intelligent design, with his
students. In 1992, following complaints from several students that Kenyon
was teaching creationism, the head of the biology department at SFSU removed
Kenyon from the classroom. The Kenyon case became something of cause celebre
for Meyer and others working on intelligent design. After Meyer did an op-ed
piece about Kenyon's case in The Wall Street Journal, and pressure from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee and the American Association of University
Professors mounted, Kenyon was reinstated. Nevertheless, the biology department
at SFSU has proposed a ban on further discussion of intelligent design theory
because it is &quot;unscientific.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Kenyon case teaches us a lot about who de-fines the rules of the
debate,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Kenyon was silenced not because any of his
data were inaccurate, or because his students didn't like him. He was silenced
because his dean sought to impose a definition of science that made Kenyon
fall out of bounds.&quot; <BR>
In order to justify this kind of thinking, many in the scientific establishment
use self-serving definitions of science to justify excluding intelligent
design, Meyer said. But the &quot;rules of science&quot; that exclude intelligent
design are applied selectively. &quot;Dean Kenyon was accused of violating
the canons of the scientific method because he had inferred an unobservable
entity - an intelligent designer. Yet scientists, including evolutionary
theorists, routinely infer the existence of entities that cannot be seen,
such as fields, forces, quarks and past mutations, to name a few.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that, in any case, attempts to draw a rigid line separating science
from philosophy or religion do not work. &quot;Origins theories invariably
have religious and philosophical implications one way or the other. There's
a lot more going on here than just a debate over data. There is also a power
struggle over who will get to tell the creation story for our culture. For
years, materialistic-minded biologists have functioned as a secular high
priesthood. They have defined what the questions are, what the rules are,
and what answers can be considered. Now, as more scientists are realizing
that nobody really has any idea how nature could have produced the complexity
and information in the first cell, many are challenging the authority of
that elite. Unfortunately, some in the scientific establishment are resorting
to intimidation to stifle dissent.&quot;<BR>
<H3>The insect and the elephant</H3>
In a recent edition of Insight magazine, Meyer debated these issues with
Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education in
Berkeley, Calif. Scott, who also believes that intelligent design is dressed-up
creationism, gave her appraisal of Meyer's place in the origins debate.
Scott likened Meyer to an insect next to the elephant - &quot;a minor annoyance
if it's noticed at all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that ad hominem comments aside, he realizes that as a proponent
of intelligent design theory, he is vastly outnumbered in the scientific
world. But that is starting to change as more scientists begin to look for
an alternative to strictly materialistic theories, he said. &quot;There's
tremendous optimism and enthusiasm - a whole network of people are working
on this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And indeed, intelligent design does appear to be catching on in some circles.
At the Cambridge University conference last summer, several senior scientists,
including biochemist Michael Behe of Lehigh University, cell biologist David
Shotton of Oxford University and polymer scientist Walter Bradley of Texas
A&amp;M University gave sympathetic papers in a seminar that Meyer had organized
on &quot;Detecting Design in Creation.&quot; Recently, Princeton University
plasma physicist Robert Kaita gave intelligent design theory favorable mention,
calling it &quot;eminently reasonable&quot; in a Wall Street Journal piece
on the origins debate.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, Meyer and other scientists and philosophers who are pursuing intelligent
design theory have started their own E-mail bulletin board on the Internet,
where they exchange ideas, critique each other's work, and chart out a new
theoretical research program to test their hypothesis. Today there are more
than 130 scientists and other academicians contributing to the E-mail network.
It's like talk radio for the scientifically disenfranchised.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the history of scientific revolutions, numbers don't mean much,&quot;
said Meyer. &quot;Very few people can cause meaningful changes if they have
the goods and can deliver them. Right now we're in the very early stages
of a new approach to things.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But what is Meyer's place in the origins debate? Is he just an insect next
to the elephant? Definitely not, said Phillip Johnson, the Jefferson E.
Peyser professor of law at the University of California-Berkeley, author
of Darwin on Trial, and initiator of the E-mail bulletin board. Johnson,
who also supports intelligent design theory, said Meyer is on the leading
edge of an effort that is attracting more and more researchers and could
ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in the scientific world. &quot;Right
now the intellectual ground is being plowed for a critical debate whose
time has come. Steve and his colleagues are raising some tremendously important
issues,&quot; Johnson said. <BR>
<H3>Young Earth creationists - NOT!</H3>
As important as it is for Meyer and his colleagues to articulate precisely
what their views are in order to establish some credibility in the mainstream
scientific community, it may be equally important for them to establish
firmly what their views do not represent. That may be the greatest obstacle
they face - not being grouped with the marginal characters of the origins
debate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's interesting - when I first came to Whitworth, some people thought
I must be one of those people from the young Earth creationist camp, which
is simply not true,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;We're not absolutists, we're
not fundamentalists in the sense that we want to commit to a certain story
and we're not young Earth creationists, We're fairly minimalist. What we
want to say is that however life arose, design is certainly detectable from
the things we see.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer does not dismiss all aspects of evolutionary theory; he says it's
clear that over time life has evolved and diversified. &quot;That's microevolution
and no one disputes that,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;The big question involves
macroevolution, the origin of new structure, the origin of new information,
the proper sequencing of that information, the origin of major body parts
and functionally integrated systems. Those are unsolved questions. And yet
we have this great extrapolation from very little data, and it is promulgated,
pushed and advertised to the culture as what science has discovered.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Purposeful tension</H3>
It is no accident that Steve Meyer has taken up shop at Whitworth College.
It is a place where faculty purposefully integrate their Christian faith
into the disciplines they teach. But it is also a place with a solid academic
reputation where faith and the pursuit of knowledge do not stand in the
way of one another, he said. That purposeful tension allows Meyer to vigorously
pursue an alternative approach to the origins issue without fear of reprisal
or of being relegated to the fringe.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whitworth doesn't have the reputation of being a stridently fundamentalist
school and it does have a strong academic reputation,&quot; Meyer said.
&quot;It's a place where I can speak on these issues and not bring immediate
scorn and eye rolling. A lot of my colleagues at secular universities could
not have spoken out on the Kenyon issue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How do his colleagues at Whitworth view Steve Meyer? Several faculty members
said that Meyer is a razor-sharp intellect, a great teacher, a dynamic lecturer
who energizes his students, and a prolific writer and researcher who has
vigorously engaged the most challenging issues of his discipline. Yet his
unabashed advocacy of a controversial theory does not come without some
intellectual discord. Some faculty members also said Meyer can be too polemical
and that he tends to turn the scientific method on its head. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer knows that there will never be a shortage of people to disagree with
him. &quot;Howard Stien (professor emeritus of biology) and I used to go
around and around on this issue,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;People thought
we were great enemies and that we didn't like each other, but we were actually
great friends. Howard was just more willing to wait for the Darwinists to
solve the problem while I was looking for another approach.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lois Kieffaber, professor of physics and one of Meyer's CORE teaching partners,
finds herself a bit torn when asked about intelligent design theory and
its philosophical implications for the scientific world. &quot;I do not
rule out the possibility that a supernatural or design event could leave
a footprint in the materialistic world that could be interpreted and read,&quot;
she said. &quot;However, whenever you try to put forth a theory like this
to explain what's happened in the past, you have no way of proving it false.
It's both exciting and scary to think about the boundaries of science being
pushed back. Can the material world give evidence of the immaterial world?
That would be a dramatic change in the way science works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Hans Bynagle, Whitworth's library director who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy
from Columbia University, said he believes Meyer is fighting an important
philosophical battle on an issue that challenges the governing rules of
science. And Bynagle believes science needs to open up if it seeks to find
elusive truths. &quot;We divide up knowledge into boxes for the sake of
organization and convenience. But we can't assume because we draw those
boxes that when we look at reality, everything is going to fit neatly in
those boxes; nor can we rule out certain things because they don't happen
to fit neatly into those boxes.&quot;<BR>
Whether they agree or disagree with him on the origins issues, students
taking a class from Meyer can be assured of lively, thought-provoking discussions
that force people to think through their assumptions about the world. Perhaps
Forrest Baird, professor of philosophy at Whitworth, puts it best. &quot;Steve
brings diversity to Whitworth and he brings a very important kind of diversity
- diversity of ideas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For Meyer, this debate is just beginning. Discussion of these issues is
taking place on a level that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago, he
said. The pinhole is becoming a crack. &quot;We are trying to create space
in those branches of science that are concerned with ideologically charged
questions,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;We want to show that there is an evidential
basis for intelligent design and that the evidence is there. The next 10
to 15 years are going to be very interesting.&quot;<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>When most of us think of the controversy over evolution</B>
in the public schools, we are likely to think of fundamentalists pulling
teachers from their classrooms and placing them in the dock. Images from
the infamous Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial of 1925 come to mind. Unfortunately,
intolerance of this sort has shown itself in California in the 1990s as
a result of students complaining about a biology instructor. Unlike the
original Scopes case, however, thiscase involves a distinguished biology
professor at a major university -- indeed, an acknowledged expert on evolutionary
theory. Also unlike Scopes, the teacher was forbidden to teach his course
not because he taught evolutionary theory (which he did) but because he
offered a critical assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
The controversy first emerged last fall after Dean Kenyon, a biology professor
at San Francisco State University, was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot;
by John Hafernik, the chairman of his biology department. Mr. Kenyon, who
included three lectures in biological origins in his introductory course,
had for many years made a practice of exposing students to both evolutionary
theory and evidence uncongenial to it. He also discussed the philosophical
controversies raised by the issue and his own view that living systems display
evidence of intelligent design -- a view not incompatible with some forms
of evolutionary thinking. <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Hafernik accused Mr. Kenyon of teaching what he characterized as biblical
creationism and ordered him to stop. <BR>
<BR>
After Mr. Hafernik's decree, Mr. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote
the dean, Jim Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kelley replied by insisting that Mr. Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view,&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation
on a young earth.&quot; Mr. Kenyon replied again (I paraphrase): I do teach
the dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and
that some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. <BR>
<BR>
He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching introductory
biology and reassigned to labs. <BR>
<BR>
There are several disturbing aspects to this story: <BR>
<BR>
First, Mr. Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary theory and the
scientific study of the origin of life. He has a Ph.D. in biophysics from
Stanford and is the co-author of a seminal theoretical work titled &quot;Biochemical
Predestination&quot; (1969). The<BR>
book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific publications
on the origin-of-life problem. But by the late 1970s, Mr. Kenyon began to
question some of his own earlier ideas. Experiments (some performed by Mr.
Kenyon himself) increasingly contradicted the dominant view in his field.
Laboratory work suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves
into complex information-bearing molecules such as DNA -- without, that
is, &quot;guidance&quot; from human experimenters. <BR>
<BR>
To Mr. Kenyon and others, such results raised important questions about
how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was. If undirected
chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information found
in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence have
played a role? By the 1980s, Mr. Kenyon had adopted the second view. <BR>
<BR>
That a man of Mr. Kenyon's stature should now be forced to lobby<BR>
for the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of
origins, is absurdly comic. Mr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in
the world about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research
scientists. Yet he now finds that he may not report the negative results
of research or give students his candid assessment of it. <BR>
<BR>
What is more, the simplistic labeling of Mr. Kenyon's statements as &quot;religion&quot;
and the strictly materialistic view as &quot;scientific&quot; seems entirely
unwarranted, especially given the philosophical overtones of much origins
theory. Biology texts routinely recapitulate Darwinian arguments against
intelligent design. Yet if arguments against intelligent design are philosophically
neutral and strictly scientific, why are Mr. Kenyon's arguments for intelligent
design inherently unscientific and religiously charged? In seeking the best
explanation for evidence, Mr. Kenyon has employed the same method of reasoning
as before he changed his view. His conclusions, not his methods, have changed.
<BR>
<BR>
The problem is that in biological origins theory, dominant players currently
insist on a rigidly materialistic mode of explanation -- even when, as Mr.
Kenyon maintains, explanation of the evidence requires more than the limited
powers of brute matter. Such intellectual strictures reflect the very essence
of political correctness: the suppression of critical discourse by enforced
rules of thought. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, San Francisco State University's Academic Freedom Committee
has come to a similar conclusion, ruling decisively this summer in Mr. Kenyon's
favor. The committee determined that, according to university guidelines,
a clear breach of academic freedom had occurred. <BR>
<BR>
Apparently, however, Mr. Hafernik and Mr. Kelley disagree. Mr. Hafernik
has emphatically rejected the committee's recommendation to reinstate Mr.
Kenyon, citing his own freedom to determine scientifically appropriate curriculum.
In response, the American Association of University Professors informed
the university last month that they expect Mr. Kenyon's mistreatment to
be rectified. Meanwhile, as SFSU considers its response, a worldclass scientist
waits -- yet another casualty of America's peculiar academic fundamentalism.<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B>LIMITS OF NATURAL SELECTION A REASON
TO TEACH ALL THEORIES</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">by Stephen C. Meyer</FONT>

<HR></CENTER>
<H3>The sky is falling.</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or so you might think if you've been reading press accounts
of the controversy in Sultan over how to teach biological origins. Some
say that if Sultan allows students access to information challenging contemporary
Darwinism, all manner of ill will prevail. Not only would such information
confuse students about the facts, it would mislead them about the very nature
of science. Worse, it would let fundamentalist religion into the science
classroom. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Such thinking misses the mark. Contrary to predictions,
greater openness in the biology curriculum is necessary if our students
are to achieve scientific literacy and escape ideological indoctrination.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Current biology instruction presents only half the scientific
picture. For example, none of the standard high school biology texts even
mentions the Cambrian explosion, arguably the most dramatic event in the
history of life. Indeed, fossil studies reveal &quot;a biological big bang&quot;
near the beginning of the Cambrian period 530 million years ago. At that
time, at least fifty separate major groups of organisms or &quot;phyla&quot;
(including all the basic body plans of modern animals) emerged suddenly
without clear precursors. Fossil finds have repeatedly confirmed a pattern
of explosive appearance and prolonged stability in living forms&oacute;not
the gradual step-by-step change predicted by neo-Darwinian theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet students don't learn about these findings. Some science
educators justify the omission on the grounds that it would confuse students.
But scientific literacy requires that students know all significant facts
whether or not they happen to support cherished theories. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Or consider another example. Many biology texts tell
about the famous finches in the Galapagos Islands whose beaks have varied
in shape and length over time. They also recall how moth populations in
England darkened and then lightened in response to varying levels of industrial
pollution. Such episodes are presented as conclusive evidence for evolution.
And indeed they are, depending on how one defines evolution. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet few biology textbooks distinguish the different meanings
associated with &quot;evolution&quot;&oacute; a term that can refer to anything
from trivial change to the creation of life by strictly mindless, material
forces. Nor do they explain that the processes responsible for cyclical
variations in beak length or wing color do not explain where birds, moths
and biologists came from in the first place. As a host of distinguished
biologists (e.g. Kauffman, Raff, Miklos) have explained in recent technical
papers, small-scale &quot;micro-evolutionary&quot; change cannot be extrapolated
to explain large scale &quot;macro-evolutionary&quot; innovation. Micro-evolutionary
changes (such as variation in color or shape) merely utilize or express
existing genetic information; the large-scale macro-evolutionary change
necessary to assemble new organs or body plans requires the creation of
entirely new genetic information. Leading evolutionary biologists know this
distinction poses serious difficulties for neo-Darwinism. Students should
too.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, students should not only know the strengths and
weaknesses of neo-Darwinian theory, they should know about alternative theories,
both materialistic and otherwise. Most importantly, they should know that
many scientists do not accept the Darwinian idea that life arose as the
result of strictly mindless processes&oacute;that many scientists see powerful
evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the case of Dean Kenyon. For nearly twenty years
Professor Kenyon was a leading evolutionary theorist who specialized in
origin-of-life biology. While at Berkeley in 1969 he wrote a book that defined
evolutionary thinking on the origin-of-life for over a decade. Yet during
the late 1970s Kenyon found himself doubting his own theory. As molecular
biologists learned more about the complexity of living things, Kenyon began
to wonder whether undirected chemistry could really produce the intricate
information processing systems found in even &quot;simple&quot; cells. Studies
of the genetic molecule DNA showed that the instructions encoded along its
spine displayed all the hallmarks of intelligent communication or language.
Kenyon and many other scientists have now concluded that the information
in DNA&oacute;like the information in a computer program, an ancient scroll
or in this newspaper&oacute;had an intelligent source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Another advocate of intelligent design, Lehigh University
biochemist Michael Behe, has just written a book entitled <I>Darwin's Black
Box</I> (The Free Press 1996). Behe explains that during Darwin's time the
biochemistry of life was as mysterious to scientists as the wires and chips
inside a computer are to small children. As long as scientists didn't know
how the biochemical machinery worked, they could reasonably believe that
life had gradually self-assembled. Now that we know the inner workings of
living systems, however, we can no longer entertain such superstitions.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In one section, Behe examines the intricate workings
of an acid powered rotary engine. What does this have to do with biology?
Well, curiously this engine does not power a lawnmower or an automobile,
but the propellor-like tails of certain bacteria. Professor Behe shows that
the intricate machinery in this molecular motor requires the coordinated
interaction of some two hundred complex protein parts. Yet the absence of
almost any one of these proteins would result in the complete loss of motor
function. To believe this engine emerged gradually in a Darwinian fashion
strains credulity. Natural selection only selects functionally advantageous
systems. Yet motor function only ensues <I>after</I> the necessary parts
have independently self-assembled&oacute;an astronomically improbable event.
Behe concludes that a designing intelligence must have played a role. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Many parents in Sultan had hoped that their students
could learn about such scientific developments. The controversy began when
two ex-teachers Brent and Cindy Rappun asked the school board to consider
placing copies of Professor Kenyon's supplementary biology text, <I>Pandas
and People, </I>in the school library. <I>Pandas</I> has been endorsed by
Professor Behe and many other scientists including professors from Princeton
and Oxford.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nevertheless, many asserted that the book's defense of
intelligent design did not qualify as science, since the intelligent designer
postulated by scientists cannot be observed or tested. Yet scientists often
infer unobservable entities&oacute;quarks, forces, fields, the big bang&oacute;to
explain observable evidence. Darwinists themselves postulate unobservable
&quot;transitional&quot; organisms and allegedly creative processes that
occur too slowly to be observed. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Further, origins theories, whether Darwinian or otherwise,
are not tested by making predictions and observing the results in controlled
laboratory settings as some seem to assume. Rather, they are tested by comparing
the explanatory power of one theory against another. Historical scientists
evaluate theories rather like detectives who must determine which crime
scenario best explains the available evidence. Contemporary design theorists
favor their theory precisely because they believe it has greater explanatory
power than strict Darwinism. And there's nothing unscientific in that. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Of course, many claimed that allowing students to consider
evidence for intelligent design would constitute religious indoctrination.
Many tried to equate design with fundamentalist religion and the discredited
&quot;creation science&quot; movement. But design theory is not &quot;creation-science.&quot;
It does not reject modern geology. Nor is it derived from religious authority
or biblical teaching. Instead, intelligent design is an inference derived
from biological evidence. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even so, all origins theories have some unavoidable philosophical
(and even religious) implications. The present crop of biology texts make
no attempt to hide the anti-theistic implications of contemporary Darwinism.
Douglas Futuyma's book tells students that Darwinism makes &quot;theological
explanations&quot; of life &quot;superfluous.&quot; Kenneth Miller's book
insists that &quot;evolution works without either plan or purpose.&quot;
By denying any evidence of intelligent design in nature, Darwinist texts
promote the anti-theistic philosophy known as materialism. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The threat of indoctrination does not come from allowing
students to ponder the philosophical questions raised by the origins issue.
Instead, it comes from force-feeding students a single ideological perspective.
The rather modest effort in Sultan to prevent this, is hardly cause for
hysteria.</FONT> <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Can scientists change their minds about controversial
ideas? Can they reject theories if evidence requires? That may depend upon
what theories are at stake. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider a disturbing case in California involving a
distinguished biology professor, Dean Kenyon. A year ago, Kenyon was removed
from his biology classroom at San Francisco State University after a few
students complained to administrators about ideas they heard in lecture.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The problem? Kenyon's approach to teaching evolutionary
theory. Professor Kenyon it seems has grown increasingly skeptical about
the textbook theory of how life first originated on earth&oacute;a theory,
as it turns out, he had earlier done much to advance. SFSU's administrators
have insisted that Kenyon not discuss the reasons for his new views with
introductory biology students. Ironically, they justified their actions
in the name of &quot;science.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Controversy in San Francisco</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The controversy emerged in the fall of 1992 after Kenyon
was ordered not to teach &quot;creationism&quot; by John Hafernik, the chairman
of the biology department. Kenyon, who included three lectures on biological
origins (out of 27 total) in his introductory course, presented both standard
evolutionary interpretations of biological evidence and difficulties with
those interpretations. He also discussed philosophical controversies raised
by the issue and his own view that living systems display evidence of &quot;intelligent
design&quot;&oacute;a view not incompatible with some evolutionary thinking.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Hafernik accused Kenyon of teaching biblical creationism
and ordered him to stop. Kenyon asked for clarification. He wrote the Dean,
James Kelley, asking what exactly he could not discuss. Was he &quot;forbidden
to mention to students that there are important disputes among scientists
about whether or not chemical evolution could have taken place on the ancient
earth?&quot; Was he not permitted to mention &quot;the important philosophical
issues at stake in discussions of origins?&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kelley insisted that Kenyon &quot;teach the dominant
scientific view&quot; not the religious view of &quot;special creation on
a young earth.&quot; Kenyon replied again. (I paraphrase): I do teach the
dominant view. But I also discuss problems with the dominant view and that
some biologists see evidence of intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">He received no reply. Instead, he was yanked from teaching
introductory biology and reassigned to labs. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Recently, following pressure on the administration from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee, its Academic Senate and the American
Association of University Professors, Kenyon was reinstated. His administrators,
however, have continued to threaten to &quot;monitor&quot; his course and
content. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Academic Freedom: Disturbing Implications</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For several reasons, Kenyon's case raises troubling questions
about whether ordinary standards of academic freedom apply to science and
whether scientists must now pass ideological muster to maintain standing
in the church scientific. </FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times">First, Kenyon is an authority on chemical evolutionary
theory and the scientific study of the origin of life. After receiving a
Ph.D. in biophysics at Stanford, he later completed post-doctoral work at
Oxford, NASA and the University of California, Berkeley. In 1969, he co-authored
a seminal theoretical work titled<B> </B><I>Biochemical Predestination</I>.
The book articulated what was arguably the most plausible evolutionary account
of how a living cell might have organized itself from chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot; </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Kenyon's subsequent work resulted in numerous scientific
publications. As evidence rolled in during the late 1970s, however, he began
to question his own earlier ideas. When run under realistic conditions,
so-called &quot;simulation&quot; experiments repeatedly produced irrelevant
sludge or low yields of desired amino acids. Further, molecular biology
had revealed the presence of encoded messages along the spine of large biomolecules
such as DNA. Both experiments and developments in a field known as information
theory suggested that simple chemicals do not arrange themselves into such
complex information-bearing molecules&oacute;without, that is, &quot;guidance&quot;
from human experimenters.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">To Kenyon and others, these results raised important
questions about how &quot;naturalistic&quot; the origin of life really was.
If undirected chemical processes cannot produce the coded strands of information
found in even the simplest cells, could perhaps a directing intelligence
have played a role? By the 1980s, Kenyon was sympathetic to the idea.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">That a man of Kenyon's stature should have to lobby for
the right to teach introductory biology, whatever his current view of origins,
is absurdly comic. Dr. Kenyon knows perhaps as much as anyone in the world
about a problem that has stymied an entire generation of research scientists.
Yet he has been prevented from reporting the negative results of research
and from giving students his candid assessment of it.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Second, as Kenyon has repeatedly explained, his view
hardly qualifies as biblicism, let alone religious advocacy. When Kenyon
discussed &quot;intelligent design,&quot; he did so as an inference from
biological data, not a deduction from religious authority. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet even if Kenyon had been motivated by a prior belief
that &quot;God created the heavens and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1), it
is not clear that academic freedom means college students must be shielded
from such notions. Secular intellectuals now openly discuss the ideologies
and philosophies that motivate their scholarship and teaching, from Feminism
and Freudianism to Deconstruction and Marxism. Why must theistic professors
remain silent? </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Palatino">Ideological Neutrality?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The problem is Kenyon's
opponents assume science has a unique rational standing and ideological
neutrality. Subjective considerations from philosophy and religion do not
influence scientific theories; and scientific theories, in turn, can have
no philosophical or religious implications. Intelligent design, and its
potential implications, violates this alleged neutrality. Thus, despite
Kenyon's credentials and concern with data, Hafernik and Kelley decreed
that he had moved beyond science into &quot;religion.&quot; Therefore, he
needed to be muzzled&oacute;academic freedom notwithstanding.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This line of reasoning seems initially quite plausible,
since many areas of science have little ideological or philosophical import.
Upon closer inspection, however, it reveals a disturbing double standard
within an area of science notorious for its philosophical overtones. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">On any reasonable assessment of the origins controversy,
Kenyon's design theory and the dominant materialistic view are not two different
types of thinking, one religious and the other scientific. They are two
competing answers to the same question: 'What caused life to arise on earth?'
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This competition is tacitly
conceded in biology texts that routinely recapitulate Darwinian-style arguments
<I>against</I> intelligent design. Yet if arguments <I>against</I> intelligent
design are philosophically neutral and strictly scientific, why are Kenyon's
arguments <I>for</I> design inherently unscientific and religiously charged?
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In fact, neither approach to origins can claim philosophical
neutrality. Orthodox evolutionary theories, whether biological or chemical,
make the decidedly metaphysical claim that brute matter organized itself
into more and more complex living structures without assistance from purposeful
intelligence. Neo-Darwinism teaches, as the late Harvard biologist G.G.
Simpson put it, even &quot;man is the result of a <I>purposeless</I> and
natural process that did not have him in mind. He was not planned.&quot;
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolution conceived as a completely purposeless process&oacute;a
&quot;blind watchmaker&quot; as biologist Richard Dawkins calls it&oacute;eliminates
any role for creative intelligence in the origin of living things. It, therefore,
directly contradicts not only &quot;special creationism&quot;, but all theories
inconsistent with an aggressive philosophical materialism. This includes
&quot;God-guided evolution&quot; and even more generic notions such as &quot;intelligent
design.&quot; Whatever the merits of &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; evolution,
one can hardly assert its ideological neutrality. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Methodological Naturalism </FONT></I></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet Kenyon's opponents insist
that his approach to origins, unlike their own, does not qualify as science.
They argue that scientific theories must limit themselves to strictly materialistic
explanations. Science is by definition limited to observable realities.
Its explanations must, therefore, invoke only natural processes or events.
Scientists must obey what philosophers call the principle of &quot;methodological
naturalism.&quot; Explanations involving a designer are necessarily excluded.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">This judgment may, again, seem reasonable for it comports
with popular conceptions of what most scientists, especially experimental
scientists, do. But &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; can not be justified
as a normative principle for all types of science&oacute;without doing violence
to science as a truth-seeking enterprise.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Prohibitions against inferring intelligent design are
particularly problematic in historical sciences such as archeology, forensics,
paleobiology, and origin-of-life studies. In historical sciences, researchers
want to answer different kinds of questions than in other sciences. For
example, scientists investigating the origin of life are motivated by the
question 'what happened to cause life to arise on earth?' This question
specifically asks about the cause of life's origin. Since, conceivably,
a designer could have played a role it is difficult to see why postulations
of intelligent agency must necessarily be excluded&oacute;especially if
biological evidence supports the idea. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It is true that scientists in many other scientific fields
do not generally make design inferences. They refrain, however, not out
of deference to rules dictating what they may theorize, but instead because
they are asking different types of questions: ones unconcerned with causal
origins. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the question 'how does atmospheric pressure
affect crystal growth?' The answer 'crystals were designed by a creative
intelligence' (or, for that matter, 'crystals evolved via natural processes')
entirely misses the point. The question demands an answer expressed as a
relationship between two physical entities: gases and crystals. A scientific
law expressing such a relationship can be described as wholly naturalistic.
Yet naturalism of this sort derives entirely from the particular focus of
scientific interest and the need to answer the question asked. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Answers to historical questions are, of course, also
subject to contextual constraints, but none that justify prohibitions against
considering design. Those who insist otherwise simply make an unwarranted
extrapolation. They mistakenly treat an accurate description of scientific
theorizing in one area as if it were a normative principle for all of science.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">True Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Defenders of methodological naturalism insist, however,
that prohibitions against design inferences are necessary to preserve the
rigor of scientific reasoning. For example, some of Kenyon's critics at
SFSU argue that his theory of intelligent design fails to qualify as scientific
because it refers to an unseen entity. The existence of an unobservable
designer, they say, can not be tested. Therefore, it can't be part of a
scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet many scientific theories postulate unobservable events
and entities. Physicists postulate forces, fields and quarks; biochemists
infer sub-microscopic structures; psychologists discuss their patients'
mental states. If unobservability precluded testability and scientific status,
many scientific theories would not qualify as science. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Evolutionary biologists themselves traffic in &quot;unobservables.&quot;
They invoke processes whose creative effects are often too slow to see and
infer the existence of extinct organisms for which no fossils remain. Like
Kenyon's designer, unobservable ancient forms are <I>inferred</I> because
their existence would explain evidence in the present. Darwinian theory
and design theory alike rely upon indirect inference and testing, not just
direct observation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">By inferring an unobservable entity, Kenyon violated
no canon of scientific method. In seeking the best explanation for evidence,
Kenyon employed the same method of reasoning as before he changed his views.
His conclusions, not his methods, changed.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Truth or Science?</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The Kenyon case illustrates
another reason for challenging &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; in
the historical sciences: naturalism limits the ability of scientists to
seek the truth. Philosophers of science now recognize that theory evaluation
is often inherently comparative. Especially in historical sciences where
theories can not be tested by predicting outcomes or repeating experiments,
scientists must test theories indirectly. They do this by comparing the
explanatory power of competing theories to seek the best explanation. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If this process of testing is subverted by excluding
theoretical options arbitrarily the rationality of science is compromised.
Theories that succeed in gerrymandered competitions can claim to be neither
'the best explanation' nor 'most probably true'. Instead, they can only
be considered 'most probable' or 'best' among artificially limited options.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">As Kenyon's case illustrates, such a situation now exists
in historical biology. Currently, evolutionary theories are protected from
challenge by arbitrary rules excluding non-materialistic theories. Yet the
question that must be asked about origins is not: 'which materialistic theory
can best explain the origin of life?' but 'what actually happened to cause
life to arise on earth?' Insisting upon strictly materialistic explanations&oacute;whatever
the evidence&oacute;may force scientists to reject a true theory for the
sake of an arbitrary convention. Science so encumbered is unworthy of the
name.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Evidence for Design</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Considerable evidence now contradicts the dominant evolutionary
approach. The universally-recognized failure of chemical evolution to explain
life's initial origin, is now matched by neo-Darwinism's failure to account
for subsequent biological form. Fossil studies now reveal a &quot;biological
big bang&quot; in which one hundred disconnected phyla (major groups of
organisms) emerged suddenly without clear precursors 530 million years ago.
Fossil finds repeatedly confirm a pattern of sudden appearance and prolonged
stability (not gradual change) in living forms. Biochemical evidence reinforces
the impression of organisms as systems whose parts&oacute;as with machines&oacute;can
not be altered gradually or dramatically without destroying the functioning
whole. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">For naturalistic theories a growing awareness of biological
complexity has posed enormous, and perhaps insuperable, challenges. Organisms
display any number of distinctive features of intelligently engineered high-tech
systems: information storage and transfer capability, regulatory and feed-back
mechanisms, hierarchical logic and organization, and precisely sequenced
strings of code.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Confronted with evidence suggesting a new approach, the
full-time Darwinist lobby falls back on subjective complaints about the
&quot;imperfect&quot; design of human eyes and Panda's thumbs. They also
invoke their own self-serving rule&oacute;theories must be materialistic&oacute;to
disqualify challengers as &quot;crackpots.&quot;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet personal attacks and arbitrary rules can not suppress
alternative theories forever. With recent developments in probability and
complexity theory, the detection of intelligent design has already entered
science proper. NASA's $100 million search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) has been based upon the ability to detect the statistical and mathematical
signature of intelligently encoded messages. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Less exotic (and more successful) design detection occurs
routinely in both science and industry. Archeology and insurance fraud investigation,
forensic science and cryptography would all be impossible if prohibitions
against design inferences were applied universally. Imagine an archaeologist
forced to treat the Rosetta Stone as a natural erosional effect or a homicide
detective required to conclude that all victims died of natural causes.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Professor Kenyon believes similar absurdities now rule
origins biology. To Kenyon and others, the presence of biochemical messages
and a corresponding molecular grammar in the cell strongly suggests a prior
intelligent design. He may be wrong or right. His argument is based, however,
neither on ignorance nor religious authority, but on a biological expertise
informed by the modern informational sciences. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">It has no doubt served the purposes of philosophical
materialists to portray Kenyon as a religious fundamentalist unwilling revise
dogma in the face of new evidence. In fact, it is their fundamentalism,
not his, that is on trial.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times">Alfred North Whitehead once said that &quot;when
we consider what religion is for mankind and what science is, it is no exaggeration
to say that the future course of history depends upon the decision of this
generation as to the relations between them.&quot; Whitehead spoke early
in this century at a time when most elite intellectuals believed that science
contradicted classical theism with its traditional belief in a divine creation,
the uniqueness of man and the immortality of the human soul. For many intellectuals
a scientifically-informed world view was a materialistic world view in which
the mere mention of entities such as God, free will, mind, soul or purpose
seemed inherently disreputable. Materialism denied evidence of any intelligent
design in nature and any ultimate purpose to human existence. As Whitehead's
contemporary Bertrand Russell put it, &quot;man is the product of causes
which had no prevision of the end they were achieving&quot; and which predestine
him &quot;to extinction in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">It is not hard to see why many intellectuals held
this opinion. Despite the now-well documented influence of Christian thinking
on the rise of modern science from the time of Ockham to Newton, much of
science during the 19th century did take a decidedly materialistic turn.
Scientific origins theories in particular seemed to support the materialistic
vision of an autonomous and self-creating natural world. For example, at
the beginning of the 19th century the French mathematician Laplace offered
an ingenious theory known as the nebular hypothesis to account for the origin
of the solar system as the outcome of purely natural gravitational forces.
In geology, Charles Lyell explained the origin of the earth's most dramatic
topographical features&oacute;mountain ranges and canyons&oacute;as the
result of slow, gradual and completely naturalistic processes of change.
Most significantly, Darwin's evolutionary theory sought to show that the
blind process of natural selection acting on random variations could, and
did, account for the origin of new forms of life without any divine intervention
or guidance. According to Darwin, living organisms only <I>appeared</I>
to be designed by an intelligent creator; nature itself was the real creator.
Even in cosmology, a belief in the infinity of space and time obviated any
need to consider the question of the ultimate origin of matter. Thus, for
scientific materialists at the end of the nineteenth century, the whole
history of the universe and life could be told as a seamless&#130; or nearly
seamless, unfolding of the potentiality of matter and energy. No longer
could it be held that a pre-existent mind shaped matter. Rather, modern
science showed that matter shaped and created the capacities of mind (and
not the reverse). God did not create &quot;the heavens and the earth.&quot;
The heavens and the earth (i.e., matter) created (via evolution) the minds
that created the concept of God. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">By the turn of the twentieth century, this once
shockingly materialistic approach to science had become the norm. Most twentieth
century scientists have assumed no limits to the explanatory power of materialistic
forces. Materialistic modes of thought and assumptions have spread from
physics and biology to psychology, sociology, criminology, economics, educational
theory, and even theology. Thus, Whitehead would in the end attempt to reconcile
science and religion by asserting that even God himself evolves. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet now at the end of the twentieth century after
many wars and genocidal policies pursued in the name of materialistic &quot;science-based&quot;
ideologies, the scientific picture of the world is rapidly changing. From
the microcosm of the cell and the quantum world, to the macrocosm of an
expanding and finely-tuned universe, the materialistic vision of nature
now seems incomplete. Even in biology where Darwin's theory, perhaps more
than any other, inspired the possibility of a fully materialistic world
view, materialism now seems to be failing as scientists have uncovered an
awe-inspiring complexity in even the simplest of living cells. Indeed, nowhere
is the inadequacy of materialistic science more evident than in the contemporary
discussion of how life in its very &quot;simplest&quot; form might have
first originated. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Problem of Life's Origin</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">After Darwin published the <I>Origin of Species</I> in
1859, many scientists began to think about a problem that Darwin had not
addressed, namely, how life had arisen in the first place. While Darwin's
theory purported to explain how life could have grown gradually more complex
starting from &quot;one or a few simple forms,&quot; it did not explain,
nor did it attempt to explain, where life had first originated. Indeed,
by the 1870s with Darwin's theory of the origin of species, Laplace's nebular
hypothesis, and Lyellian geology enjoying widespread support, the origin
of life remained as the only salient milestone in cosmic history lacking
some materialistic explanation. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet, scientists in the 1870s and 1880s assumed
that devising an explanation for the origin of life would be fairly easy.
For one thing, they assumed that life was essentially a rather simple substance
called protoplasm that could be easily constructed by combining and recombining
simple chemicals such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. Thus, the
German evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel would refer to the cell as a
simple &quot;homogeneous globule of plasm.&quot; To Haeckel a living cell
seemed no more complex than a blob of jello. His theory of how life first
came into existence reflected this simplistic view. His method likened cell
&quot;autogony,&quot; as he called it, to the process of inorganic crystallization.
Haeckel's English counterpart, T.H. Huxley, proposed a simple two-step method
of chemical recombination to explain the origin of the first cell. Just
as salt could be produced spontaneously by adding sodium to chloride, so,
thought Haeckel and Huxley, could a living cell be produced by adding several
chemical constituents together and then allowing spontaneous chemical reactions
to produce the simple protoplasmic substance that they assumed to be the
essence of life. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Orthodox Chemical Evolutionary Theory: The
Oparin Scenario</FONT></I></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">During the 1920s and 1930s a more sophisticated version
of this so-called &quot;chemical evolutionary theory&quot; was proposed
by a Russian biochemist named Alexander I. Oparin. Oparin had a much more
accurate understanding of the complexity of cellular metabolism, but neither
he, nor any one else in the 1930s, fully appreciated the complexity of the
molecules such as protein and DNA that make life possible. Oparin, like
his nineteenth century predecessors, suggested that life could have first
evolved as the result of a series of chemical reactions. Unlike his predecessors,
however, he envisioned that this process of chemical evolution would involve
many more chemical transformations and reactions and many hundreds of millions
(or even billions) of years. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's theory envisioned a series of chemical
reactions (See Figure 1) that he thought would enable a complex cell to
assemble itself gradually and naturalistically from simple chemical precursors.
Oparin believed that simple gases such as ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4),
water (H20), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) would have rained down
to the early oceans and combined with metallic compounds extruded from the
core of the earth. With the aid of ultraviolet radiation from the sun, the
ensuing reactions would have produced energy-rich hydrocarbon compounds.
These in turn would have combined and recombined with various other compounds
to make amino acids, sugars, phosphates and other &quot;building blocks&quot;
of the complex molecules (such as proteins) necessary to living cells. These
constituents would eventually arrange themselves into simple cell-like enclosures
that Oparin called coacervates. Oparin then proposed a kind of Darwinian
competition for survival among his coacervates. Those that developed increasingly
complex molecules and metabolic processes would have survived and grown
more complicated. Those that did not would have dissolved. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Thus, cells would have become gradually more and
more complex as they competed for survival over billions of years. Like
Darwin, Oparin employed time, chance and natural selection to account for
the origin of complexity from initial simplicity. Moreover, nowhere in his
scenario did &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;intelligent design&quot; or &quot;a
Creator&quot; play any explanatory role. Indeed, for Oparin&oacute;a committed
Marxist&oacute;such notions were explicitly precluded from scientific consideration.
Matter interacting chemically with other matter, if given enough time and
the right conditions, could produce life. Complex cells could be built from
simple chemical precursors without any guiding personal or intelligent agency.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Miller-Urey Experiment <BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The first experimental support for Oparin's
hypothesis came in December of 1952. While doing graduate work under Harold
Urey at the University of Chicago, Stanley Miller conducted the first experimental
test of the Oparin chemical evolutionary model. Miller circulated a gaseous
mixture of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water vapor (H20) and hydrogen
(H2) through a glass vessel containing an electrical discharge chamber.
Miller sent a high voltage charge of electricity into the chamber via tungsten
filaments in an attempt to simulate the effects of ultraviolet light on
prebiotic atmospheric gases. After two days, Miller found a small (2 percent)
yield of amino acids in the U-shaped water trap he used to collect reaction
products at the bottom of the vessel. While Miller's initial experiment
yielded only three of the twenty amino acids that occur naturally in proteins,
subsequent experiments performed under similar conditions have produced
all but one of the others. Other simulation experiments have produced fatty
acids and the nucleotide bases found in DNA and RNA, but not the sugar molecules
deoxyribose and ribose necessary to build DNA and RNA molecules. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Miller's success in producing biologically relevant
&quot;building blocks&quot; under ostensibly prebiotic conditions was heralded
as a great breakthrough. His experiment seemed to provide experimental support
for Oparin's chemical evolutionary theory by showing that an important step
in Oparin's scenario&oacute;the production of biological building blocks
from simpler atmospheric gases&oacute;was possible on the early earth. Miller's
work inspired many similar simulation experiments and an unprecedented optimism
about the possibility of developing an adequate naturalistic explanation
for the origin of life. Miller's experimental results also received widespread
press coverage in popular publications such as <I>Time</I> magazine and
gave Oparin's model the status of textbook orthodoxy almost overnight. As
one writer put it:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;James Watson and Francis Crick unraveled
the chemical basis of life . . . Stanley Miller discovered how matter and
energy could create the building blocks of life without a preexisting cell.
Unleashed from paralysis and spurred by the Space Age, research on the origin
of life was launched by these . . .momentous achievements into an era of
discovery and achievement.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Indeed, thanks largely to Miller's experimental
work, chemical evolution is now routinely presented in both high school
and college biology textbooks as the accepted scientific explanation for
the origin of life. Yet as we shall see, chemical evolutionary theory is
now known to be riddled with difficulties; and Miller's work is understood
by the origin-of-life research community itself to have little, if any,
relevance to explaining how amino acids&oacute;let alone proteins or livings
cells&oacute;actually could have arisen on the early earth.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Problems with the Oparin/Miller Hypothesis</FONT></I></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Despite its status as textbook orthodoxy, the Oparin
chemical evolutionary theory has in recent years encountered severe, even
fatal, criticisms on many fronts. First, geochemists have failed to find
evidence of the nitrogen-rich &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; required by Oparin's
model. Second, the remains of single-celled organisms in the very oldest
rocks testify that, however life emerged, it did so relatively quickly&oacute;i.e.
fossil evidence suggests that chemical evolution had little time to work
before life emerged on the early earth. Third, new geological and geochemical
evidence suggests that prebiotic atmospheric conditions were hostile, not
friendly, to the production of amino acids and other essential building
blocks of life. Fourth, the revolution in the field of molecular biology
has revealed so great a complexity and specificity of design in even the
&quot;simplest&quot; cells and cellular components as to defy materialistic
explanation. Even scientists known for a staunch commitment to materialistic
philosophy now concede that materialistic science in no way suffices to
explain the origin of life. As Francis Crick has written: &quot;An honest
man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state
that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost
a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been
satisfied to get it going.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To understand the crisis in chemical evolutionary
theory, it will be necessary to explain in more detail the latter two difficulties,
namely, the problem of hostile pre-biotic conditions and the problem posed
by the complexity of the cell and its components.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">When Stanley Miller conducted his experiment simulating
the production of amino acids on the early earth, he presupposed that the
earth's atmosphere was composed of a mixture of what chemists call reducing
gases such as methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen (H2). He also assumed
that the earth's atmosphere contained virtually no free oxygen. Miller derived
his assumptions about these conditions from Oparin's 1936 book. In the years
following Miller's experiment, however, new geochemical evidence made it
clear that the assumptions that Oparin and Miller had made about the early
atmosphere could not be justified. Instead, evidence strongly suggested
that neutral gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor&oacute;not
methane, ammonia and hydrogen&oacute;predominated in the early atmosphere.
Moreover, a number of geochemical studies showed that significant amounts
of free oxygen were also present even before the advent of plant life, probably
as the result of volcanic outgassing and the photodissociation of water
vapor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">This new information about the probable composition
of the early atmosphere has forced a serious re-evaluation of the significance
and relevance of Miller-type simulation experiments. As had been well know
even before Miller's experiment, amino acids will form readily in an appropriate
mixture of reducing gases. In a chemically neutral atmosphere, however,
reactions among atmospheric gases will not take place readily and those
reactions that do take place will produce extremely low yields of biological
building blocks. Further, even a small amount of atmospheric oxygen will
quench the production of biologically significant building blocks and cause
any biomolecules otherwise present to degrade rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">An analogy may help to illustrate. Making amino
acids in a reducing atmosphere is like getting vinegar and baking soda to
react. Because the reaction releases stored chemical energy as heat (i.e.
it is &quot;exothermic&quot;), it occurs easily. Trying to make biological
building blocks in a neutral atmosphere, however, is more like trying to
get oil and water (or any two inert chemicals) to react. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Stanley Miller's experiment, and others like his,
are only relevant to the origin of life if the reducing conditions he assumed
actually existed on the early earth. Since independent geochemical evidence
now strongly suggests that chemically hostile conditions prevailed, Miller's
experiment cannot be said to &quot;simulate&quot; anything. Miller's work
was heralded as a positive test of Oparin's chemical evolutionary scenario
precisely because he had selected parameters for his experiment in accord
with a then-current understanding of early atmospheric conditions. What
made Miller's experiment significant was not the production of amino acids
<I>per se</I>, but the production of amino acids from presumably plausible
prebiotic conditions. As Miller himself stated, &quot;In this apparatus
an attempt was made to duplicate a primitive atmosphere of the earth, and
not to obtain the optimum conditions for the formation of amino acids.&quot;
Now, however, the situation has changed. The only reason to continue assuming
the existence of a chemically reducing prebiotic atmosphere is that chemical
evolutionary theory seems to require it. As <I>Science</I> magazine's Richard
Kerr put it, &quot;No geological or geochemical evidence collected in the
last 30 years favors a strongly reducing primitive atmosphere. . .Only the
success of the laboratory experiments recommends it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While laboratory simulation experiments have failed
to demonstrate the plausibility of chemical evolution, they may have inadvertently
demonstrated the necessity of intelligent agency playing an active role
in the design of living systems. Ironically, even successful simulation
experiments require the intervention of the experimenters to prevent what
are known as &quot;interfering cross reactions&quot; and other chemically
destructive processes. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Assume for the moment that the reducing gases
used by Stanley Miller do actually simulate the conditions on the early
earth. Would his experimental results, then, support chemical evolution?
Not necessarily. Miller-type simulation experiments have invariably produced
non-biological substances in addition to biological building blocks such
as amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Without human intervention, these
other substances will react readily with biologically relevant building
blocks to form a biologically irrelevant compound&oacute;a chemically insoluble
sludge. To prevent this from happening and to move the simulation of chemical
evolution along a biologically promising trajectory, experimenters have
often removed those chemicals that degrade or transform amino acids into
non-biologically relevant compounds. They must also artificially manipulate
the initial conditions in their experiments. Rather than using both short
and long-wavelength ultraviolet light which would be present in any realistic
atmosphere, they use only short-wavelength UV. Why? The presence of the
long-wavelength UV light quickly degrades amino acids. Thus, investigators
have routinely manipulated chemical conditions both before and after performing
&quot;simulation&quot; experiments in order to protect their experiments
from destructive naturally occurring processes. These manipulations constitute
what chemist Michael Polanyi called a &quot;profoundly informative intervention.</FONT>&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">They seem to simulate, if they simulate anything, the
need for an intelligent agent to overcome the randomizing influences of
natural chemical processes&oacute;processes that lead inexorably, under
realistic conditions, to biochemical dead-ends. <BR>

Biological Revolution and the Origin of Information /FONT&gt;</I></B> <FONT FACE="Times">Yet
a more fundamental problem remains for all chemical evolutionary scenarios.
Even if it could be demonstrated that the building blocks of essential molecules
could arise in realistic prebiotic conditions, the problem of assembling
those building blocks into functioning proteins or DNA chains would remain.
This problem of explaining the specific sequencing and thus, the information,
within biopolymers, lies at the heart of the current crisis in materialistic
evolutionary thinking.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In the early 1950s, the molecular biologist Fred
Sanger determined the structure of the protein molecule insulin. Sanger's
work made clear for the first time that each protein found in the cell comprises
a long and definitely arranged sequence of amino acids. The amino acids
in protein molecules are linked together to form a chain, rather like individual
railroad cars comprising a long train. Moreover, the function of all such
proteins (whether as enzymes or as structural components in the cell) depends
upon the specific sequencing of the individual amino acids, just as the
meaning of an English text depends upon the sequential arrangement of the
letters. The various chemical interactions between amino acids in any given
chain will determine the three-dimensional shape or topography that the
amino acid chain adopts. This shape in turn determines what function, if
any, the amino acid chain can perform within the cell. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For
a functioning protein, its three-dimensional shape gives it a &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
fit with other molecules in the cell, enabling it to catalyze specific chemical
reactions or to build specific structures within the cell. The proteins
histone 3 and 4, for example, fold into very well-defined three-dimensional
shapes with a precise distribution of positive charges around their exteriors.
This shape and charge distribution enables them to form part of the spool-like
&quot;nucleosomes&quot; that allow DNA to coil efficiently around itself
and to store information. Indeed, the information storage density of DNA,
thanks in part to nucleosome spooling, is several trillion times that of
our most advance computer chips. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To get a feel for the specificity of the three
dimensional charge distribution on these histone proteins, imagine a large
wooden spool with grooves on the surface. Next picture a helical cord made
of two strands. Then visualize wrapping the cord around the spool so that
it lies exactly into perfectly hollowed out grooves. Finally, imagine the
grooves to be hollowed so that they exactly fit the shape of the coiled
cord&oacute;thicker parts nestling into deeper grooves, thinner parts into
more shallow ones. In other words, the irregularities in the shape of the
cord exactly match irregularities in the hollow grooves. In the case of
histone and DNA, there aren't actually grooves, but there is an uncanny
distribution of positively charged regions on the surface of the histone
proteins that exactly matches the negatively charged regions of the double
stranded DNA that coils around it. Proteins that function as enzymes or
that assist in the processing of information stored on DNA strands often
have an even greater specificity of fit with the molecules to which they
must bind. Almost all proteins function as a result of an extreme &quot;hand-in-glove&quot;
three-dimensional specificity that derives from the precise sequencing of
the amino acid building blocks.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The discovery of the complexity and specificity of protein
molecules has raised serious difficulties for chemical evolutionary theory,
even if an abundant supply of amino acids is granted for the sake of argument.
Amino acids alone do not make proteins, any more than letters alone make
words, sentences or poetry. In both cases, the sequencing of the constituent
parts determines the function (or lack of function) of the whole. In the
case of human languages the sequencing of letters and words is obviously
performed by intelligent human agents. In the cell, the sequencing of amino
acids is directed by the information&oacute;the set of biochemical instructions&oacute;encoded
on the DNA molecule. </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Information Transfer:
From DNA to Protein</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During
the 1950s and 60s, at roughly the same time molecular biologists began to
determine the structure and function of many proteins, scientists were able
to explicate the structure and function of DNA, the molecule of heredity.
After James Watson and Francis Crick elucidated the structure of DNA in
1953, molecular biologists soon discovered how DNA directs the process of
protein synthesis within the cell. They discovered that the specificity
of amino acids in proteins derives from a prior specificity within the DNA
molecule&oacute;from information on the DNA molecule stored as millions
of specifically arranged chemicals called nucleotides or bases along the
spine of DNA's helical strands. (See Figure 2) Chemists represent the four
nucleotides with the letters A, T, G, and C (for adenine, thymine, guanine
and cytosine). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As in the case of protein, the
sequence specificity of the DNA molecule strongly resembles the sequence
specificity of human codes or languages. Indeed, just as the letters in
the alphabet of a written language may convey a particular message depending
on their sequence, so too do the sequences of nucleotides or bases in the
DNA molecule convey precise biochemical messages that direct protein synthesis
within the cell. Whereas the function of the protein molecule derives from
the specific arrangement of twenty different amino acids (a twenty-letter
alphabet), the function of DNA depends upon the arrangement of just four
bases. Thus, it takes a group of three nucleotides (or triplets as they
are called) on the DNA molecule to specify the construction of one amino
acid. This process proceeds as long chains of nucleotide triplets (the genetic
message) are first copied during a process known as DNA replication and
then transported (by the molecular messenger m-RNA) to a complex organelle
called a ribosome. There at the ribosome site, the genetic message is translated
with the aid of an ingenious adaptor molecule called transfer-RNA to produce
a growing amino acid chain. (See Figure 3) Thus, the sequence specificity
in DNA begets sequence specificity in proteins. Or put differently, the
sequence specifity of proteins depends upon a prior specificity&oacute;upon
information&oacute;encoded in DNA.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The explication of this system by molecular biologists
in the 1950s and 1960s, has raised the question of the ultimate origin of
the specificity&oacute;the information&oacute;in both DNA and the proteins
it generates. Many scientists now refer to the information problem as the
&quot;Holy Grail&quot; of origin-of-life biology. As Bernd-Olaf Kuppers
recently stated, &quot;the problem of the origin of life is clearly basically
equivalent to the problem of the origin of biological information.&quot;
As mentioned previously, the information contained or expressed in natural
languages and computer codes is the product of intelligent minds. Minds
routinely create informative arrangements of matter. Yet since the mid-nineteenth
century scientists have sought to explain all phenomena by reference to
exclusively material causes. Since the 1950s, three broad types of naturalistic
explanation have been proposed by scientists to explain the origin of information.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Biological Information: Beyond the Reach of Chance</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">After the revolutionary developments within molecular
biology in the 1950s and early 1960s made clear that Oparin had underestimated
the complexity of life, he revised his initial theory. He sought to account
for the sequence specificity of the large protein, DNA and RNA molecules
(known collectively as biomacromolecules or biopolymers). In each case,
the broad outlines of his theory remained the same, but he invoked the notion
of natural selection acting on random variations <I>within the sequences
of the biopolymers</I> to account for the emergence of their specificity
within these molecules. Others invoked the idea of a chance formation for
these large information-bearing molecules by speaking of them as &quot;frozen
accidents.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">While many outside origin-of-life
biology may still invoke &quot;chance&quot; as a causal explanation for
the origin of biological information, few serious researchers still do.
Since molecular biologists began to appreciate the sequence specificity
of proteins and nucleic acids in the 1950s and 1960s, many calculations
have been made to determine the probability of formulating functional proteins
and nucleic acids at random. Various methods of calculating probabilities
have been offered by Morowitz, Hoyle, Cairns-Smith, Prigogine, Yockey and
more recently, Robert Sauer. For the sake of argument, these calculations
have generally assumed extremely favorable prebiotic conditions (whether
realistic or not) and theoretically maximal reaction rates among the constituent
monomers (i.e. the constituent parts of the proteins, DNA and RNA). Such
calculations have invariably shown that the probability of obtaining functionally
sequenced biomacromolecules at random is, in Prigogine's words, &quot;vanishingly
small . . .even on the scale of . . .billions of years.&quot; As Cairns-Smith
wrote in 1971:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Blind chance...is very limited.
Low-levels of cooperation he [blind chance] can produce exceedingly easily
(the equivalent of letters and small words), but he becomes very quickly
incompetent as the amount of organization increases. Very soon indeed long
waiting periods and massive material resources become irrelevant.&quot;</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times">Consider the probabilistic hurdles that must be overcome
to construct even one short protein molecule of about one hundred amino
acids in length. (A typical protein consists of about 300 amino acids, and
some are very much longer). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">First, all amino acids
must form a chemical bond known as a peptide bond so as to join with other
amino acids in the protein chain. Yet in nature many other types of chemical
bonds are possible between amino acids; in fact, peptide and non-peptide
bonds occur with roughly equal probability. Thus, at any given site along
a growing amino acid chain the probability of having a peptide bond is roughly
1/2. The probability of attaining four peptide bonds is: (1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2
x 1/2)=1/16 or (1/2)4. The probability of building a chain of 100 amino
acids in which all linkages involve peptide linkages is (1/2)100 or roughly
1 chance in 1030. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Second, in nature every amino
acid has a distinct mirror image of itself, one left-handed version or L-form
and one right-handed version or D-form. These mirror-image forms are called
optical isomers. Functioning proteins tolerate only left-handed amino acids,
yet the right-handed and left-handed isomers occurs in nature with roughly
equal frequency. Taking this into consideration compounds the improbability
of attaining a biologically functioning protein. The probability of attaining
at random only L-amino acids in a hypothetical peptide chain 100 amino acids
long is again (1/2)100 or roughly 1 chance in 1030. The probability of building
a 100 amino acid length chain at random in which all bonds are peptide bonds
and all amino acids are L-form would be (1/4)100 or roughly 1 chance in
1060(zero for all practical purposes given the time available on the early
earth). </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Functioning proteins have a third independent
requirement, the most important of all; their amino acids must link up in
a specific sequential arrangement just the letters in a meaningful sentence
must. In some cases, even changing one amino acid at a given site can result
in a loss of protein function. Moreover, because there are twenty biologically
occurring amino acids the probability of getting a specific amino acid at
a given site is small, i.e. 1/20. (Actually the probability is even lower
because there are many non-proteineous amino acids in nature). On the assumption
that all sites in a protein chain require one particular amino acid, the
probability the probability of attaining a particular protein 100 amino
acids long would be (1/20)100or roughly 1 chance in 10130. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">We
know now, however, that some sites along the chain do tolerate several of
the twenty proteineous amino acids, while others do not. The biochemist
Robert Sauer of M.I.T has used a technique known as &quot;cassette mutagenesis&quot;
to determine just how much variance among amino acids can be tolerated at
any given site in several proteins. His results have shown that, even taking
the possibility of variance into account, the probability of achieving a
functional sequence of amino acids in several functioning proteins at random
is still &quot;vanishingly small,&quot; roughly 1 chance in 1065 an astronomically
large number. (There are 1065 atoms in our galaxy). In light of these results,
biochemist Michael Behe has compared the odds of attaining proper sequencing
in a 100 amino acid length protein to the odds of a blindfolded man finding
a single marked grain of sand hidden in the Sahara Desert, not once, but
three times. Moreover, if one also factors in the probability of attaining
proper bonding and optical isomers, the probability of constructing a rather
short functional protein at random becomes so small as to be effectively
zero (1 chance in 10 even given our multi-billion year old universe. All
these calculations, thus simply reinforce the opinion that has prevailed
since the mid-1960s within origin of life biology: chance is not an adequate
explanation for the origin of biological specificity. What Mora said in
1963 still holds:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Statistical considerations,
probability, complexity, etc., followed to their logical implications suggest
that the origin and continuance of life is not controlled by such principles.
An admission of this is the use of a period of practically infinite time
to obtain the derived result. Using such logic, however, we can prove anything.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Pre-Biotic Natural Selection: A Contradiction
in Terms<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">At nearly the same time that many researchers
became disenchanted with &quot;chance&quot; explanations, theories of pre-biotic
natural selection also fell out of favor. Such theories allegedly overcome
the difficulties attendant pure chance theories by providing a mechanism
by which complexity-increasing events in the cell would be preserved and
selected. Yet these theories share many of the difficulties that afflict
purely chance-based theories. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Oparin's revised
theory, for example, claimed that a kind of natural selection acted upon
random polymers as they formed and changed within his coacervate protocells.
As more complex molecules accumulated, they presumably survived and reproduced
more prolifically. Nevertheless, to many, Oparin's discussion of differential
reproduction seemed to presuppose a pre-existing mechanism of self-replication.
Self-replication in all extant cells depends upon functional (and, therefore,
to a high degree sequence-specific) proteins and nucleic acids. Yet the
origin of these molecules is precisely what Oparin needed to explain. Thus,
many rejected the postulation of prebiotic natural selection as question
begging. Functioning nucleic acids and proteins (or molecules approaching
their complexity) seemed necessary to self-replication, which in turn seemed
necessary to natural selection. Yet Oparin invoked natural selection to
explain the origin of proteins and nucleic acids. As the evolutionary biologist
Dobzhansky would proclaim, &quot;prebiological natural selection is a contradiction
in terms.&quot; Or as Pattee put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;. .
. there is no evidence that hereditary evolution occurs except in cells
which already have the complete complement of hierarchical constraints,
the DNA, the replicating and translating enzymes, and all the control systems
and structures necessary to reproduce themselves.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
any case, as just discussed, functional sequences of amino acids&oacute;i.e.
proteins&oacute;cannot be counted on to arise via random events, even if
some means of selecting them exists after they have been produced. Natural
selection can only select what chance has first produced and chance, at
least in a prebiotic setting, seems an implausible agent for producing the
information present in even a single functioning protein or DNA molecule.
Oparin attempted to circumvent this problem by claiming that the first polymers
need not have been terribly specific. But this claim raises doubts about
whether self-replication (and thus, natural selection) could have proceeded
at all. The mathematician Von Neumann, for example, showed that any system
capable of self-replication would need to contain sub-systems that were
functionally equivalent to the information storage, replicating and processing
systems found in extant cells. His calculations and similar ones by Wigner,
Landsberg, and Morowitz, showed that random fluctuations of molecules in
all probability would not produce the minimal complexity needed for even
a primitive replication system. Indeed, the improbability of developing
a replication system vastly exceeds the improbability of developing the
protein or DNA components of such system. As P.T. Mora put it:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;To
invoke statistical concepts, probability and complexity to account for the
origin and the continuance of life is not felicitous or sufficient. As the
complexity of a molecular aggregate increases, and indeed very complex arrangements
and interrelationships of molecules are necessary for the simplest living
unit, the probability of its existence under the disruptive and random influence
of physico-chemical forces decreases; the probability that it will continue
to function in a certain way, for example, to absorb and to repair, will
be even lower; and <I>the probability that it will reproduce</I>, [is] still
lower. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For this reason most scientists now dismiss
appeals to pre-biotic natural selection as essentially indistinguishable
from appeals to chance. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times"><B><I>Self-Organizational
Scenarios</I></B></FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Because of these difficulties, many origin-of-life theorists
after the mid-1960s attempted to address the problem of the origin of biological
information in a completely new way. Rather than invoking pre-biotic natural
selection or &quot;frozen accidents,&quot; many theorists suggested that
the laws of nature and chemical attraction may themselves be responsible
for the information in DNA and proteins. Some have suggested that simple
chemicals might possess &quot;self-ordering properties&quot; capable of
organizing the constituent parts of proteins, DNA and RNA into the specific
arrangements they now possess. Steinman and Cole, for example, suggested
that differential bonding affinities or forces of chemical attraction between
certain amino acids might account for the origin of the sequence specificity
of proteins. Just as electrostatic forces draw sodium ion (Na+) and chloride
ions (Cl-) together into a highly-ordered patterns within a crystal of salt
(NaCl), so too might amino acids with special affinities for each other
arrange themselves to form proteins. This idea was developed in a book called
<I>Biochemical Predestination</I> by Kenyon and Steinman in 1969. They argued
that the origin of life might have been &quot;biochemically predestined&quot;
by the properties of attraction that exist between constituent chemical
parts, particularly between amino acids in proteins. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
1977, another self-organizational theory was proposed by Prigogine and Nicolis
based on a thermodynamic characterization of living organisms. In their
book <I>Self Organization in Nonequilibrium Systems</I>, Prigogine and Nicolis
classified living organisms as open, nonequilibrium systems capable of &quot;dissipating&quot;
large quantities of energy and matter into the environment. They observed
that open systems driven far from equilibrium often display self-ordering
tendencies. For example, gravitational energy will produce highly ordered
vortices in a draining bathtub; thermal energy flowing through a heat sink
will generate distinctive convection currents or &quot;spiral wave activity.&quot;
Prigogine and Nicolis then argued that the organized structures observed
in living systems might have similarly &quot;self-originated&quot; with
the aid of an energy source. In essence, they conceded the improbability
of simple building blocks arranging themselves into highly ordered structures
under normal equilibrium conditions. But they suggested that, under non-equilibrium
conditions, where an external source of energy is supplied, biochemical
building blocks might arrange themselves into highly ordered patterns.</FONT>
<B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Order v. Information </FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">For
many current origin-of-life scientists self-organizational models now seem
to offer the most promising approach to explaining the origin of biological
information. Nevertheless, critics have called into question both the plausibility
and the relevance of self-organizational models. Ironically, perhaps the
most prominent early advocate of self-organization, Professor Dean Kenyon,
has now explicitly repudiated such theories as both incompatible with empirical
findings and theoretically incoherent.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">First,
empirical studies have shown that some differential affinities do exist
between various amino acids (i.e., particular amino acids do form linkages
more readily with some amino acids than others). Neverthless, these differences
do not correlate to actual sequencing in large classes of known proteins.
In short, differing chemical affinities do not explain the multiplicity
of amino acid sequences that exist in naturally occurring proteins or the
sequential ordering of any single protein. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
the case of DNA this point can be made more dramatically. Figure 4 shows
the structure of DNA depends upon several chemical bonds. There are bonds,
for example, between the sugar and the phosphate molecules that form the
two twisting backbones of the DNA molecule. There are bonds fixing individual
nucleotide bases to the sugar-phosphate backbones on each side of the molecule.
There are also hydrogen bonds stretching horizontally across the molecule
between nucleotide bases making so-called complementary pairs. These bonds,
which hold two complementary copies of the DNA message text together, make
replication of the genetic instructions possible. Most importantly, however,
notice that there are <I>no</I> chemical bonds between the nucleotide bases
that run along the spine of the helix. Yet it is precisely along this axis
of the molecule that the genetic instructions in DNA are encoded. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">In
other words, the chemical constituents that are responsible for the message
text in DNA do not interact chemically in any significant way. Just as the
letters in a Scrabble game can be combined and recombined in any way to
form various sequences, so too can each of the four nucleotide bases attach
to any site on the DNA backbone with equal facility, making all sequences
equally probable (or improbable). Thus, &quot;self-organizing&quot; bonding
affinities can not explain the sequential ordering of the nucleotide bases
along the spine of the DNA because <I>there are no chemical bonds</I> between
the nucleotides that make the message text. Because the same holds for RNA
molecules, researchers who speculate that life began in an &quot;RNA world,&quot;
have also failed to solve the sequencing problem&oacute;i.e., the problem
of explaining how information present in all functioning RNA molecules could
have arisen in the first place. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">For those who
want to explain the origin of life as the result of self-organizing properties
intrinsic to the material constituents of living systems, these rather elementary
facts of molecular biology have devastating implications. The most logical
place to look for self-organizing properties to explain the origin of genetic
information is in the constituent parts of the molecules carrying that information.
But biochemistry and molecular biology make clear that forces of attraction
between the constituents in DNA, RNA and proteins do not explain the sequence
specificity of these large information-bearing biomolecules.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">Significantly,
information theorists insist that there is a good reason for this. If chemical
affinities between the constituents in the DNA message text determined the
arrangement of the text, such affinities would dramatically diminish the
capacity of DNA to carry information. To illustrate, imagine receiving the
following incomplete message over the wire. The &quot;q-ick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog.&quot; Obviously someone who knew the conventions of English
could determine which letter had been rubbed out in the transmission? Because
&quot;q&quot; and &quot;u&quot; always go together by grammatical necessity,
the presence of one indicates the probable presence of the other in the
initial transmission of the message. The &quot;u&quot; in all English communications
is an example of what information theorists call &quot;redundancy.&quot;
Given the grammatical rule &quot;'&quot;u' must always follow 'q'&quot;,
the addition of the &quot;u&quot; adds no new information, when &quot;q&quot;
is already present. It is &quot;redundant&quot; or unnecessary to determining
the sense of the message (though not to making it grammatically correct).
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Now consider what would happen if the individual
nucleotide &quot;letters&quot; (A, T,G, C) in a DNA molecule <I>did</I>
interact by <I>chemical</I> necessity with each other. Every time adenine
(A) occurred in a growing genetic sequence, it would likely drag thymine
(T) along with it. Every time cytosine (C) found a slot, guanine would follow.
As a result, the DNA message text would be peppered with repeating sequences
of A's followed by T's and C's followed by G's. Rather than having a genetic
molecule capable of unlimited novelty with all the unpredictable and aperiodic
sequences that characterize informative texts, we would have a highly repetitive
text awash in redundant sequences&oacute;much as happens in crystals. Indeed,
in a crystal the forces of mutual chemical attraction do completely explain
the sequential ordering of the constituent parts and consequently crystals
cannot convey novel information. Sequencing in crystals is highly ordered
or repetitive, but not informative. Once one has seen &quot;Na&quot; followed
by &quot;Cl&quot; in a crystal of salt, for example, one has seen the extent
of the sequencing possible. In DNA, however, where any nucleotide can follow
any other, innumerable novel sequences are possible, and a countless variety
of amino acid sequences can be built. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The forces
of chemical necessity, like grammatical necessity in our &quot;q-and-u&quot;
example above, produce redundancy or monotonous order, but reduce the capacity
to convey information and create novelty. As chemist Michael Polanyi has
said:</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Suppose that the actual structure
of a DNA molecule were due to the fact that the bindings of its bases were
much stronger than the bindings would be for any other distribution of bases,
then such a DNA molecule would have no information content. Its code-like
character would be effaced by an overwhelming redundancy. . . .Whatever
may be the origin of a DNA configuration, it can function as a code only
if its order is not due to the forces of potential energy. It <I>must be</I>
as physically indeterminate as the sequence of words is on a printed page.&quot;
(emphasis added)</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">So, if chemists had found that
bonding affinities between the nucleotides in DNA produced nucleotide sequencing,
they would have also found that they had been mistaken about DNA's information-bearing
properties. To put the point quantitatively, to the extent that forces of
attraction between constituents in a sequence determine the arrangement
of the sequence, to that extent, will the information carrying capacity
of the system be diminished. Bonding affinities, to the extent they exist,
mitigate against the maximization of information. They can not, therefore,
be used to explain the origin of information. Affinities create mantras,
not messages. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The tendency to conflate the qualitative
distinction between &quot;order&quot; and &quot;information&quot; has characterized
self-organizational research efforts and calls into question the relevance
of such work to the origin of life. As Yockey has argued, the accumulation
of structural or chemical order does not explain the origin of biological
complexity (i.e., genetic information). He concedes that energy flowing
through a system may produce highly ordered patterns. Strong winds form
swirling tornados and the &quot;eyes&quot; of hurricanes; Prigogine's thermal
baths do develop interesting &quot;convection currents&quot;; and chemical
elements do coalesce to form crystals. Self-organizational theorists explain
well what doesn't need explaining. What needs explaining is not the origin
of order (in the sense of symmetry or repetition), but the origin of information&oacute;the
highly improbable, aperiodic, and yet specified sequences that make biological
function possible. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To illustrate the distinction
between order and information compare the sequence &quot;ABABABABABABAB&quot;
to the sequence &quot;Help! Our neighbor's house is on fire!&quot; The first
sequence is repetitive and ordered, but not complex or informative. The
second sequence is not ordered, in the sense of being repetitious, but it
is complex and also informative. The second sequence is complex because
its characters do not follow a rigidly repeating or predictable pattern&oacute;i.e,
it is aperiodic. It is also informative because, unlike a <I>merely</I>
complex sequence such as &quot;rfsxdcnct&lt;e%dwqj&quot;, the particular
arrangement of characters is highly exact or &quot;specified&quot; so as
to perform a (communication) function. Systems that are characterized by
both specificity and complexity (what information theorists call &quot;specified
complexity&quot;) have &quot;information content.&quot; Since such systems
have the qualitative feature of complexity (aperiodicity), they are qualitatively
distinguishable from systems characterized by simple periodic order. Thus,
attempts to explain the origin of order have no relevance to discussions
of the origin of specified complexity or information content. Significantly,
the nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of DNA have, by all accounts,
a high information content&oacute;that is, they are both highly specified
and complex, just like meaningful English sentences. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conflating
order and information (or specified complexity) has led many to attribute
properties to brute matter that it does not possess. While energy in a system
<I>can</I> create patterns of symmetric order such as whirling vortices,
there is no evidence that energy alone can encode functionally specified
sequences&oacute;whether biochemical or otherwise.</FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">As Yockey warns: </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;Attempts
to relate the idea of order . . . with biological organization or specificity
must be regarded as a play on words which cannot stand careful scrutiny.
Informational macromolecules can code genetic messages and therefore can
carry information because the sequence of bases or residues is affected
very little, if at all, by [self-organizing] physico-chemical factors.&quot;
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">The Return of the Intelligent Design Hypothesis<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times">The preceding
discussion suggests that the properties of the material constituents of
DNA&oacute;like those of any information-bearing medium&oacute;are not responsible
for the information conveyed by the molecule. Indeed, in all informational
systems, the information content or message is neither deducible from the
properties of the material medium nor attributable to them. The properties
of matter do not explain the origin of the information. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">To amplify this point consider, first, that many
different materials can express the same message. The headline of this morning's
<I>New York Times</I> was written with ink on paper. Nevertheless, many
other materials could have been used to convey the same message. The information
in the headline could have been written with chalk on a board, with neon-filled
tubes in a series of signs, or by a sky-writer over New York harbor. Clearly,
the peculiar chemical properties of ink are not necessary to convey the
message. Neither are the physical properties (i.e., the geometric shapes)
of the letters necessary to transmit the information. The same message could
have been expressed in Hebrew or Greek using entirely different alphabetic
characters. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Conversely, the same material medium
(and alphabetic characters) can express many different messages&oacute;i.e.
the medium is not sufficient to determine the message. This November the
<I>Times</I> will use ink and English characters to tell the reading public
that either a Democrat, a Republican or a third-party candidate has won
the Presidential election. Yet the properties of the ink and the 26 letters
available to the type-setter will not determine which headline will be broadcast
by the <I>Times.</I> Instead, the ink and English characters will permit
the transmission of whatever headline the election requires, as well as
a vast ensemble of other possible arrangements of text, some meaningful,
and many more not. Neither the chemistry of the ink nor the shapes of the
letters determine the meaning of the text. In short, the message transcends
the properties of the medium. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The information in DNA also transcends the properties
of its material medium. Because chemical bonds do not determine the arrangement
of nucleotide bases, the nucleotides can assume a vast array of possible
sequences and thereby express many different messages. (Conversely, various
materials can express the same messages, as happens in variant versions
of the genetic code or when laboratory chemists use English instructions
to direct the synthesis of naturally occurring proteins). Thus, again, the
properties of the constituents do not determine the function&oacute;the
information transmitted&oacute;by the whole. As Michael Polanyi has said:
&quot;As the arrangement of a printed page is extraneous to the chemistry
of the printed page, so is the base sequence in a DNA molecule extraneous
to the chemical forces at work in the DNA molecule.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">If the properties of matter (i.e., the medium)
do not suffice to explain the origin of information, what does? Blind chance
is, of course, a possibility but <I>not</I>, as we have seen in the case
of DNA and proteins, where the amount of information (or the improbability
of arrangement) gets too immense. The random selection and sequencing of
Scrabble pieces out of a grab bag might occasionally produce a few meaningful
words such as &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;ran.&quot; Nevertheless, undirected
selection will inevitably fail as the numbers of letters required to make
a text increases. Fairly soon, chance becomes clearly inadequate as origin-of-life
biologists have almost universally acknowledged. /FONT&gt;<FONT FACE="Times">Some
have suggested that the discovery of some new scientific laws might explain
the origin of biological information. But this suggestion betrays confusion
on two counts. First, scientific laws don't generally explain or cause natural
phenomena, they describe them. For example, Newton's law of gravitation
described, but did not explain, the attraction between planetary bodies.
Second, scientific laws describe (almost by definition) highly regular phenomena&oacute;i.e.,
order. Thus, to say that any scientific law can describe, or generate, an
informational sequence, is essentially a contradiction in terms. The patterns
that laws describe are necessarily highly ordered, not complex. Thus, like
crystals, all law-like patterns have an extremely limited capacity to convey
information. One might, perhaps, find a complex set of material conditions
capable of generating high information content on a regular basis, but everything
we know suggests that the complexity and information content of such conditions
would have to equal or exceed that of any system produced, thus again begging
the question about the ultimate origin of information.</FONT> <FONT FACE="Times">For
example, the chemist J. C. Walton has argued (echoing earlier articles by
Mora) that even the self-organization produced in Prigogine-style convection
currents does not exceed the organization or information represented by
the the experimental apparatus used to create the currents. Similarly, Maynard-Smith
and Dyson have shown that Manfred Eigen's so-called hypercycle model for
generating information naturalistically is subject to the same law of information
loss. They show, first, that Eigen's hypercycles presuppose a large initial
contribution of information in the form of a long RNA molecule and some
forty specific proteins. More significantly, they show that because hypercycles
lack an error-free mechanism of self-replication, they become susceptible
to various &quot;error-catastrophes&quot; that ultimately diminish, not
increase, the information content of the system over time. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Instead,
our experience with information-intensive systems (especially codes and
languages) indicates that such systems always come from an intelligent source&oacute;i.e.,
from mental or personal agents. This generalization holds not only for the
information present in languages and codes but also for the non-grammatical
information (also describable as specified complexity) inherent in machines
or expressed in works of art. Like the text of a newspaper, the parts of
a supercomputer and the faces on Mount Rushmore require many instructions
to specify their shape or arrangement and consequently, have a high information
content. Each of these systems are also, not coincidentally, the result
of intelligent design, not chance or material forces. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Our generalization about the cause of information
has, ironically, received confirmation from origin-of-life research itself.
During the last forty years, every naturalistic model proposed has failed
to explain the origin of information. Thus, mind or intelligence or what
philosophers call &quot;agent causation,&quot; now stands as the only known
cause known to be capable of creating an information-rich system, including
the coding regions of DNA, functional proteins and the cell as a whole.
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Because mind or intelligent design is a necessary
cause of an informative system, one can detect (or, logically, retrodict)
the past action of an intelligent cause from the presence of an information-intensive
effect, even if the cause itself cannot be directly observed. Since information
requires an intelligent source, the flowers spelling &quot;Welcome to Victoria&quot;
in the gardens of Victoria harbor, lead visitors to infer the activity of
intelligent agents even if they did not see the flowers planted and arranged.
Similarly, the specifically arranged nucleotide sequences&oacute;the encoded
information&oacute;in DNA imply the past action of an intelligent mind,
even if such mental agency cannot be directly observed.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Moreover, the logical calculus underlying such
inferences follows a valid and well-established method used in all historical
and forensic sciences. In historical sciences, knowledge of the present
causal powers of various entities and processes enables scientists to make
inferences about possible causes in the past. When a thorough study of various
possible causes turns up just a single adequate cause for a given effect,
historical or forensic scientists can make fairly definitive inferences
about the past. Several years ago, for example, one of the forensic pathologists
from the original Warren Commission that investigated the assassination
of President Kennedy spoke out to quash rumors about a second gunman firing
from in front of the motorcade. Apparently, the bullet hole in the back
of President Kennedy's skull evidenced a distinctive beveling pattern that
clearly indicated its direction of entry. In this case, it revealed definitely
that the bullet had entered from the rear. The pathologist called the beveling
pattern a &quot;distinctive diagnostic&quot; to indicate a necessary causal
relationship between the direction of entry and the presence of the beveling.
Inferences based on knowledge of necessary causes (&quot;distinctive diagnostics&quot;)
are quite common in historical and forensic sciences, and often lead to
the detection of intelligent, as well as, natural causes. Since Criminal
X's fingers are the only known cause of Criminal X's fingerprints, X's prints
on the murder weapon incriminate him with a high degree of certainty. In
the same way, since intelligent design is the only known cause of information-rich
systems, the presence of information&oacute;including the information-rich
nucleotide sequences in DNA&oacute;implies an intelligent source. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Scientists
in many fields recognize the connection between intelligence and information
and make inferences accordingly. Archaeologists assume a mind produced the
inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone. Evolutionary anthropologists try to demonstrate
the intelligence of early hominids by arguing that certain chipped flints
are too improbably specified to have been produced by natural causes. N.A.S.A.'s
search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (S.E.T.I.) presupposed that information
imbedded in electromagnetic signals from space would indicate an intelligent
source. As yet, however, radio-astronomers have not found information-bearing
signals coming from space. But closer to home, molecular biologists have
identified encoded information in the cell. Consequently, a growing number
of scientists now suggest that the information in DNA justifies making what
probability theorist William Dembski and biochemist Michael Behe call &quot;the
design inference.&quot; </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Times">Conclusion<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></I></B><FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">During the last
forty years, molecular biology has revealed a complexity and intricacy of
design that exceeds anything that was imaginable during the late-nineteenth
century. We now know that organisms display any number of distinctive features
of intelligently engineered high-tech systems: information storage and transfer
capability; functioning codes; sorting and delivery systems; regulatory
and feed-back loops; signal transduction circuitry; and everywhere, complex,
mutually-interdependent networks of parts. Indeed, the complexity of the
biomacromolecules discussed in this essay does not begin to exhaust the
full complexity of living systems. As even the staunch materialist Richard
Dawkins has allowed, &quot;Biology is the study of complicated things that
give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Yet
the materialistic science we have inherited from the late-nineteenth century,
with its exclusive conceptual reliance on matter and energy, could neither
envision nor can it now account for the biology of the information age.
As Werner Gitt has said, throughout the natural sciences &quot;energy and
matter are considered to be basic, universal quantities. But the concept
of information has become just as fundamental and far reaching. . . information
has rightly become known as the third fundamental quantity.&quot; Or as
Norbert Weiner put it, &quot;Information is information, neither energy
nor matter. No materialism that fails to take account of this can survive
the present day.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">The molecular biology of
the cell raises the possibility that &quot;no materialism&quot; will survive
the revolution beginning to take root in science. While established journals
and institutions continue to propagate the orthodoxies of a generation ago,
many scientists, philosophers of science and mathematicians have begun to
challenge these views and to formulate alternative approaches. Recent work
in probability theory has defined information more precisely and articulated
clear mathematical criteria for the identification of intelligently designed
systems, thus providing a theoretical framework for a new science based
upon the reality of design. A new book on the &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;
of biochemical systems explains why gradual undirected evolution cannot
produce such systems, and suggests intelligent design as the most viable
scientific alternative. A new peer-reviewed journal, <I>Origins &amp; Design,</I>
opens this spring with a seminal article by a former chemical evolutionist
turned design-advocate. Other work promises to reshape our conception, not
only of living things but of our science and ourselves. If the simplest
life owes its origin to an intelligent Creator, then perhaps man is not
the &quot;cosmic orphan&quot; that twentieth century scientific materialism
has taught. Perhaps then, during the twenty first century, the traditional
moral and spiritual foundations of the West will find support from the very
sciences that once seemed to undermine them. </FONT><BR>

<P>	 <B>CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND - The 20th Century has witnessed an unprecedented
expansion of scientific knowledge. It has also seen episodes of human- rights
abuse unparalleled both in magnitude and cruelty.</B><BR>
<BR>
	 Even as the double-helix discovery, the quantum theory and the development
of a polio vaccine have manifested some of man's most ennobling capabilities,
the gulags and gas chambers have demonstrated with equal force that scientific
prowess alone does not confirm the existence of civilization--if civilization
is to be measured by a commitment to protecting human rights.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Indeed, in a great many places during the 20th Century, human rights have
been an imperiled commodity. Yet in every situation, the protections accorded
human rights have reflected what cultures and governments think about the
value and dignity of man. The scientific disciplines, which have increasingly
helped to define our century's view of mankind, have indirectly played an
important role in the discussion of human rights, precisely because man's
idea of man ultimately decides the respect such rights receive.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Human rights might be defined as the legal and political manifestation
of a culture's perception of human dignity. Yet cultures do not create human
dignity any more than governments create human rights; at best, societies
will acknowledge dignity by preserving rights. Former Harvard law professor
Harold J. Berman has detected this assumption at the heart of American constitutionalism.
In the United States, he notes, &quot;the fundamental rights of individual
persons exist independently of the state.&quot; Under Soviet Marxism, by
contrast, &quot;all rights are granted by the state and are inevitably subordinate
to (its) power.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 But which way should it be? Do human rights have validity apart from government
decree or are they merely granted by it?  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the Western tradition, human rights have been said to exist independently
of the state because they have been based upon human dignity. The American
Bill of Rights, for example, offers what Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. has called &quot;a sublime oration on the dignity of man.&quot;
The word dignity comes from the Latin dignitas, meaning &quot;glory.&quot;
Historically, Western society has derived its belief in the dignity of man
from its Judeo-Christian belief that man is the glory of God, made in his
image. According to this view, human rights depend upon the Creator who
made man with dignity, not upon the state. In the American formulation,
&quot;men . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Many educated citizens in the West, however, have abandoned the traditional
view of man and replaced it with a more contemporary scientific view--one
that promulgates a less exalted view of man. In purely material, scientific
terms, human beings are insignificant oddities cast up by chance in an immense
and impersonal universe. As British philosopher Bertrand Russell concluded,
&quot;Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they
were achieving&quot; and which, in turn, predestine him &quot;to extinction
in the vast death of the solar system.&quot; Such pessimism has persisted
despite the spectacular advances that have occurred in science during the
20th Century. Though Einsteinian and quantum concepts have revolutionized
accepted ideas of matter, space and time, science has discovered nothing
to elevate the modern view of man. In this modern scientific view, only
man's material complexity distinguishes him from the other biological structures
that inhabit the universe.  <BR>
<BR>
	 This loss of what is distinctively human will in time require either promoting
animals to the human estate, or more likely, relegating man to the level
of animals. UC Berkeley biologist Thomas H. Jukes has declared that in a
few years we will hear of &quot;the rights of bacteria,&quot; since all
that differentiates bacteria from humanity is a &quot;disparity in the length
and sequence of DNA molecules.&quot;  <BR>
	 Such predictions are not merely theoretical. Dolphin experiments prompted
John Lilly to say that &quot;the day that communication is established the
(dolphin) becomes a legal, ethical, moral and social problem.&quot; The
dolphin will have qualified for &quot;human rights.&quot; A court case in
California about a great ape that learned sign language further illustrates
the point. With research funds exhausted, the ape's teachers claimed that
because the ape had learned language, it qualified for legal protection
and that to return it to the zoo would be &quot;dehumanizing.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 While some researchers have &quot;personified&quot; their apes, others
have mechanized their concept of man. One Carnegie-Mellon robotics researcher
has suggested that those who deny the &quot;consciousness&quot; of his mobile
robots display a gross chauvinism in favor of their own form of mental machinery.
A conference at Yale last year on artificial intelligence produced several
informal discussions about the problem of defining the political rights
of &quot;thinking&quot; machines. In his widely read article in Science,
&quot;The New Biology: What Price Relieving Man's Estate?&quot; Leon R.
Kass of the University of Chicago wrote &quot;we are witnessing the erosion,
perhaps the final erosion, of the idea of man as something splendid or divine,
and its replacement with a view that sees man, no less than nature, as simply
more raw material for manipulation and homogenization. Hence our peculiar
moral crisis.&quot;  <BR>
<BR>
	 In the face of this situation, Western nations have signed the U.N. Declaration
of Human Rights. Most all still abide by its provisions. Without the concept
of &quot;the distinctively human,&quot; however, governments are inevitably
playing a global game of &quot;let's pretend.&quot; The most impassioned
appeals for human rights by politicians and scientists will mean nothing
if they have abandoned belief in the distinctive dignity of man. Without
this conviction there is no logical ground for supporting human rights in
the West or in the Soviet Union; there is no logical ground for human rights
at all. In such a context, those who advocate human rights practice species
chauvinism.  <BR>
<BR>
	 In response to such absurd but seemingly inescapable conclusions, some
have hoped that merely reiterating the Judeo-Christian doctrine of creation
will restore the grounds for preserving human dignity. But no doctrine can
give man dignity, let alone one that is no longer believed. No &quot;useful
fiction&quot; can rescue man from his current moral dilemma; for fictions
remain useful only as long as they are not regarded as such. Even so, Judaism
and Christianity do not teach that the doctrine of man's creation in the
Divine image establishes his dignity. They teach that the fact of man's
creation has established human dignity. Only if man is (in fact) a product
of special Divine purposes can his claim to distinctive or intrinsic dignity
be sustained. Indeed, if dignity is built into man by his Creator, then
certain rights are &quot;inalienable.&quot; Moreover it follows that if
man's dignity is a fact of his origin, human rights are independent of his
religious or philosophical convictions, just as they are independent of
the state. In short, if the traditional view of man's origin is correct,
people have human rights whether they believe they do or not.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Voltaire said that madness is to have erroneous perceptions and to reason
correctly from them. Historically, from the standpoint of human rights,
madness has prevailed in the Eastern Bloc under Soviet domination. Moreover,
the Soviet madness adheres to the pattern Voltaire described: Soviet indifference
to human rights is reasoned correctly from an erroneous perception of man
called Marxism--a materialist perception that Karl Marx himself held to
be scientific.  <BR>
<BR>
	 Yet we in the West with our own scientific view of man have created a
curious situation. The orthodoxy of Judaism and Christianity contends that
man has dignity because he has been created in the image of God. If the
orthodox view is false, as is now widely assumed in the academic and legal
professions, then one wonders how long it will be until we in the West reason
correctly from a strictly scientific perception of human nature.  <BR>
	 As renewed Soviet-American dialogue again raises the question of human
rights, we might well remember that neither the edifice of Western technical
sophistication nor the &quot;science&quot; of Marx can provide any firm
ground for asserting these rights. Instead, productive proclamations of
human rights depend upon a shared conviction that man's dignity is inherent--safe
from any political expedient--as our Western religious heritage once asserted.
 <BR>
<BR>
	 Public, and especially political, references to this heritage can doubtless
offend the sensibilities of a secular age. Yet if the traditional understanding
of man is correct, if it is not only doctrinal but factual, then governments
can derive human rights from a dignity that actually exists. But if the
traditional view is false and the modern scientific view prevails, then
there is no dignity and human rights are a delusion, not only in Moscow
but here in the West as well.<BR>

Except for the infamous condemnation of Galileo by  the medieval Catholic Church, there wasn't much fuss over Copernicus's  heliocentric theory of the solar system. Or Harvey's theory of the circulation  of the blood, or Newton's theory of gravitation, or Mendel's theory of  biological inheritance, or Einstein's theory of relativity. Only Darwin's  theory has provoked radical and enduring differences of opinion among large  numbers of people. Even now, almost a century and a half after it was first  proposed, it continues to be the focus of heated scientific disagreements,  bitterly contested court cases, and politically charged school board debates.</P>  <P>What is at stake in the creation-evolution controversies, and why do  they generate so much passion? What are the prospects for a resolution?</P>  <P>At the heart of the controversies is the question of our own origin:  Where did we come from, and why are we here? This question is important  because the answer to it affects how we lead our lives. Central to every  culture is an account of origins - and the creation-evolution controversies  represent the collision of two radically different accounts, each competing  for the minds of our children.</P>  <P>One reason the creation-evolution controversies have proven so difficult  to resolve is that they involve a number of very distinct issues, - some  primarily theological and some primarily scientific, - which are often  confused with each other. What follows is an attempt to sort out some of  these issues, place them in their historical context, and evaluate their  relative importance in the debate.</P>  <P>Not only are there many distinct issues, but there are also many parties  to the debate. For example, there are young-earth creationists who believe  that all things were created in approximately their present form a few  thousand years ago; there are other creationists who accept the geological  time scale but reject the notion that all living things are descended by  natural mechanisms from a common ancestor; there are theistic evolutionists  who accept common descent and evolution by natural mechanisms but maintain  that God acted through those mechanisms; there are evolutionists who see  no need for God's involvement but question one or more aspects of Darwin's  theory; and there are other evolutionists who substantially agree with  Darwin's theory and its atheistic implications. Even these five categories  (which, like most categories, are somewhat artificial) do not do justice  to the complexity of the controversies, but they will help to illustrate  it as the issues are laid out below.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>THEOLOGICAL ISSUES</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Chronology</P>  <P>According to Darwin's theory, all plants and animals have gradually  evolved from one or a few primitive life forms by the natural selection  of random variations. This process would require vast periods of time,  - at least hundreds of millions of years. According to Genesis 1, however,  God created the world in only six days; and if one adds up the time allotted  for other events in the Old Testament, one finds only about 4,000 years  between the creation of the world and the birth of Jesus. Clearly, Darwin's  theory conflicts with a literal reading of biblical chronology.</P>  <P>Suprisingly, this conflict played almost no role in the nineteenth-century  debates over evolution. Thirty years before Darwin published <I>The </I>Origin  of Species in 1859, geologists had already found convincing evidence that  the earth was much older than 6,000 years. Most Christians accepted the  evidence and modified their interpretation of scripture accordingly. Some  allowed for a gap of undetermined duration between the six days of creation  and subsequent events, while others interpreted the Genesis days as symbols  of long ages. The gap theory departed less from a literal reading, but  the day-age theory was more consistent with the scientific evidence, and  by 1859 the latter was widely accepted even among conservative Christians.</P>  <P>Even the American fundamentalists of the 1920's, for the most part,  did not insist on a literal interpretation of biblical chronology. In the  Scopes &quot;monkey trial&quot; of 1925, creationist lawyer William Jennings  Bryan announced that he accepted the antiquity of the earth and the day-age  interpretation of Genesis. It was not until the 1960's that biblical chronology  rose to prominence in the creation-evolution controversies, largely through  the influence of engineer Henry Morris and the Institute for Creation Research  in San Diego.</P>  <P>Today, many young-earth creationists feel that the word of God has been  so adulterated by modern criticism that nothing short of defending its  literal truth will suffice. Some of these (such as Morris) consider Genesis  a testable scientific theory, and call themselves &quot;scientific creationists.&quot;  Other young-earth creationists are less concerned with biblical literalism  than with the goodness of creation: if all evils are due to the fall of  Adam and Eve, then the extinctions we see in the fossil record must be  more recent.</P>  <P>A major difficulty for young-earth creationists is that geological chronology  is based on several independent lines of scientific evidence. By observing  the rates at which sediments are presently being deposited and then measuring  the thickness of older sedimentary rocks, geologists can estimate how long  it took for those rocks to form. Also, when geologists find radioactive  elements and their decay products in rocks they can measure their ratios  and estimate probable ages from observed radioactive decay rates.</P>  <P>Young-earth creationists object that such estimates assume that rates  of sedimentation and radioactive decay have remained constant, - assumptions  which are impossible to verify empirically. Evolutionists (and many creationists)  dismiss these objections as unwarranted and implausible, and maintain that  geological chronology is scientifically well-established.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Providence</P>  <P>For Christian theists, God not only created the world but also continues  to sustain it and govern it, - an affirmation known as the doctrine of  providence. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, some  Enlightenment philosophers (known as &quot;deists&quot;) maintained that  after the initial creation God turned the world loose to run by itself,  like a machine.</P>  <P>Deism has profound theological implications. If God is necessary only  to account for the initial creation of the universe, then all subsequent  phenomena, - even the events of human history, - are explicable without  reference to God. Jesus may have been an extraordinary person, but the  incarnation was a myth. Prayer may be psychologically comforting, but otherwise  has no effect. If God has turned the creation loose to run by itself, then  Christianity loses its doctrine of providence, - and much of its religious  content.</P>  <P>But theism has profound scientific implications. If the natural order  is subject to divine control or intervention, then worldly phenomena cannot  be completely explained without reference to God. Most scientists in Darwin's  day were theists; they relied on natural laws to explain ordinary phenomena  and the results of their experiments, but considered some things (such  as human origins and biblical miracles) beyond the reach of naturalistic  explanation. When Darwin proposed that the Creator originally breathed  life into one or a few forms and then left them to evolve by natural processes,  he encountered significant opposition from theistic scientists. Geologist  Charles Lyell, who championed the idea that natural history could be explained  by the uniform operation of natural causes, and biologist Alfred Russel  Wallace, who proposed a theory of evolution similar to Darwin's, both insisted  that the origin of human beings was a special case requiring divine intervention.</P>  <P>Today the majority of biologists are atheists who believe that God does  not exist and that naturalistic explanations are sufficient. Yet a significant  number of biologists still consider themselves theists. Most are not young-earth  creationists, but instead accept geological chronology and either (1) acknowledge  the operation of natural laws in ordinary phenomena but believe that the  history of life included successive creative acts by God, or (2) acknowledge  the uninterrupted operation of natural laws but believe that God somehow  works through those laws. Examples of the first include physicist Alan  Hayward and geologist John Wiester, and examples of the second include  physicist Howard Van Till and biologist Terry Gray. For the sake of discussion,  the first group can be called successive creationists and the second theistic  evolutionists, though not everyone would agree with these labels. Successive  creationists and theistic evolutionists are less likely to be found in  the Institute for Creation Research than in the American Scientific Affiliation,  a large organization of Christians who are also scientists.</P>  <P>Science, as it is now generally understood, is limited to naturalistic  explanations which can be empirically tested. Both successive creationists  and theistic evolutionists acknowledge this &quot;methodological naturalism,&quot;  but disagree over its applicability. Creationists criticize theistic evolutionists  for applying it to all phenomena without reservation, and thus abandoning  the doctrine of providence and being deists in disguise. Theistic evolutionists  reply that they continue to affirm God's providential control of natural  processes, even those which appear to be random. Creationists object that  this affirmation adds nothing to naturalistic explanations, and is thus  meaningless. Theistic evolutionists respond that successive creationists  tie Christian belief to a &quot;God of the gaps&quot; who is constantly  forced to retreat in the face of scientific progress.</P>  <P>Both groups, of course, reject metaphysical naturalism (the philosophical  doctrine that God does not exist and nature is all there is), but creationists  argue that the methodological naturalism of the theistic evolutionists  is practically indistinguishable from metaphysical naturalism. Creationists  thus charge theistic evolutionists with being accommodationists who let  themselves be used by atheists to make Darwinism more palatable to Christians.  Theistic evolutionists, however, see themselves as defending the reasonableness  of Christianity in a culture dominated by science.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Design</P>  <P>One of the most fundamental doctrines in Christianity is that God created  the universe by design, according to a pre-conceived plan. According to  the Bible, God created us in His image. Regardless of whether He was continually  involved in providential history (theism), or left the world to evolve  on its own (deism), God intended from the start to produce human beings  as the final outcome.</P>  <P>As a student Darwin had studied William Paley's <I>Natural Theology</I>  (1802), which argued that someone who finds a watch on the ground can logically  infer that it was made by a watchmaker. Paley's argument from design was  intended to prove the existence of God, but Darwin argued that what seemed  to be design in living organisms was really due to random variations and  survival of the fittest. In Darwin's view all species are contingent, and  as the latest product of an inherently contingent process the human species  is the most contingent of all.</P>  <P>When botanist Asa Gray suggested that God guided evolution by designing  variations, Darwin rejected the idea. In his 1868 <I>Variation of </I>Animals  and Plants Under Domestication, Darwin argued that biological variations  are like the stones which an architect finds at the base of a cliff and  assembles into a house. Although each stone is shaped by natural law, in  regard to the use to which they may be put their shapes are accidental.</P>  <P>Darwin's exclusion of design goes beyond the deistic claim that evolution  is due solely to natural processes. Theistic evolutionists (even if they  are deists on the question of providence, as their creationist critics  allege) affirm as Christians that human beings are designed by God. Therefore,  they either attribute evolution to non-Darwinian mechanisms or they accept  Darwin's theory but reject his anti-teleological interpretation of it.  Just as Darwin argued that features which appear to be designed are actually  contingent, so theistic evolutionists argue (like Asa Gray) that variations  which appear to be random are actually designed.</P>  <P>The most vocal advocates of design in the creation-evolution controversies,  however, are creationists rather than theistic evolutionists. The creationists's  arguments sometimes resemble Paley's; that is, design in living organisms  is used to prove the existence of God. Evolutionists object that such arguments  are unscientific because they invoke the supernatural, and point out that  Paley's teleological proof for God's existence has been discredited on  philosophical and theological grounds.</P>  <P>But there is a deeper issue involved. As John Henry Newman put it, Christians  believe in design because they believe in God, not in a God because they  see design. Christians may believe in God for any number of reasons (such  as faith in the Bible, or personal religious experiences); their belief  in God then leads them to the conclusion that living things are designed.  Darwin's theory denies that conclusion, and thus logically denies God's  existence.</P>  <P>In other words, the issue is not whether one can infer God from design,  but whether one can infer design in living things at all. Accordingly some  design advocates, more sophisticated than Paley, focus on design alone.  They point out that design inferences deal with agency, not with the supernatural,  and thus are not inherently unscientific. For example, a jury is not being  unscientific when it infers design in the commission of a crime. This approach  to design is used in the biology textbook <I>Of Pandas and People </I>(1993),  which has provoked heated controversy in some school districts. Critics  continue to object that design inferences cannot scientifically be applied  to living things, since only a supernatural agent could have designed them;  but design advocates counter that the nature of the designer is a separate  issue.</P>  <P>Meanwhile, evolutionists argue (like Darwin) that one can infer the  absence of design from biological evidence. Paleontologist George Gaylord  Simpson concludes in <I>The Meaning of Evolution</I> (1967) that the facts  of evolution show man to be the result of a purposeless process that did  not have him in mind. The subtitle of zoologist Richard Dawkins's <I>The  Blind </I>Watchmaker (1986) is &quot;Why the evidence of evolution reveals  a universe without design.&quot; Creationists such as law professor Phillip  E. Johnson object that using biological evidence to argue against design  or a designer is no more scientific than arguing for design or a designer,  and charge evolutionists with misusing science as a platform for their  atheistic beliefs.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Summary of the Theological Issues</P>  <P>Although biblical chronology is the most publicized theological issue  in the creation-evolution controversies, it is not the most central. Many  creationists and theistic evolutionists criticize young-earthers for their  stand on chronology, arguing that it is theologically unnecessary as well  as empirically untenable. A more important issue is whether God continues  to be providentially involved in the creation, or has turned it loose to  run by itself. Creationists insist that providence implies God's intervention  in natural events, while theistic evolutionists maintain that God's providence  underlies the natural causes which account for all pheneomena.</P>  <P>Even more important than providence is the issue of design. Christians  believe that the world was purposefully created, and that human beings  are the culmination of God's purpose. Creationists and theistic evolutionists  may disagree on other issues, but they are united in rejecting the Darwinian  claim that human beings are undesigned. By far the most important theological  question in the creation-evolution controversies is whether we are the  accidental by-product of purposeless mechanisms which did not have us in  mind, or the designed result of God's plan for creation.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>SCIENTIFIC ISSUES</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Genetics</P>  <P>Darwin observed that members of the same species differ from each other  in slight but sometimes significant ways. A breeder makes good use of these  differences by mating only those individuals with desirable characteristics.  After several generations such selection can produce dramatically different  breeds, and Darwin reasoned that if the process were extended indefinitely  it could produce separate species.</P>  <P>Darwin's theory required that the desired traits be heritable by the  offspring of the selected individuals. But he lacked a theory of heredity  to explain how this could happen, so his theory initially encountered opposition  from other scientists. Even after the re-discovery of Mendelian genetics  in 1900 Darwin's theory languished, since genetic mutations then seemed  to render natural selection unnecessary. Only in the 1920's and 1930's  did biologists successfully combine Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution,  and by the 1940's Darwin's theory re-emerged in the form of a &quot;modern  synthesis.&quot;</P>  <P>According to the modern synthesis: (1) organisms are composed of genetically  determined traits; (2) if a trait confers an advantage in the competition  for survival its gene is more likely than others to be transmitted to the  next generation; therefore (3) over the course of many generations the  advantageous gene (and its corresponding trait) will be found in a higher  proportion of individuals. In other words, evolution is explained as a  change in gene frequencies due to differential survival (i.e., natural  selection). The discovery of the structure and function of DNA in the 1950's  bolstered the modern synthesis by providing a molecular explanation for  how genes could determine traits, be inherited, and mutate to produce new  variations. Given its elegant simplicity and capacity to integrate evidence  from several fields, the modern synthesis continues to be widely accepted.</P>  <P>Nevertheless, a significant number of biologists find it inadequate.  In the 1970's geneticist Richard Lewontin reported that molecular analyses  of gene products in closely related species of fruit flies revealed no  correlation between gene frequencies and morphological differences. As  a result, some biologists (including Lewontin) are convinced that evolution  cannot be explained simply by changes in gene frequencies.</P>  <P>Some critics of the modern synthesis point out that artificial selection  reaches a limit beyond which no further change can be effected; even after  many generations of breeding, a dog is still a dog. Even if the theory  can explain small-scale &quot;microevolution&quot; within a single species  or between closely related species, some biologists doubt whether it can  explain large-scale &quot;macroevolution&quot; such as the emergence of  new body plans (e.g., vertebrates and invertebrates) or structural novelties  (e.g., eyes and wings). In the 1950's geneticist Richard Goldschmidt argued  that macroevolution could not be due to the gradual accumulation of small  changes but had to be the result of macromutations which produce large  changes in a single generation. Goldschmidt's ideas were not well received  at the time, but are now popular among some biologists (such as Stephen  Jay Gould) who doubt that the modern synthesis can explain macroevolution.  Other critics of Darwinian macroevolution (such as embryologist Brian Goodwin)  see complexity theory as a promising alternative.</P>  <P>The distinction between microevolution and macroevolution is important  in the creation-evolution controversies. According to the Bible, God created  the major types of living things (such as grass, trees, birds, whales,  cattle and people), but left open the possibility of diversification within  those major types. Therefore, most creationists have little or no problem  with microevolution, even when it is attributed to selective changes in  gene frequencies. The most celebrated example of Darwinian microevolution,  diversification of finch beaks on the Galapagos Islands, poses a challenge  only to those young-earth creationists who dispute the amount of time involved.  The second most celebrated example of microevolution, a change in the proportion  of light- and dark-colored moths due to industrial pollution in England,  doesn't even pose this challenge, since it occurred within our lifetime.</P>  <P>Major theological problems arise only when microevolution is extrapolated  to macroevolution. If all aspects of living things are due to changes in  gene frequencies resulting from differential survival, then features which  creationists attribute to design are reduced to products of natural mechanisms  which exclude design. But as creationists are quick to point out, the extrapolation  of Darwinian microevolution to macroevolution is rejected even by many  non-theistic biologists.</P>  <P>Such biologists, however, usually object to having their views cited  in defense of creationist arguments. They protest that although they may  doubt a particular theory of the process of macroevolution they do not  doubt the overall pattern of macroevolution. In their view the best alternative  to the modern synthesis is not creationism, but some form of non-Darwinian  evolution. According to theistic as well as non-theistic evolutionists,  the integrity of the scientific enterprise requires biologists to exclude  creationist explanations and persevere in their search for natural mechanisms.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Fossils</P>  <P>One important source of evidence for the pattern of macroevolution is  the fossil record, which shows clearly that the earth was once populated  by organisms different from those now living. According to Darwin, the  history of life is like a branching tree, with one or a few primitive forms  at its base and extant forms at the tips of its branches. Darwin's theory  implies that there are numerous transitional forms linking the various  stages in the history of life, but nineteenth-century scientists objected  that fossils of those transitional forms had not been found. Darwin anticipated  this objection, and attributed the absence of transitional forms to the  widely acknowledged imperfection of the fossil record. Many forms may not  have been preserved in the first place, and many which were preserved may  have been destroyed by subsequent erosion.</P>  <P>Subsequent fossil-collecting has turned up some species with features  intermediate between previously-known fossils or living organisms (e.g.,  birds with reptile-like teeth), and many evolutionary biologists are convinced  that the fossil record has confirmed Darwin's theory. Other biologists,  however, have come to the opposite conclusion: they are convinced that  the fossil record shows Darwin's model of gradual transitions to be largely  incorrect. According to paleontologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge,  the fossil record exhibits a pattern of &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot;  - fossils appear suddenly, persist unchanged for a time, then disappear.  The most dramatic example is the sudden appearance of most major categories  of living things in the early Cambrian (the first rocks in which abundant  fossils occur), but the same phenomenon occurs even on a smaller scale.</P>  <P>The theory of punctuated equilibria has convinced some biologists that  non-Darwinian mechanisms must be responsible for most fossil patterns.  Darwinian evolutionists maintain, however, that the absence of transitional  forms can still be explained by the imperfecton of the fossil record. Furthermore,  they argue, it would be theoretically possible for a new species to arise  fairly quickly through changes in gene frequencies if small numbers of  organisms became geographically isolated from the rest of the population;  upon returning to the original habitat, this new species would then seem  to appear suddenly in the fossil record. In other words, it is possible  to accept punctuated equilibria without abandoning Darwin's theory.</P>  <P>Creationists frequently cite punctuated equilibria in their arguments  against Darwinian evolution; some go so far as to claim that the fossil  evidence supports a creation model over Darwin's branching-tree model.  Like biologists who reject Darwinian macroevolution, however, biologists  who accept punctuated equilibria do not like to be used in support of creationist  arguments. They point out that they still agree on the fact of common descent,  which is the essential point of Darwin's branching tree model. Creationists  counter that the issue is not whether evolutionists agree on common descent,  but whether the evidence supports it. Evolutionists (theistic as well as  non-theistic) reply that common descent is the only scientific alternative  to divine intervention, and argue that it has been empirically established  on other grounds.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Homology</P>  <P>Biologists systematically classify organisms on the basis of their similarities  and dissimilarities. One has to be careful in choosing which similarities  to use, however; bats and butterflies use wings to fly through the air,  and whales and lobsters use horizontal tail flippers to propel themselves  through water, but classifying bats with butterflies and whales with lobsters  would overlook anatomical and physiological features which biologists consider  more important.</P>  <P>In the decades before Darwin's <I>Origin of Species</I>, biologists  used &quot;homology&quot; to refer to features which are structurally similar  even though they may perform dissimilar functions in different organisms  (such as the forelimbs of bats and whales), and &quot;analogy&quot; to  refer to features which perform similar functions in different organisms  but are structurally dissimilar (such as the wings of bats and butterflies).  Homologies justified similar classification, while analogies did not. The  resulting classification scheme was interpreted as a reflection of God's  plan for creation.</P>  <P>In Darwin's theory, however, the same classification scheme was re-interpreted  as the result of descent with modification. According to Darwin, the forelimbs  of bats and whales are similar not because they are created according to  a common plan but because they are inherited from a common ancestor. He  acknowledged that this did not resolve all cases of disputed classification,  but proposed that when in doubt the best guide is embryology; he considered  the common ancestry of the vertebrates, for example, to be demonstrated  by the striking similarity of their embryos at an early stage of development.</P>  <P>After 1859 homology was re-defined to mean similarity by common descent,  and many biologists turned from mere classification to the reconstruction  of &quot;phylogenies,&quot; or evolutionary histories of related organisms.  With the advent of molecular biology in the mid-twentieth century, DNA  sequences were added to the list of features which biologists could analyze  for homologies. Although (with rare and fragmentary exceptions) DNA is  available only from living organisms, it has become an important tool in  studying evolutionary patterns.</P>  <P>Some biologists, however, criticize the whole enterprise of inferring  ancestor-descendant relationships from similarities and dissimilarities.  In the 1960's some evolutionists (later dubbed &quot;cladists&quot;) argued  that according to Darwin's theory significant evolutionary changes occur  only when two lineages branch off from each other. Application of this  approach eventually led a few cladists to conclude that similarities and  differences among organisms can tell us nothing at all about ancestor-descendant  relationships. These &quot;transformed cladists&quot; (such as zoologist  Colin Patterson) are now critical of all attempts to reconstruct phylogenies  on the basis of homology.</P>  <P>Other biologists (mostly embryologists such as Brian K. Hall) criticize  the concept of homology itself. They point out that there are now at least  three definitions of the word: morphological homology (based on structural  similarity), phylogenetic homology (based on common descent), and embryological  homology (based on similarity of developmental pathways). Often, features  which are homologous by one definition are not homologous by the other  two. For example, octopus eyes and human eyes are structurally similar  but they are not derived from a common ancestral eye and their developmental  pathways are different, so they are morphologically homologous but phylogenetically  and embryologically non-homologous. Vertebrate forelimbs exhibit similar  skeletal patterns which are presumed to be inherited from a common ancestor,  yet their detailed developmental pathways are different, making them morphologically  and phylogenetically homologous but embryologically non-homologous.</P>  <P>Since phylogenetic homology presupposes common descent and thus cannot  be used to prove it, and since morphological and embryological homology  so often fail to coincide, inferring ancestor-descendant relationships  from homology is fraught with difficulties. Some creationists point to  these difficulties to demonstrate that the evidence for common descent  is disputed. Evolutionists respond that they remain convinced of common  descent, and challenge creationists to come up with a scientific alternative  which does not invoke divine creation. Creationists counter that this begs  the question, since the issue is whether naturalistic explanations are  adequate or need to be supplemented by explanations based on design and  creation. Evolutionists (theistic as well as non-theistic) reply that acts  of God have no place in science.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Summary of the Scientific Issues</P>  <P>According to the modern synthesis, evolution is caused by a change in  gene frequencies due to natural selection. Some biologists consider this  sufficient to account for all aspects of evolution, while others consider  it inadequate, especially as an account of large-scale macroevolution.  Despite this dispute over the process of evolution most biologists consider  the pattern of evolution to be well-established, primarily by evidence  from the fossil record and homology. Nevertheless, some biologists question  whether the pattern in the fossil record conforms to Darwin's gradualist  model of the history of life, while others question the use of homologies  to reconstruct ancestor-descendant relationships. Even these critics of  evolutionary theory, however, generally agree that living things are descended  from a common ancestor by natural mechanisms.</P>  <P>Creationists often cite disagreements among biologists to show that  Darwinian evolution is untrue, or at least unproved; some go so far as  to claim that the evidence demonstrates divine creation instead. Most biologists,  however, object to being used in support of creationist arguments, pointing  out that they all agree on common descent by natural mechanisms. Furthermore,  they argue, the integrity of the scientific enterprise requires them to  exclude divine intervention and rely on natural mechanisms to explain the  history of life.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>**********</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>PROSPECTS FOR RESOLUTION</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Various polls have shown that only about 10% of the American people  accept Darwinian evolution; the remaining 90% are almost evenly divided  between young-earth creationists and those who believe that God was the  guiding force in the history of life. In other words, the vast majority  of Americans believe that we are the designed result of God's creative  activity, and that we should conduct our lives accordingly. Yet the only  view of human origins that can legally be taught in public schools is that  we are accidental by-products of purposeless natural processes, with survival  being the main criterion for how we conduct our lives. The ensuing controversies  are not only about creation and evolution, but also about who gets to teach  what to our children.</P>  <P>How can the controversies be resolved? Scientific creationists think  they can resolve them by requiring that Genesis be taught alongside Darwinian  evolution as a scientific theory. But this is unlikely to work, not only  because the courts prohibit it as an establishment of religion, but also  because it flies in the face of the available evidence and the way a great  many Christians interpret scripture. Some Darwinians think they can resolve  the controversies by calling evolution a fact. But this is unlikely to  carry the day, because except for the facts that (1) living things today  are different from those in the past and (2) it is possible to modify a  species by selection, virtually all of the evidence is interpreted in conflicting  ways among biologists themselves. Any reasonably neutral observer can see  that Darwinian macroevolution is a disputed theory, not an empirical fact.</P>  <P>When evolutionists say they agree on the &quot;fact&quot; of evolution,  they generally mean they agree on common descent and evolution by natural  mechanisms. Their conflicting interpretations of the evidence, however,  show that this agreement is at the level of philosophical commitment rather  than empirical inference. Like all scientists they share a commitment to  methodological naturalism: scientific explanations must exclude supernatural  causes and rely entirely on natural mechanisms. But unlike most pre-Darwinian  scientists, evolutionists believe that naturalistic explanations can account  for all phenomena in the history of life (even though we may not yet have  those explanations in hand).</P>  <P>Theistic evolutionists hope to resolve the controversies by affirming  this extension of methodological naturalism without surrendering belief  in God. But this is unlikely to work, because once they grant naturalistic  explanations such unlimited scope most of their non-theistic colleagues  regard their theistic beliefs as harmless and irrelevant, while most of  their creationist colleagues regard them as deists and accommodationists.</P>  <P>So although theistic evolutionists see themselves as mediators, they  do not occupy the common ground which could, potentially, resolve the creation-evolution  controversies.</P>  <P>What is that common ground? One feature of it must be, certainly, the  non-establishment of religion. Fortunately, all parties to the controversies  acknowledge the value of this. Even scientific creationists, who are regarded  by evolutionists as attempting to establish Christian fundamentalism, are  primarily rebelling against the establishment of atheism. As evolution  is currently taught in public schools, it frequently includes the claim  that we are accidental by-products of purposeless processes that did not  have us in mind. By any standard this claim has religious content, yet  the opposite viewpoint is systematically excluded from the classroom on  the grounds that it is religious rather than scientific. But evolutionists  who want to argue against divine purpose while claiming constitutional  immunity from counterarguments are like tennis players who won't let their  opponents hit the ball; eventually, the spectators and referees are going  to throw them off the court. If they want to continue teaching evolutionary  biology without creationist interference, then they would do well to avoid  theology.</P>  <P>Another feature of the common ground is limited methodological naturalism.  All parties to the creation-evolution controversies acknowledge the value  of explanations based on natural mechanisms; not even scientific creationists  expect biologists to attribute experimental results to divine intervention.  Methodological naturalism does not generate controversy, - only its axiomatic  extension to all phenomena, past as well as present. Students must be taught  that science is the search for naturalistic explanations, - it would be  a serious disservice to teach them otherwise, - but does that mean they  must be taught that science is omnipotent? Perhaps it would be wiser to  rear them to be like the great scientists of the past, who cultivated a  profound respect for the limits of their discipline and the limitless mystery  of the cosmos.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="46" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image51.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="59" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

One of these is a conflict over design.  According to the received view, the root of the conflict is that Darwinism  undermines the argument that God's existence can be proved from design  in living things.</P>  <P>It seems to me that there is a basic conflict between Christianity and  Darwinism on the issue of design. In my view, however, the source of the  conflict is not the argument that God's existence can be proved from design,  but something far more serious. The purpose of this essay is to analyze  the logical function of design in the controversy between Christianity  and Darwinism.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Christianity</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>As used in the following discussion, &quot;Christianity&quot; refers  to the mainstream theological traditions of the Eastern Orthodox, Roman  Catholic, and Protestant branches of Christianity. To make the discussion  manageable, I have chosen two representative theologians from each branch:  Athanasius and Maximus from Orthodoxy; Augustine and Aquinas from Catholicism;  and Luther and Calvin from Protestantism. The only issue of interest here  is design: how does design function in the thought of these representative  theologians?</P>  <P>The first noteworthy observation is that arguments for the existence  of God from design in the creation are almost completely absent. Aquinas,  to be sure, referred in his <I>Summa Theologiae</I> to the tendency of  natural bodies to act for ends, as a way to prove the existence of God;  and he referred in his <I>Summa Contra Gentiles</I> to the argument that  God's existence can be proved from the general order of the world.1 In  the context of Aquinas' work as a whole, however, these references are  isolated and almost insignificant. Indeed, it has been argued that Aquinas  did not advocate a natural theology at all, but was merely cataloging arguments  used by others.2 Likewise, although Calvin wrote that God &quot;daily discloses  himself in the whole workmanship of creation,&quot; he considered the disclosure  to be &quot;in vain&quot; (because of the fall) without the &quot;spectacles&quot;  of scripture.3</P>  <P>In fact, the argument for God's existence from design in the creation  was something of an aberration in the history of Christian theology, its  prominence being limited to Anglo-American thought from the end of the  seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century. References  to design are prominent in the history of Christian theology, but not as  premises in proofs for the existence of God. Instead, design consistently  functions as a conclusion which follows from the nature of God. God's existence  thus implies design, rather then vice versa.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>For example, Athanasius affirmed, in opposition to Arianism, that the  full divinity of the Logos is the basic starting point for all Christian  theology. This means that the generation of the Logos must not have been  an act of God's will, as though God could have chosen to be without the  Logos or as though there could have been a time when the Logos did not  exist. To be fully divine, the Logos must have been generated not by will  but by nature: &quot;A man by counsel builds a house, but by nature he  begets a son; and what is in building began to come into beginning at will,  and is external to the maker; but the son is proper offspring of the father's  essence, and is not external to him.&quot; Therefore, the fundamental difference  between the Logos and the creation is that the former is eternally generated  by nature, from God's own substance; while the latter is produced by an  act of God's will, and has a beginning in time.4</P>  <P>The creation, then, unlike the Logos, is the result of divine counsel  or deliberation. Athanasius emphatically rejected the notion that &quot;things  have come into being of themselves, and in chance fashion,&quot; or that  things have originated independently of purpose. On the contrary, &quot;counselling  goes before things which once were not, as in the case of all creatures,&quot;  and the Son &quot;is Himself the Living Counsel of the Father, by which  all things have come to be.&quot; The Son, however, like the Father, is  &quot;unalterable and unchangeable&quot;; so the divine counsel is eternal,  and God's will and purpose were with God &quot;before the world.&quot;  Whatever exists is thus preceded by &quot;its pattern in God.&quot;5</P>  <P>Athanasius maintained that God's creatorship, like God's providence,  extended to small details: &quot;If then it be not unworthy of God to exercise  His Providence, even down to things so small, a hair of the head, and a  sparrow, and the grass of the field, also it was not unworthy of Him to  make them. For what things are the subjects of His Providence, of those  He is Maker through his proper Word.&quot;6 Since God's providence and  creatorship extend &quot; even down to things so small,&quot; they extend  <I>a fortiori</I> to the human species. God not only &quot;fashioned the  race of men&quot; in &quot;His own image,&quot; but also foresaw the fall  and provided for redemption: just as a wise architect would make provisions  for repairing a house &quot;should it any time become dilapidated,&quot;  so &quot;in the same way prior to us is the repair of our salvation founded  in Christ.&quot;</P>  <P>In other words, the incarnation of the Logos in a human body was predestined  from eternity. Christ's body, which &quot;is of no different sort from  ours,&quot;was thus made, at the proper time, according to God's eternal  plan.7</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Maximus the Confessor, in opposition to Origen's implicit claim that  God creates by necessity, relied on the Athanasian distinction between  nature and will to reaffirm God's freedom. According to Maximus, the<I>  logoi</I>, or patterns, of all creatures exist eternally in the mind of  God, but they are the products of God's will rather than God's nature.  At the appropriate time, God creates substantial realities according to  their pre-existent <I>logoi</I>, which are thus the bases for diversity  and movement in the corporeal universe. Therefore, all things are the intended  products of God's creative act. This does not mean that every detail of  every being conforms perfectly to its pe-existent <I>logos</I>. Maximus  allowed for some variation due to the <I>tropos</I>, or mode of existence,  which affects the extent to which a being actualizes its eternal and unchanging  <I>logos</I>. Nevertheless, by affirming that God's will is the origin  not only of all created beings, but also of their pre-existent patterns,  Maximus safeguarded God's sovereignty and purposefulness.8</P>  <P>Human beings, in particular, are created according to the will of God.  Whereas Origen had taught that human bodies were the result of the fall  of pre-existent souls, Maximus held that God creates body and soul together.  Though body and soul are distinguishable, they are inseparable, and only  together do they form a complete species. The one constitutive factor for  both is the will of God, whose divinity is reflected in the psycho-physical  unity of the whole human being, and not just the soul.9 According to Maximus,  the human being is designed to be a microcosm in which the mental, spiritual,  and physical aspects of creation are united. Furthermore, this microcosm  is intended to unite with, and partake of, the divine nature, thereby uniting  the world with its creator. This cosmic union, which is finally achieved  in the incarnation of the Logos in Christ, is the fulfillment of God's  original purpose for creating the universe. The incarnation was thus foreordained,  independently of the fall, from eternity.10</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Augustine, opposing the cosmogonic dualism of the Manicheans, affirmed  that the creator of all that exists is God: &quot;Whatever is, since it  is, and in whatever degree it is, has its existence from the one God.&quot;  In defense of God's sovereignty, Augustine insisted that all created beings  have their forms or <I>rationes aeternae</I> in &quot;the very mind of  the Creator.&quot; All things are thus made according to God's eternal  and unchanging plan: &quot;Because therefore the Word of God is One, by  which all things were made, which is the unchangeable truth, all things  are simultaneously therein, potentially and unchangeably; not only those  things which are now in this whole creation, but also those which have  been and those which shall be.&quot; In other words, &quot;the Wisdom of  God, by which all things have been made contains everything according to  design before it is made.&quot;11</P>  <P>According to Augustine, God's creatorship extends to all forms of existence:  &quot;even the lowest form is of God. And the same may be said of species.&quot;  The &quot;lowliest and the smallest creatures are obviously fashioned by  such a remarkable plan that a moment's serious attention to them fills  the beholder with inexpressible awe and wonder&quot;; and if they appear  to us to be tiny and contemptible, it may only be that &quot;on account  of our pride, God appointed that tiny and contemptible creature to torment  us.&quot; But if God's design extends even to the lowest forms of life,  it extends <I>a fortiori</I> to human beings, who were &quot;certainly&quot;  created in the form which God foreordained &quot;before the ages.&quot;12</P>  <P>Although it is not completely clear whether Augustine believed that  foreordination extends to the precise form of every individual, it is clear  that Augustine considered human beings and every other kind of creature  to be designed by God: &quot;all things are created on a rational plan,  and man not by the same rational plan as horses, for it is absurd to think  this. Therefore individual things are created in accord with <I>rationes</I>  unique to them.&quot;13</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Aquinas endeavored to synthesize Christian theology with Aristotelian  philosophy. Since Augustine's notion of the <I>rationes aeternae</I> was  borrowed from the Neoplatonists (though unlike Plato or the Neoplatonists,  Augustine placed the ideas in the mind of the supreme deity), and since  Aristotle had rejected the Platonic doctrine of ideas, it might be expected  that Aquinas would reject the Augustinian doctrine of ideas. Quite to the  contrary, however, Aquinas considered it &quot;necessary to suppose ideas  in the divine mind,&quot; just as &quot;the likeness of a house pre-exists  in the mind of the builder.&quot; According to Aquinas, things receive  their determinate forms because &quot;in the divine wisdom are the types  of all things, which types we have called ideas, i.e., exemplar forms existing  in the divine mind.&quot;14</P>  <P>The fact that Aquinas' view of the divine ideas resembles Augustine's,  however, does not mean that Aquinas merely incorporated the doctrine in  his theology out of respect for authority. Although the language may be  borrowed from Augustine, the concept follows directly from central aspects  of Aquinas' doctine of God. First, it follows from God's intelligent, purposeful,  and free creatorship. Since &quot;the world was not made by chance, but  by God acting by His intellect,&quot; therefore &quot;there must exist  in the divine mind a form to the likeness of which the world was made.  And in this the notion of idea consists.&quot; The doctrine safeguards  God's intelligent purposefulness, since it necessarily implies previous  planning in the production of creatures, and &quot;those who say that all  things happen by chance cannot admit the existence of ideas.&quot; It also  safeguards God's freedom, in opposition to the notion that the world emanates  by necessity from God's nature. Creatures pre-exist in God's nature only  &quot;after the mode of intellect,&quot; but they &quot;proceed from Him  after the mode of will.&quot; Since &quot;a form considered by the intellect  does not move or cause anything except through the will,&quot; it is God's  free will and not God's nature which determines what is actually created.15</P>  <P>Second, the doctrine of ideas is implied in the doctrine of the trinity,  since &quot;in the Word is implied the operative idea of what God makes.&quot;  Just as there &quot;pre-exists in the mind of a craftsman a certain image  of his external work,&quot; so also does there &quot;pre-exist in the mind  of one who pronounces an exterior word a certain archetype of it.&quot;  This archetype, or &quot;interior word,&quot; is the word of God; and the  ideas of things to be made are thus metaphorically called the word of God.  Aquinas interpreted the prologue to the Gospel of John accordingly: &quot;In  the beginning was the Word&quot; means the things originate from God's  intellect and purpose, &quot;and not from chance.&quot;16</P>  <P>In particular, the human species was delibrately designed by God. Although  it is possible that some species distinctions do not have their source  in the divine ideas, Aquinas maintains that the human soul is &quot;made  to the image of God,&quot; and that &quot;God fashioned the human body&quot;  in order to &quot;make it suitably proportioned to the soul.&quot;17</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Luther considered the essential teaching of the Old and New Testaments  to be our total dependence on God in Christ. Our total dependence on God,  in turn, presupposes that we owe our very existence to God as our creator.18  For God to be the creator means, for Luther, that &quot;the creation is  not fortuitous but the exclusive work of divine forsight.&quot; From all  eternity, God &quot;has a Word, a speech, a thought, or a conversation  with Himself in His divine heart&quot;; and from this conversation, &quot;heaven  and earth, all creatures, both the visible and the invisible, come into  being.&quot; Therefore, &quot;all His works are some words of God, created  by the uncreated Word.&quot; Since God creates out of nothing, which means  without the need for any instrumentality or pre-existing material, Luther  considers creation to be &quot;a kind of birth.&quot; This birth, however,  takes place &quot;at the command of God,&quot; as a product of God's will  rather than as a pantheistic emanation from God's nature. But Luther is  less concerned with issues such as this than he is with the immediate significance  of the doctrine of creation for the faith of the believer: we should know,  for example, that even &quot; great sea animals&quot; are created by God,  &quot;lest we be frightened;&quot; then &quot;we may more readily believe  that God can preserve us too, even though we are far smaller beings.&quot;  Similarly, according to Luther, God tells us in Isaiah 40:28, &quot;I have  made all these things, they are my creatures, they are under My control,  they cannot touch the least hair of your head. Do not be afraid.&quot;  God's creatorship, then, means that &quot;we must take note of God's power  that we may be completely without doubt about the things which God promises  in His word.&quot;19</P>  <P>It is not merely the initial creation of the universe which demonstrates  God's power. Luther explained that God is not like a carpenter who &quot;turns  over the house to its owner&quot; when he finishes constructing it; instead,  God &quot;continues to preserve His creation through the Word.&quot; In  fact, &quot;if the Creator, who continues to work forever and ever, and  His Co-worker were to interrupt Their work, all would go to wrack and ruin  in a twinkling.&quot; Luther draws from this the lesson that &quot;as we  human beings did not create ourselves, so we can do nothing at all to keep  ourselves alive for a single moment by our own power. The fact that I grow  and develop is God's work alone,&quot; and Luther meant this in the strongest  possible sense. He even interpreted Isaiah 44:24 as being equivalent to  a statement by God that &quot;whatever is done, I alone have done it.&quot;20  Modern commentators point out that, for Luther, God is thus the only true  agent. God does absolutely everything, and whatever happens is a direct  result of God's activity. Therefore, created beings are what Luther calls  <I>larva dei</I>, or visible masks of the invisible God, testifying to  God's omnipresent power, and encouraging us to &quot;fear and trust only  in God.&quot;21</P>  <P>Given Luther's belief that God does all and creatures can do nothing,  it is unlikely that he would attribute even the smallest detail of creation  to anything other than God's purposeful activity. Among the forms of life  that he specifically attributes to God's design are &quot;herbs and trees,&quot;  which were created &quot;for our sustenance.&quot; He also considers the  mouse to be &quot;created by the Word of God with a definite plan in view,&quot;  so that &quot;here, too, we admire God's creation and workmanship.&quot;  Furthermore, &quot;the same thing can be said about flies.&quot; Above  all, however, man and woman were &quot;created by the special plan and  providence of God,&quot; specifically &quot;for the knowledge and worship  of God.&quot;22</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Calvin considered the creation a &quot;theater of the divine glory,&quot;  but because of the fall &quot;we have not the eyes to see this unless they  be illumined by the inner revelation of God through faith.&quot; Once we  have been given the &quot;spectacles&quot; of scripture, however, &quot;the  most perfect way of seeking God&quot; is &quot;to contemplate him in his  works.&quot; Through the eyes of faith the believer sees design in the  creation, which then nourishes that faith in return. Thus &quot;although  it is not the chief evidence for faith, yet it is the first evidence in  the order of nature, to be mindful that wherever we cast our eyes, all  things they meet are works of God, and at the same time to ponder with  pious meditation to what end God created them.&quot;23</P>  <P>Of all God's works, the &quot;most excellent example&quot; is humankind.  Calvin interprets the &quot;let us make man&quot; of Genesis 1:26 as God's  way of &quot;commending to our attention the dignity of our natures,&quot;  since God made all other creatures by command, but &quot;enters into consult-ation&quot;  before making us. Furthermore, human beings are created in the divine image,  the &quot;chief seat&quot; of which is in the mind and heart, though some  &quot;scintillations&quot; shine in every part, including the body. Human  beings are especially created &quot;to seek God&quot; and &quot;to behold  the works of God,&quot; and they are endowed with reason and under-standing  &quot;that they might acknowledge their Creator.&quot; The rest of the  universe, in turn, was &quot;established especially for the sake of mankind.&quot;  According to Calvin, &quot;the world was originally created for this end,  that every part of it should tend to the happiness of man.&quot; God &quot;filled  the earth, waters, and air with living things, and brought forth an abundance  of fruits,&quot; and thereby &quot;shows his wonderful goodness toward  us.&quot;24</P>  <P>Calvin emphasized that God not only created but also preserves and governs  the world. In fact, according to Calvin, God completely controls all events.  Without denying the existence of secondary causes, Calvin nevertheless  insisted that &quot;nothing happens except what is knowingly and willingly  decreed&quot; by God. Calvin specifically objected not only to those who  would &quot;substitute nature for God&quot; by making nature &quot;the  artificer of all things,&quot; but also to those who would attribute anything  less than absolute control to God. Included in this latter category are  people who &quot;in place of God's providence sub-stitute bare permission  - as if God sat in a watchtower awaiting chance events,&quot; as well as  people who attribute to God a providence which merely &quot;by a general  motion revolves and drives the system of the universe&quot; but which &quot;does  not specifically direct the action of in-dividual creatures.&quot; For  Calvin, God &quot;so regulates all things that nothing takes place without  his deliberation,&quot; and &quot;not one drop of rain falls without God's  sure command.&quot; What may appear to be a chance occurrence is &quot;only  that of which the reason and cause are secret,&quot; and the secret cause  is God's foreordination. Though &quot;for us they are fortuitous,&quot;  such events are &quot;governed by God's incom-prehensible plans.&quot;25  Since there is no such thing as chance, accord-ing to Calvin, God must  have designed every detail of every living thing.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>This survey of representative theologians demonstrates that design was  important to all of them. It was not important, however, as a reason for  believing in God; instead, it followed as a logical conse-quence from their  understanding of God's nature. In a sense, they used, not an argument <I>from</I>  design, but an argument <I>to</I> design. Although they differed in their  notions of what creatures, exactly, were designed by God, they all agreed  that human beings were designed, and that this claim is central to Christian  belief.</P>  <P>In Christian theology, then, two fundamentally different design arguments  can be distinguished:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Argument <I>From</I> Design</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If human beings are designed, then God exists.</P>  <P>Human beings are designed.</P>  <P>Therefore, God exists.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>The Argument <I>To</I> Design</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>If God exists, then human beings are designed.</P>  <P>God exists.</P>  <P>Therefore, human beings are designed.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In a discussion of Darwinism, it is important to note that the logical  consequences of <I>denying </I>design differ radically in the case of these  two arguments. It would be illogical, for example, to conclude from a denial  of design, via the argument <I>from</I> design, that God does not exist:  this would be the fallacy of denying the antecedent. On the other hand,  it follows necessarily (by <I>modus tollens) </I>that a denial of design,  in the argument <I>to</I> design, is tantamount to a denial of God's existence.  Since the argument <I>to</I> design is prominent in the mainstream theological  traditions of Christianity, any theory which denies that human beings are  designed would amount, for those traditions, to an affirmation of atheism.  (This was the reasoning used by Princeton theologian Charles Hodge in his  1874 book, <I>What Is </I>Darwinism?)26</P>  <P>The question, then, is: does Darwinism claim that human beings are not  designed?</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Darwinism</B></P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>It is well known that Charles Darwin did not originate the notion of  evolution. Etymologically, &quot;evolution&quot; means &quot;unrolling,&quot;  and it was first used in biology about two centuries ago to refer to the  development of an embryo. As used in modern biology, however, evolution  refers in its most general sense to the origin and diversifica-tion of  living organisms, in which later stages are somehow descended or derived  from earlier ones. Although Darwin contributed to the wide acceptance of  biological evolution by adducing a large amount of evidence for it, his  principal contribution was to propose a theory about its mechanism. Since  the general phenomenon of evolution is distinct from any particular theory  about its mechanism, one may be an evolutionist without being a Darwinist  (as, for example, Lamarck was an evolutionist before Darwin.)</P>  <P>As used in the following discussion, Darwinism refers to the theory  set forth by Charles Darwin himself in the various editions of <I>The Origin  of </I>Species, The Descent of Man, The Variation of Plants and Animals  Under <I>Domestication</I>, and in his correspondence. Darwin's theory  ascribes evolution to the natural selection of small variations which occur  among the individuals in any given species. According to the theory, those  variations are random with respect to the fitness of the in-dividual or  to the direction of evolution (i.e., they do not arise in response to the  needs of an organism or in accordance with any plan), and any given environment  &quot;selects&quot; (in a manner analogous to a breeder of plants or livestock)  those individuals whose variations render them more likely to survive (i.e.,  natural selection is survival of the fittest).</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Harvard botanist Asa Gray, Darwin's most influential ally in nineteenth-century  America, defended every aspect of Darwin's <I>Origin of </I>Species except  its apparent exclusion of design. Gray believed that naturalists are justified  in seeing design in the variations which give rise to species, and he advised  Darwin to assume &quot;that variation has been led along certain beneficial  lines. Streams flowing over a sloping plain by gravitation (here the counterpart  of natural selec-tion) may have worn their actual channels as they flowed;  yet their particular courses may have been assigned.&quot; Gray also compared  variations to raindrops: those which fall into the ocean &quot;are as much  without a final cause as the incipient varieties which come to nothing!  Does it therefore follow that the rains which are bestowed upon the soil  with such rule and average regularity were not designed to support vegetable  and animal life?&quot; Gray did not insist, however, that all variations  must be designed: &quot;the accidental element may play its part in Nature  without negativing design in the theist's view.&quot; Indeed, the accidental  element in Darwin's theory is the basis of its advantage in explaining  useless or harmful adaptations. But Gray was convinced that useful adaptations  testify to design: since natural selection merely picks out variations  which are independently presented to it, the presence of design in the  result indicates that at least some variations are designed.27</P>  <P>Darwin disagreed. He wrote to Gray that he was &quot;charmed&quot; with  the stream metaphor, but he concluded his next book, <I>The Variation of  Plants </I>and Animals Under Domestication, with a lengthy refutation of  Gray's position.28 Using the metaphor of a house built by an architect  utilizing uncut fragments of stone, Darwin explained that &quot;the frag-ments  of stone, though indispensable to the architect, bear to the edifice built  by him the same relation which the fluctuating variations of each organic  being bear to the varied and admirable structures ultimately acquired by  its modified descendants.&quot; The shape of each fragment &quot;may be  called accidental, but this is not strictly correct; for the shape of each  depends on a long sequence of events, all obeying natural laws.&quot; Nevertheless,  &quot;in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put, their shape  may be strictly said to be accidental.&quot; In Darwin's metaphor, of course,  the architect is natural selection.29 Darwin continued:</P>  <P>Can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator intentionally ordered,  if we use the words in any ordinary sense, that certain fragments of rock  should assume certain shapes so that the builder might erect his edifice?  If the various laws which have determined the shape of each fragment were  not predeter-mined for the builder's sake, can it with any greater probability  be maintained that He specially ordained for the sake of the breeder each  of the innumerable variations in our domestic animals and plants; - many  of these variations being of no service to man, and not beneficial, far  more often injurious, to the creatures themselves? Did He ordain that the  crop and tail-feathers of the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier  might make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He cause the frame  and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be  formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the bull for  man's brutal sport? But if we give up the principle in one case - if we  do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog were intentionally  guided in order that the greyhound, for instance, that perfect image of  symmetry and vigor, might be formed - no shadow of reason can be assigned  for the belief that variations, alike in nature and the result of the same  general laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection  of the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world, man  included, were intentionally and specially guided.30</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>In his correspondence, Darwin elaborated on his claim that varia-tions  could not be designed. His reasoning can be divided into three -categories:  scientific, philosophical, and theological. The first category includes  the observation that the vast majority of variations are useless or harmful  rather than beneficial. It thus makes no sense to Darwin to say that variations  are designed: if someone says &quot;God ordained that at some time and  place a dozen slight variations should arise, and that one of them alone  should be preserved in the struggle for life and the other eleven should  perish in the first or first few generations, then the saying seems to  me mere verbiage. It comes to merely saying that everything that is, is  ordained.&quot; The second category of reasons includes the philosophical  assumption that naturalistic science is competent to investigate and explain  the origin of species. The idea that &quot;each variation has been providentially  arranged seems to me to make Natural Selection entirely superfluous, and  indeed takes the whole case of the appearance of new species out of the  range of science.&quot; The third category includes Darwin's conviction  that designing each slight variation would be beneath God's dignity and  contrary to God's benevolence. Referring once again to the breeding of  domestic pigeons, Darwin notes that &quot;it seems preposterous that a  maker of the universe should care about the crop of a pigeon solely to  please man's silly fancies.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;I cannot persuade  myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created  the <I>Ichneumonidae</I> with the express intention of their feeding within  the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.  Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly  designed.&quot;31</P>  <P>Darwin reasons that unless all variations are designed, none of them  are. If the &quot;interposition of the Deity&quot; is uncalled for in the  case of domestic variations, he could &quot;see no reason whatever for  believing in such interpositions in the case of natural beings.&quot; Or  &quot;if anything is designed, certainly man must be,&quot; but Darwin  &quot;cannot admit that man's rudimentary mammae...were designed,&quot;  therefore (by implica-tion) man is not designed. Such all-or-nothing reasoning  seems to be based primarily on Darwin's commitment to naturalistic explanation:  either the origin of species can be explained in exclusively naturalistic  terms, or it cannot really be explained at all. Darwin writes that he &quot;would  give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural Selection, if it requires  miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.&quot; To a lesser extent,  his reasoning may have been based on his understanding of the idea of God:  if the deity were going to pre-ordain <I>any</I> details, then an omnipotent  and omniscient deity would presumably pre-ordain<I> all</I>; but a wise  and benevolent deity would not ordain many of the details which are actually  observed; therefore (by implication), <I>no</I> details are pre-ordained.  Whatever the basis, Darwin's reasoning leads him to conclude that<I> all</I>  variations are undesigned.32</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Darwin also denies that natural selection, the second major ele-ment  in his theory, could lead to designed results. Although he compares natural  selection to an architect, he repeatedly denies that he intends to attribute  conscious agency to it. He repudiates the anthropomorphic connotations  which many of his contemporaries associate with the selection metaphor,  insisting that he uses it only &quot;as a geologist does the word denudation  - for an agent, expressing the result of several combined actions.&quot;  Since natural selection is power-less without variations, which arise independently  of it, he sometimes wishes he had used the term &quot;natural preservation&quot;;  but by the time the confusion became obvious, the former term was &quot;so  largely used abroad and at home that I doubt whether it could be given  up.&quot; In addition to this negative reason for retaining the term, Darwin  has positive reasons as well: natural selection is analogous to artificial  selection not only in its dependence on variations, but also in the impressiveness  of its results. Natural selection solves the problem of how organisms become  adapted to the conditions of life, &quot;as artifical selection solves  the adaptation of domestic races for man's use.&quot; Furthermore, the  former is more efficient than the latter: a domestic breeder &quot;scarcely  selects except external and visible characters, and secondly, he selects  for his own good; whereas under nature, charac-ters of all kinds are selected  exclusively for each creature's own good.&quot; Darwin can thus see &quot;no  limit to the perfection of the coadaptations which could be effected by  Natural Selection.&quot; It is still the case, however, that &quot;natural  selection means only the preservation of varia-tions which independently  arise.&quot;33</P>  <P>In what senses, then, could natural selection be said to produce designed  results? One twentieth-century study of Darwin's own views on the subject  concludes that there are at least three such senses: natural selection  (1) will always produce adaptation of the organism to its environment,  (2) will never produce in an organism structures that are harmful to it,  and (3) will never produce structures in one organism solely for the benefit  of another. Since these can legitimate-ly be regarded as &quot;purposes,&quot;  it would be incorrect to say that Darwin considers natural selection totally  purposeless. On the other hand, natural selection <I>does </I>seem to exclude  the claim that specific organs or organic forms are designed. According  to Darwin, not even organs of sight or the order of primates, much less  the human eye or the human species, could be considered designed results  of natural selection.34</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Therefore, Darwin concluded that &quot;there seems to be no more design  in the variability of organic beings, and in the action of natural selection,  than in the course which the winds blow.&quot;35 This does not mean, however,  that Darwin is willing to attribute every aspect of evolution to chance.  He repeatedly affirmed his &quot;inward conviction&quot; that &quot;the  Universe is not the result of chance.&quot; Although he distrusted this  conviction, since he believed that the human mind is descended from the  minds of lower animals, he appeared to be genuinely persuaded of &quot;the  extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of con-ceiving this immense  and wonderful universe&quot; as &quot;the result of blind chance or necessity.&quot;  This put him in &quot;a simple muddle; I cannot look at the universe as  the result of blind chance, yet I can see no evidence of beneficent design,  or indeed of design of any kind, in the details.&quot; Although he feared  that the issue may ultimately be incomprehen-sible, he is &quot;inclined  to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details,  whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.&quot;36</P>  <P>This last statement is probably the best summary of Darwin's mature  position on design. Although it is likely that he never resolved the question  of ultimate purpose to his own satisfaction, he at least believed that  his theory does not exclude all design: someone could embrace Darwinism  and yet consistently maintain that natural laws, including the laws of  variation and natural selection, are designed. According to Darwin's own  understanding of the theory, however, specific details are due to chance,  not merely in the sense that their causes are unknown but in the sense  that they are really accidental. Neither of the two major elements in the  theory can be plausibly interpreted as directed: not variation, because  it is predominantly useless or harmful; and not natural selection, because  its only func-tion is to insure that the few survivors of the struggle  for life will be better able to withstand the next round. If evolution  is really due to these two factors, then the particular forms taken by  organisms, species, genera, and orders are accidental. Therefore, Darwin's  ver-sion of Darwinism excludes the possibility that any specific form of  life is designed. In particular, it implies that human beings, as the latest  products of an inherently directionless process, must be regarded as undesigned.</P>  <P>Note that this issue here is not methodological agnosticism with regard  to design, but a complete exclusion of designed results. The former, it  seems, is a necessary characteristic of all scientific theories, and in  that sense such theories might be called &quot;ateleological.&quot; Darwin's  theory, however, (at least according to his interpretation of it) takes  a further step and might properly be called &quot;anti-teleologi-cal.&quot;  To illustrate: Newton's laws of motion ignore the issue of design, but  they may be used to produce designed results; given a complete knowledge  of initial conditions, the result can be predicted. Darwin's theory, however,  precludes any determinate outcome of evolution. In particular, Darwinism  excludes design in human beings.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>Thus there is a fundamental conflict between Darwin's theory and the  Christian theological tradition. The conflict is not between Christianity  and evolution, and has nothing to do with natural theology. For the Christian  theologians surveyed here, a basic consequence of Christian belief in God  is the belief that the human species was designed by God. Darwin denies  the latter, and thus logically denies the former as well.</P>  <P>There are, of course, people who disagree, and who regard Chris-tianity  and Darwinism as perfectly compatible with each other. The two cannot be  regarded as compatible, however, unless the former is taken to mean something  other than what the mainstream theological tradition through the Protestant  Reformation has meant by Chris-tianity, or the latter is taken to mean  something other than what Charles Darwin meant by Darwinism.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER><B>REFERENCES</B></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE=-1>1.

of Christians in Politics</CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">With another presidential election fast approaching,
secularists are once again fanning the flames of fear against politically
conservative Christians. &quot;I can&iacute;t remember a time when the danger
to civil liberties and fundamental constitutional rights was more extreme
or more pervasive than it is today,&quot; writes Ira Glasser, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Glasser goes on to accuse
the Christian Coalition of seeking &quot;to amend the Constitution to put
religious indoctrination back into the public schools.&quot; Other secularists
routinely condemn Christians for seeking to legislate their religious beliefs
into law.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">There is a valid point lurking somewhere in this undeniably
overblown rhetoric. Like most religions, Christianity has been employed
on occasion as an engine of intolerance as some sought to propagate its
doctrines by law. However, Christianity also has been one the most powerful
defenders of freedom in the history of the world. Between these paradoxical
extremes lie the peril and the promise of Christians in politics today.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nathaniel Hawthorne aptly captured this peril and
promise in his stories about the American Puritans. Repelled by the Puritans&iacute;
religious intolerance, Hawthorne admired their realism and their unswerving
devotion to principle. The latter trait he lucidly depicted in his short
story &igrave;The Gray Champion&icirc; (1835), where a first-generation
Puritan mysteriously returns to Boston in 1689 to thwart the subjugation
of the colonies by King James II. Like a fiery Old Testament prophet, the
old Puritan  --the &quot;Gray Champion&quot; of the story's title-- denounces
the usurpations of Royal Governor Sir Edmund Andros and urges the people
to resistance. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In this story Hawthorne showed how the same rigid
idealism that spawned the Puritans&iacute; religious bigotry also produced
a powerful commitment to moral principle that made them resist political
tyranny. Hence the paradox of Christianity: its religious intolerance may
subvert republican government, but its rigorous attachment to moral principle
may be necessary to defend it.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">One of the greatest achievements of American constitutionalism
was the manner in which it resolved this paradox by harnessing the moral
idealism of Christianity while restraining its potential for bigotry. America's
Founders harnesssed Christianity&iacute;s moral idealism by stressing the
importance of morality in civic life and by acknowledging the crucial role
churches played in fostering that morality. Indeed, several Founders argued
that ministers had the responsibility to speak up about moral problems pressing
society. In the words of John Adams, &quot;It is the duty of the clergy
to accommodate their discourses to the times, to preach against such sins
as are most prevalent, and recommend such virtues as are most wanted.&quot;
At the same time, the Founders sought to temper Christianity's intolerance
by removing theological questions from the political arena, which greatly
reduced the consequences of religious intolerance by ensuring that state
power would never be used to resolve theological controversies. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The Founders' arrangement produced an institutional
separation between church and state even while forging a practical tie between
religion and politics on the basis of morality. Christians were discouraged
by the nature of the regime from using the government to promote their theological
beliefs; but the door was left open for them to enter the political arena
as citizens in order to promote government policies in accord with both
the principles of the Constitution and the &igrave;&quot;laws of nature
and nature&quot;s God&quot; on which those principles are premised. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The political activities of Christians in the new
nation reflected the Founders&iacute; understanding of the role of religion
in society. Many Protestant evangelicals opposed state funding of churches
because they thought it corrupted religion, and gradually even the congregationalists
who supported establishments of religion changed their minds. When Christians
did become involved in politics in the early nation, they generally sought
to do so on the basis of principles of civic morality that were held in
common by both reason and revelation. In the years before the Civil War
they entered the political arena by the thousands to spearhead crusades
against duelling, lotteries, war, poverty, prostitution, alcoholism, and
slavery. These political activities on behalf of secular concerns proved
that evangelicals could fulfill a vital political function by serving as
the political conscience of the nation.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in the
controversy over Cherokee removal from Georgia. Federal treaties had guaranteed
the Cherokees their lands upon the condition that they become both peaceful
and &quot;civilized.&quot; The Cherokees kept their part of the bargain.
They embraced agriculture, became educated, adopted Christianity, and pursued
republican self-government. The Georgians, however, had no intention of
respecting Cherokee treaty rights, and in 1828 and 1829 the Georgia legislature
tried to legislate the Cherokee Nation out of existence, extending its laws
over Cherokee lands and demanding that the federal government remove the
recalcitrant Indians. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The evangelical missionaries who had been working
among the Indians rose to the Cherokees' defense, led by the corresponding
secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, Jeremiah
Evarts. Evarts, a lawyer, helped turn the removal issue into a major national
controversy. Under the nom de plume &quot;William Penn,&quot; he wrote twenty-six
essays defending the Cherokees for the <I>National Intelligencer</I>. The
essays were a tour de force of logic, morality, and law. Evarts and other
evangelicals based their arguments against removal not simply on Biblical
morality, but on the natural right of property, the inviolability of contracts,
and the God-given equality of all men proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence,
which they argued applied to Indians as well as white men. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">Unfortunately, both Congress and the President rebuffed
evangelicals' efforts on behalf of the Cherokees, and the government eventually
relocated the Indians further West in a scandalous episode of American history
known as the Trail of Tears. The controversy nevertheless demonstrated that
Christians could fulfill the role that the Founders had created for them:
they could put their idealism to constructive use by intervening in politics
on the basis of principles of natural justice rather than doctrines of sectarian
theology.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">In responding to the modern secularists who attack
them, Christians today ought to learn from their predecessors in the early
nineteenth century. Contrary to the rhetoric of Patrick Buchanan, the battle
over public morality need not be a &quot;religious war.&quot; Public policy
ought to be based on public principles, and modern Christians can make this
clear by appealing to the same &quot;laws of nature and nature's God&quot;
that their forebears invoked in the public arena more than a century ago.
By articulating anew the moral common ground shared by all human beings,
contemporary Christians can silence the claim that legislating morality
is the same as legislating theology and assure their place as equal participants
in the public debate.</FONT> <BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier">When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in United States
in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were<I> &quot;forever forming associations</I>.&quot;
Tocqueville found especially noteworthy the myriad of civic associations
that Americans organized for moral and educational purposes. Instead of
looking to the government for help, publicly-spirited citizens sought to
solve societal problems on their own.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">What Tocqueville may not have realized was that this
national enthusiasm for association was of recent vintage. Although Americans
had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations
did not occur until the second decade of the nineteenth century. And perhaps
no one was more important in bringing it about than Lyman Beecher. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet
Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, Lyman Beecher
was a towering preacher and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues
commented after his death, &quot;in massive talent Lyman Beecher stood among
his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate alone.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">As a young minister in the early 1800s, Beecher faced
a disintegrating society. Church attendance was down, and alcoholism and
other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox
Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. In the political
sphere, elected officials were increasingly reticent about enforcing either
morality or piety by law, and there was growing political support for abolishing
tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism
in New England.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like
most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could
not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry
depended on religion. Now that state support for religion was collapsing,
he feared the worst. But instead of giving into despair, he came up with
a brilliant response: If the government could no longer be relied on to
support religion and morality, he announced, religious adherents themselves
had to do what the government could not.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling
people to &quot;support the gospel and attend the public worship of God,&quot;
Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. &quot;But these means
of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute
but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable
contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians,
and by all classes of the community who love their country.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher advocated replacing government support for
religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread
the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute.
In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations
would seek to create a public consensus through educational efforts because
in a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Following Beecher&Igrave;s lead, evangelicals soon
organized scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and
for social and political reform. They formed groups to help end poverty,
to teach reading and writing to the poor, and to prevent the abuse of alcohol.
Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American
Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of
the sabbath. This multitude of private associations transformed American
society in a way that few government programs ever could. By the time of
the 1830s, it was a well developed system of voluntary activity and benevolence.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">They say ministers have lost their influence,&quot;
Beecher wrote years later. &quot;The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary
efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence
than ever they could&quot; have by state support. He had learned through
experience that the free enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile
to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish.
Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and
Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state
as beneficial to true religion. But they tended to view religion as a private
matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher&Igrave;s unique contribution
was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once state
support of churches had ended.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Interestingly, even as Beecher championed Christianity&Igrave;s
civic role, he had a keen appreciation for the limits of religious activism.
Unlike many later reformers, he had a firm belief in human sinfulness, and
he harbored no illusions that human beings could create an earthly paradise.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">Beecher further recognized the dangers that political
activism posed for Christianity. Political ambitions could easily overwhelm
the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher subsequently advised Christians
to restrict their political efforts to the &quot;great questions of national
morality&quot; instead of trying to formulate an explicitly Christian position
on every conceivable political issue. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">&quot;When great questions of national morality are
about to be decided,&Oacute; he wrote, &Iuml;such as the declaration of
war; or, as in England, the abolition of the slave trade&Ouml; it becomes
Christians to lift up their voice, and exert their united influence. But,
with the annual detail of secular policy, it does not become Christians
to intermeddle, beyond the unobtrusive influence of their silent suffrage.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier">During our own era when questions are again being raised
about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might benefit
from Beecher&Igrave;s free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion
in public life. <BR>

The year was 1951, and England was embroiled in a bitter general election
campaign. Six years earlier the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill
had been thrown out of power. Now the same party, still led by the same
indomitable Churchill, was attempting a comeback. The conventional wisdom
was that the attempt would fail. The conventional wisdom was wrong. Voters
went to the polls on October 25, and the next morning the whole world knew
that the the Conservative Party had recaptured control of Parliament and
Churchill had regained the post of Prime Minister. <BR>
<BR>
Within a few weeks of the change of power, Churchill's office sent a letter
to C. S. Lewis, inviting him to receive the honorary title &quot;Commander
of the British Empire.&quot; One can only guess what Lewis thought when
he first read the letter, but one suspects that he appreciated it, for he
greatly admired Churchill.<SUP>1 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Despite his admiration, however, Lewis declined the proposed honor. He wrote
back to Churchill's secretary that he was grateful for the recognition,
but he worried about the political repercussions: &quot;There are always&#133;
knaves who say, and fools who believe, that my religious writings are all
covert anti--Leftist propaganda, and my appearance in the Honours List wd.
of course strengthen their hands. It is therefore better that I shd. not
appear there.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP> The letter is characteristic of Lewis, for
it shows how diligently he tried to steer clear of partisan entanglements.
He was never a party hack like John Milton; he never founded a political
movement like G.K. Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc; he even shunned giving
money to political causes. Prior to World War II, one of Lewis's students
informed him of his work on behalf of the Communist--backed loyalists in
the Spanish Civil War. Lewis quickly told the student that he had a rule
about not donating money &quot;to anything that had a directly political
implication.&quot;<SUP>3</SUP> After the War, Lewis continued to keep his
distance from politics. According to stepson David Gresham, Lewis was skeptical
of politicians and not really interested in current events.<SUP>4</SUP>
Lewis's own writings seem to bear this out. His wry poem &quot;Lines During
a General Election&quot; presents the following rather bleak assessment
of politicians: &quot;Their threats are terrible enough, but we could bear/
All that; it is their promises that bring despair.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP> And
as far as caring about the &quot;great issues&quot; of his day, Lewis wrote
his brother in 1940: &quot;Lord! how I loathe great issues&#133;'Dynamic'
I think is one of the words invented by this age which sums up what it likes
and I abominate. Could one start a Stagnation Party--which at General Elections
would boast that during its term of office no event of the least importance
had taken place?&quot;<SUP>6</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Paradoxically, none of this means that Lewis never said anything important
about politics. In fact, he said a great deal--more than most people probably
realize. It is startling to note just how many political topics Lewis broached
in his writings: crime, obscenity, capital punishment, conscription, communism,
fascism, socialism, war, vivisection, the welfare state, the atomic bomb.<SUP>7</SUP>
When Lewis talked about these matters, however, it was not in the way most
politicians do. He was wholly unconcerned with what political scientists
today like to call &quot;public policy&quot;--that conglomeration of compromise,
convention, and self--interest that forms the staple of much of our own
political diet. If you expect to find a prescription for solving air pollution
or advice on how to win an election, don't bother reading Lewis. He has
nothing to tell you. His concern was not policy but principle; political
problems of the day were interesting to him only insofar as they involved
matters that endured. Looked at in this light, Lewis's penchant for writing
about politics and his simultaneous detachment from the political arena
seem perfectly explicable. It is precisely because Lewis was so uninterested
in ordinary political affairs that he has so much to tell us about politics
in the broad sense of the term. By avoiding the partisan strife of his own
time, he was able to articulate enduring political standards for all time.
<BR>
<BR>
Nowhere is this clearer than in Lewis's writings on tyranny and morality.
<BR>
<BR>
Fascism and communism were the two most obvious manifestations of tyranny
about which Lewis wrote, but they were far from the only kinds of tyranny
about which he was concerned.<SUP>8</SUP> Tyranny comes in many forms, most
of which are more subtle than Stalin's gulag or Hitler's death camps. Lewis
knew this, and his most compelling writings on tyranny for us today focus
on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular, Lewis was concerned
about the tyranny that could result from the union of modern science and
the modern state. <BR>
<BR>
To understand the dangers of a scientific state, one must first understand
something about modern science. <BR>
<BR>
Modern science is premised on the notion that all things are determined
by material causes. It proposes strict laws that explain natural phenomena
in terms of physical, environmental or hereditary necessities--e.g., the
ball falls when dropped because of the law of gravity; the dog salivates
at the sound of the bell because of environmental conditioning; the mosquito
generates other mosquitoes because of its genetic code. Now no matter how
necessary such materialistic determinism may be in the study of the natural
world, it cannot be applied indiscriminately to humans without destroying
the very possibility of knowledge and virtue. Such determinism destroys
the possibility of knowledge, according to Lewis, because it undermines
the validity of human reasoning;<SUP>9</SUP> it destroys the possibility
of virtue because it denies the free choice upon which all virtue depends.
<BR>
<BR>
If modern science is correct that human thought and conduct are functions
of non--rational causes, then the nature of politics changes fundamentally.
Under the old order, politics involved serious reflection about justice
and the common good. But the more man thinks he is determined by non--rational
causes, the less important serious reflection becomes. Under the new order,
all that matters is achieving the end result. The only deliberation is among
social science bureaucrats, and the only question is not &quot;What is just?&quot;
but &quot;What works?&quot; Moreover, since the new order has dispensed
with the notion of man as a moral agent, &quot;what works&quot; will almost
inevitably be intrusive. As long as man was regarded as accountable for
his actions, there were certain limits beyond which the state was not supposed
to tread. Laws promulgated under the old system promised punishment, but
they could not compel obedience. This is because the very idea of punishment
presupposes free choice: One can only be punished after one has done something
meriting punishment. If a person is willing to face the consequences of
his actions, he can still break the law. His ability to choose is left intact.
<BR>
<BR>
If people act because of environmental and biological necessities, however,
the government no longer need deal with them as free moral agents. Under
the new system, preemption replaces punishment as the preferred method of
social control. Instead of punishing you for making the wrong choice, the
state simply eliminates your choice. So instead of laws telling us to wear
seat--belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
our car seats. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes
are automatically deducted from our paychecks. <BR>
<BR>
In this brave new world, the relationship between citizen and state begins
to resemble the relationship between master and slave, as Lewis pointed
out so perceptively in his essay, &quot;Willing Slaves of the Welfare State.&quot;
The cardinal difficulty with this type of scientific paternalism is that
it undercuts that which makes us human; in the name of saving man from his
problems, it abolishes man: &quot;The question&#133; has become&#133; whether
we can discover any way of submitting to the worldwide paternalism of a
technocracy without losing all personal privacy and independence. Is there
any possibility of getting the super Welfare State's honey and avoiding
the sting? Let us make no mistake about the sting. The Swedish sadness is
only a foretaste. To live his life in his own way, to call his house his
castle, to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, to educate his children as
his conscience directs, to save for their prosperity after his death--these
are wishes deeply ingrained in &#133; civilised man.&quot;<SUP>10<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis's most haunting portrait of this kind of despotism came in his <I>novel
That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>11</SUP> There the spirit of modern social
science becomes incarnate in the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments--NICE,
for short. Of course, there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists
are exactly the type of bureaucratic manipulators that Lewis attacked in
nonfiction works like <I>The Abolition of Man</I>.<SUP>12<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
At this point one can anticipate several objections: First, isn't Lewis
being unfair to science by implying that it inevitably leads to tyranny?
And isn't he being unfair to scientists by implying that all they want is
power to enslave others? And don't many modern problems--from air pollution
to congestion on our freeways--require technological solutions that can
be provided only by scientific experts?<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of such objections and replied that he wasn't against science
or scientists per se and that of course he did not think that science would
necessarily lead to tyranny of the sort depicted in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I><SUP>13</SUP>
One might be tempted to conclude from this that Lewis's objection to science
was narrow--that all he really opposed was the abuse of science. But such
a conclusion would be misleading. For when Lewis said he wasn't attacking
&quot;science&quot; or &quot;scientists&quot; he seems to have had a very
specific meaning in mind. He was not attacking science insofar as it was
the quest for greater knowledge; he was attacking it insofar it was a quest
for power--in particular, for power over man. In practice this meant that
while Lewis accepted the legitimacy of natural science he rejected much
of the social sciences. Learning about chemistry or biology was acceptable,
if not honorable; trying to use chemical or biological maxims to understand
the nature of man was not. A glimpse of this view can be found in the character
of William Hingest in <I>That Hideous Strength.</I> Hingest is Lewis's prototype
for the &quot;good scientist,&quot; a brilliant and crusty physical chemist
who thinks more highly of his family tree than of his scientific prowess.<SUP>14</SUP>
Hingest is interested in science for the sake of knowledge rather than power,
and he takes a dim view of those who want to use science to control man.<SUP>15</SUP>
Indeed, he does not regard as science at all those disciplines that try
to use the scientific approach to analyze man. When Mark Studdock talks
to him about &quot;sciences like Sociology,&quot; Hingest coldly replies:
&quot;There <I>are</I> no sciences like Sociology.&quot;<SUP>16</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As for the objection that we must rely on the advice of scientists, because
only they have the answers to today's complicated problems, Lewis could
not agree. Lewis does not dispute that scientists have plenty of knowledge;
the problem is that most of it is irrelevant. Political problems are preeminently
moral problems, and scientists are not equipped to function as moralists.
Said Lewis: &quot;I dread specialists in power because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man's opinion no added value.&quot;<SUP>17 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
The cardinal danger of depending on science for political solutions, then,
is that science is divorced from those permanent principles of morality
upon which all just political solutions depend. Indeed, words like &quot;justice,&quot;
&quot;virtue,&quot; &quot;mercy&quot; and &quot;duty,&quot; are terms without
meaning within the scientific framework. And so while science is not necessarily
tyrannical, it can easily become a tool for tyrants because it has no firm
grounding in morality. The same goes for politics: Without a firm grounding
in a firm morality, politics easily slides into tyranny. <BR>
<BR>
But if morality is what we need, how do we go about achieving it? Lewis's
answer to this query is far more controversial than one might suppose. <BR>
<BR>
Many Christians today argue that morality must be founded upon the Bible.
The extent to which this belief holds sway can be seen in the catchwords
Christians use when they become involved in politics; most argue for a return
to &quot;Biblical values,&quot; &quot;Christian values,&quot; &quot;transcendent
religious truths,&quot; or (to use the dominant phrase) &quot;traditional
values&quot; based on the &quot;Judeo--Christian tradition.&quot; The terms
differ slightly, but the bottom--line remains the same: The only real source
of morality is Christian revelation.<SUP>18<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis was aware of this view, but rejected it. As he wrote in his posthumously
published essay on ethics: <BR>
<BR>
It is often asserted&#133; that the world must return to Christian ethics
in order to preserve civilization&#133; Though I am myself a Christian,
and even a dogmatic Christian untinged with Modernist reservations and committed
to supernaturalism in its full rigour, I find myself quite unable to take
my place beside the upholders of &#133;[this] view&#133; <BR>
<BR>
It is far from my intention to deny that we find in Christian ethics a deepening,
an internalization, a few changes of emphasis in the moral code. But only
serious ignorance of Jewish and Pagan culture would lead anyone to the conclusion
that it is a radically new thing.<SUP>19</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Rejecting the notion of a peculiarly &quot;Christian&quot; morality, Lewis
argued for the existence of a natural moral law known by all through human
reason. This natural moral code cannot be escaped; it is the source from
which all moral judgments come. Its fundamental truths--maxims like good
should be done and evil avoided, that caring for others is a good thing,
that dying for a righteous cause is a noble thing--are known independently
of experience. They are grasped in the same way that we know that 2+2=4.<BR>
<BR>
Lewis was certainly not the first to articulate the idea of natural law.
As any good medievalist could tell you, &quot;It's all in Aquinas.&quot;
It is also in Paul, Augustine, Cicero, Grotius, Blackstone, and the Declaration
of Independence. But this idea of natural law is precisely what many Christians
reject, even those who cite Lewis. Unintended ironies often result. In an
essay on &quot;Law and Nature&quot; written by one prominent evangelical,
for example, extensive favorable citations of Lewis's Abolition of Man appear
on one page, while this denunciation of natural law appears on another:
&quot;Even if man can treat the so--called natural laws as absolutes for
society and government, the consequence is cruelty to man. Without the reference
point in the Bible, there is no basis to judge which laws of nature are
applicable to government and man. Depending upon the man or elitist group
in power, many different things can be perpetrated and be justified on the
basis of natural law.&quot;<SUP>20<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis regarded this point of view as the cobelligerent of modern philosophy.
For just as modern philosophy attacked the ability of reason to know an
objective moral law, this sort of Christianity considered reason to be too
corrupted by sin to know objective morality apart from the Bible. Lewis
found this belief disheartening, as he wrote his brother: &quot;Did you
fondly believe --I did--that where you got among Christians, there at least
you would escape from the horrible ferocity and grimness of modern thought?
Not a bit of it. I blundered into it all, imagining that I was the upholder
of the old, stern doctrines against modern quasi--Christian slush; only
to find that my sternness was their slush&#133;. They all talk like Covenanters
or Old Testament prophets. They don't think human reason or human conscience
of any value at all&#133;.&quot;<SUP>21 <BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
As far as I know, Lewis never directly addressed the political difficulties
of this rejection of natural law by Christians; yet these difficulties must
be understood in order to fully grasp the importance of Lewis's natural
law teaching for us today. <BR>
<BR>
The problem with tying all morality to the Bible is that it implies that
those who don't believe in the Bible cannot really be good citizens. After
all, if only believers can have access to true morality through the Bible,
perhaps only they can be trusted to make the laws. What has been called
the theological--political problem resurfaces with a vengeance, for in this
situation there exists no common ground on which believers and non--believers
can meet for debate and joint action in the political arena. The natural
law rescues us from this quagmire by articulating a morality shared by believer
and unbeliever alike. <BR>
<BR>
This is not to say that the only justification for natural law is political.
The overarching reason for Christians to believe in natural law is because
it is demanded by revelation itself. Lewis knew this with full force, but
before examining his comments we would do well to refer to the Apostle Paul.
In chapter two of Romans, Paul argues that &quot;when Gentiles&#133; do
by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even
though they do not have the law, since they show that the requirements of
the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness,
and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot;<SUP>22</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Now according to Paul, the Gentiles have a knowledge of morality even without
having Old Testament revelation. They do that which is right &quot;by nature.&quot;
That &quot;by nature&quot; does not mean &quot;by instinct&quot; here is
clear from the context, for Paul goes on to describe the process by which
the Gentiles come to moral knowledge &quot;by nature&quot;--and the process
is a rational one. It consists of the inner mental dialogue of the conscience
with &quot;thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.&quot; Nor does
Paul diminish the rationality of this knowledge by the phrase &quot;written
on [or 'in'] their hearts.&quot; As Lewis argued in <I>The Discarded Image,</I>
Paul's statement here is in complete harmony with the ancient view that
morality is dictated by &quot;right reason&quot;--and more particularly,
with the Stoic conception of natural law: &quot;The Stoics believed in a
Natural Law which all rational men, in virtue of their rationality, saw
to be binding on them. St. Paul['s]&#133; statement in Romans (ii 14 sq.)
that there is a law 'written in the hearts' even of Gentiles who do not
know 'the law' is in full conformity with the Stoic conception, and would
for centuries be so understood. Nor, during those centuries, would the word
hearts have had merely emotional associations. The Hebrew word which St.
Paul represents by kardia would be more nearly translated 'Mind'.&quot;<SUP>23</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Though Romans 2:14--15 is the single explicit reference in the New Testament
to natural law theory, its importance should not be minimized on that account.
For it is the context in which this reference to natural law appears that
shows us its true importance, not the absence of other references to natural
law in the Bible. In the immediate context of the passage, Paul is trying
to explain how a just God can condemn wicked Gentiles who have not had the
benefit of the Mosaic law. Paul argues that the Gentiles have &quot;no excuse&quot;
because they themselves recognize the substance of the moral law by nature.
In other words, the natural law allows God to justly condemn wicked Gentiles.
<BR>
<BR>
In the broader context of Pauline theology, the necessity of a natural law
becomes even more evident once one focuses on the proper function of Old
Testament law. Paul emphasized that Old Testament law was worthless as a
method to save people from their sins because no one could ever hope to
perfectly fulfill it. All the Old Testament law did was to make the Jews
conscious of sin so that they would know that they needed a savior; the
law demonstrated their need for repentance before God.<SUP>24</SUP> But
Christ died to save Gentiles as well as Jews. Because God never promulgated
the moral law to them through revelation, Gentiles must have been conscious
of their sin through some other route, or they never would have known of
their need to repent. This &quot;other route&quot; is natural law. Without
it, the Gentiles could not repent and be saved.<BR>
<BR>
Viewed in this way, it does not matter that Romans is the only place where
Paul explicitly delineates the natural law for the Gentiles, because the
need for a natural law is presupposed by the very preaching of the gospel
of repentance to anyone who is not a Jew. As Lewis noted in his essay on
ethics: &quot;The convert accept[s]&#133; forgiveness of sins. But of sins
against what Law? Some new law promulgated by the Christians? But that is
nonsensical. It would be the mockery of a tyrant to forgive a man for doing
what had never been forbidden until the very moment at which the forgiveness
was announced&#133;Essentially, Christianity is not the promulgation of
a moral discovery. It is addressed only to penitents, only to those who
admit their disobedience to the known moral law.&quot;<SUP>25<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Lewis made this same argument somewhat more fully in <I>The Problem of Pain</I>.<SUP>26</SUP>
<BR>
<BR>
Lest one think that I am overstating the case for natural law, let me present
a caveat: Natural law provides a basis for Christians to enter politics,
but it does not provide simple--minded solutions to specific political problems.
Nor did Lewis claim that it would--nor for that matter has any other thinker
within the natural law tradition. As Lewis more than once explained (echoing
Aristotle's <I>Ethics</I>): &quot;[M]oral decisions do not admit of mathematical
certainty.&quot;<SUP>27</SUP> Natural law only supplies general moral precepts;
prudence is required to correctly apply those precepts in particular situations.
Hence there is always the chance that one's political decision will be wrong.<SUP>28<BR>
</SUP> <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to those Christians who reject natural law, however, this problem
of uncertainty cannot be solved by replacing the law of nature with the
law of revelation as expressed in the Bible. The Bible rarely gives particular
advice on specific political issues. It does not tell us whether to build
nuclear missiles or invade Panama; it does not inform us what type of social
programs to enact, if any; it does not guide us in our choice of the best
tax system. The Bible invariably requires interpretation if it is to be
used as a political guidebook, and interpretation opens the door for misconstruction.
The Bible is infallible; but its interpreters are not. So the Bible can
be abused and misused as much as natural law. <BR>
<BR>
Now I am not arguing--and I know Lewis would not argue--that the Bible has
no role in the area of morality. But in a society that is not a theocracy
the Bible can never be the only standard of morality. The Christians who
lived during the American Founding recognized this fact, and their political
rhetoric was fashioned accordingly. They spoke regularly of the &quot;Laws
of Nature and Nature's God&quot; and of acting in accord with both &quot;reason
and revelation.&quot; They saw natural law as the necessary meeting point
for citizens of all religious beliefs.<SUP>29</SUP> Like the early American
Christians, Lewis recognized the inescapable need for natural law. Christians
today would do well to heed his advice.<BR>

in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious
of sin.&quot; [Romans 3: 19--20, NIV] Paul implicitly seems to include the
natural law in his discussion here. For he says that the law speaks to &quot;those
under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held
accountable to God.&quot; But the &quot;whole world&quot; obviously includes
the Gentiles as well as the Jews; and the only &quot;law &quot; they know

</H4>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">D</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">URING the summer of
1932, Oxford don C. S. Lewis traveled to Ireland to vacation at the home
of childhood friend Arthur Greeves. Lewis had grand plans of writing an
allegory during his stay that would explain the intellectual journey leading
to his religious conversion.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">1 </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Thirty-three
years old, Lewis had converted to Christianity less than two years earlier,
and he was eager to share his newfound faith with the world. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis initially had tried to tell his story in verse.
He struggled with the poem for several months before giving up on it as
a failure, which is perhaps just as well. Lewis&iacute;s first two books&oacute;both
poetry&oacute;had been commercial flops (his last volume had sold only 126
copies in the first three months after publication).</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">2</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Now Lewis decided to start his allegory afresh by writing it in prose. Lewis
eventually titled his work <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and as the
title suggests, the work consciously echoed Bunyan&iacute;s <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s
Progress.</I> In fact, Lewis later described his own allegory as &quot;Bunyan
up to date.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Like the pilgrim Christian in Bunyan's tale, the pilgrim
in Lewis's story also seeks the celestial city. He just does not realize
that fact for most of the book. In the process of seeking personal fulfillment,
he stumbles into all kinds of intellectual, spiritual, and moral errors.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis wanted his story to satirize the false ideologies
and &quot;isms&quot; then rampant in western culture, especially the ideology
of materialism.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">4</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The reigning philosophy of twentieth century science and culture, materialism
decreed that everything--animals, human beings, moral beliefs, even reason
itself--could be explained as the result of purely physical processes and
properties. The roots of materialism reached back into into aniquity, but
the fearsome modern strain was born less than a century-and-a-half ago with
the writings of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche
and others.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">5</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Darwin was crucial, because he offered a scientific framework that promised
to explain morality and even reason as the product of purely natural processes.
He didn't really succeed in his grand design, but he set the research agenda
for those who came after him. Marx, in fact, wanted to dedicate <I>Das Kapital</I>
to Darwin, though Darwin declined the honor.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">6</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Ideas have consequences, and materialism's consequences
for western culture were particularly extensive and particularly poisonous
-- as the world was finding out even while Lewis started to write his book.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ORE than a thousand
miles away from where Lewis was on vacation, an old man stood weeping at
a train station. Desperately clutching his large sack filled with bread,
he pleaded with the station-master to let him on the train.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;You can go on the next train,&quot; the official
told the man, &quot;but not your bundle. Law is law--no bread can be transported
without a license.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;But how can I return to the village with empy hands?&quot;
cried the man. &quot;How shall I face the village? They await my return
and their bellies are empty.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">7 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The place was the Ukraine, where an eery emptiness was
settling on the villages and fields as famine spread during the summer of
1932. By the end of the next year, more than 7 million peasants had died
from starvation.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">8</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
This was a disaster made by man, not nature. The deaths were the result
of Joseph Stalin&iacute;s policy to subjugate the Ukrainian peasants and
force them into government-run collectives. Even while the peasants starved,
the Soviet government placed huge quantities of grain in domestic reserves
and exported an additional 800,000 tons of grain to other countries.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">9</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
As the famine worsened, villagers were prevented from travelling outside
their villages to seek help, turning the once-bountiful Ukraine into a giant
extermination camp.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The ruthless utopianism exhibited by Stalin was a natural
outgrowth of the materialist understanding of human nature. So were the
policies of the new regime rising in Germany. Even as the Ukrainian famine
reached its peak, German cabinet ministers were enacting sterilization laws
designed to weed out the &igrave;unfit&icirc; among their nation&iacute;s
citizenry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">10</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Within six years, the Nazis would set up killing centers to eliminate the
chronically ill and people with disabilities. It was in these euthanasia
centers that the techniques used to exterminate the Jews were developed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">11<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nor was the United States immune from the corrosive effects
of materialism. In 1932, Americans elected a buoyant new President who declared
in his subsequent inaugural address that &quot;There is nothing to fear
but fear itself.&quot; In the same inaugural speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
asked Congress to grant him extensive new executive powers and warned that
if Congress did not, he would unilaterally take the powers upon himself.
FDR&iacute;s subsequent &igrave;New Deal&icirc; gave hope to millions of
Americans suffering during the Great Depression, but it also layed the foundation
for a mammoth welfare state administered by experts from the social sciences&oacute;experts
who were increasingly dismissive of both moral absolutes and personal responsibility.
The impatience of social scientists with traditional morality could be seen
in the work of anthropologists like Margaret Mead, who had already published
her (now discredited) study of sexual mores in Samoa.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">12</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The denial of personal responsibility among social scientists was perhaps
most notable in the field of criminology. One criminology textbook published
in 1932 baldly stated: &quot;Man is no more 'responsible' for becoming wilful
and committing a crime than the flower for becoming red and fragrant. In
both instances the end products are predetermined by the nature of the protoplasm
and the chance of circumstances.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">13
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's attack on materialism thus came at a critical
juncture in world history. The time was ripe for someone to challenge the
materialist menace. Amazingly, Lewis finished a draft of <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s
Regress</I> by the end of his two-week vacation. It was finally published
in May 1933, the same month Hitler held a midnight bonfire in Germany for
20,000 books that went against the Nazi party line.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">14</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
It is unlikely that Lewis's book was among the books burned, but not because
Hitler would not have found it offensive. The Nazis show up in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;'
Regress</I> as dwarves who are vassals of Mr. Savage, a Nietzschean superman
who sits on a high chair &igrave;dressed in [animal] skins&icirc; and who
wears &igrave;an iron helmet on his head with horns stuck in it.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">15</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
That this was an unflattering portrait of national socialism is undeniable,
but the Nazis first had to know about Lewis&iacute;s book before they could
burn it, and I doubt they even had heard of it. Only 1,500 copies of Lewis&iacute;s
<I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I> had been printed, and alas, even these did
not sell very well. A few weeks after the book&iacute;s publication, Lewis
joked to Arthur Greeves that he expected <I>Pilgrims Regress </I>to be at
least as big a failure as his last book of poetry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">16</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
After three successive flops, Lewis must have wondered about his future
career as a writer.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet he kept writing. Eventually, he even became successful
at it, and he became one of the twentieth century&iacute;s most powerful
and prophetic voices on behalf of cultural sanity. Like Winston Churchill,
who stood alone against the Nazis when many turned a blind eye to their
evil, Lewis was one of a handful of voices in the wilderness to mount a
credible defense against the materialist onslaught during the first half
of our century. The argument he began in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I>
he continued in such books as <I>That Hideous Strength, The Abolition of
Man,</I> and <I>Miracles,</I> as well as in essays such as &quot;Behind
the Scenes,&quot; &quot;The Poison of Subjectivism,&quot; &quot;Bulverism,&quot;
&quot;Transposition,&quot; and &quot;Is Progress Possible? Willing Slaves
of the Welfare State&quot; The observations made in these writings are as
relevant for us today as when they were first written. Hitler and Stalin
may be dead, but the materialist philosophy that gave birth to them and
their regimes is not. Indeed, western society is still in the grip of at
least four of materialism&iacute;s most damning cultural legacies: the rejection
of reason and objective truth, the debunking of objective morality, the
denial of personal responsibility, and the encouragement of coercive utopianism.
Lewis has something to tell us about all four.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The Rejection of Reason and Objective
Truth</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ATERIALISM'S first
deadly legacy is the rejection of reason and objective truth. Nineteenth-century
materialists depicted our thoughts as the irrational products of environment
or heredity or brain chemistry. As a consequence, the intellectual classes
became convinced that only the reality was material, and thus the only true
explanations were reductive. If you wanted to explain a flower, you described
its cell structure, not its beauty. If you wanted to explain human beings,
you looked not to their greatest achievements, but to the raw materials
that made them up. As Leo Strauss put it, modern thought tried to &quot;understand
the higher in terms of the lower: the human in terms of the subhuman, the
rational in terms of the subrational&#133;&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">17
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One possible result of the denial of reason is that people
will become so skeptical that they will believe in nothing. But most people
cannot live without <I>something</I> to give meaning to their lives. Thus,
the ultimate consequence of denying reason is not nihilism but a leap into
irrationality. The philosopher Nietzsche foresaw this at the end of the
last century. If objective truth was dead, the only thing that could save
us from the abyss according to Nietzsche was to create our own meaning by
a sheer act of willpower. We <I>will</I> ourselves into believing something
that will give us meaning. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the Nietzschean cosmos, what is prized is not truth,
but creativity, freshness, and power: Whoever is strong enough or creative
enough to impose his vision on other people is the hero. In many respects,
we live in Nietzsche&iacute;s universe. The highest praise of a work of
art or a piece of scholarship in today&iacute;s society is not that it is
true, but that it is &igrave;fresh&icirc; or &igrave;original.&icirc; When
one looks at what passes for scholarship today&oacute;the paradigm approach
in the sciences, deconstruction in literature, and the more extreme forms
of ethnic and gender studies&oacute;it becomes readily apparent that most
scholars have given up even the pretense of seeking objective truth. What
they are concerned about is power&oacute;how long their particular ideology
will control the terms of debate. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The first step to extricating ourselves from this morass
is to understand the fallacies of the materialistic reductionism led to
it, and Lewis can help us do this.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s first sustained attack on reductionism
came in<I> The Pilgrim's Regress. </I>The core of his critique comes in
book three, &quot;Through Darkest Zeitgeistheim,&quot; which literally means
through the darkest abode of the Spirit of the Age. In the book, John&oacute;the
name of Lewis&iacute;s pilgrim&oacute;is arrested by the flunkies of a giant
who symbolizes the materialistic reductionism that was the Spirit of the
Age. John is subsequently jailed, leading to a nightmarish sequence. Lewis
relates that the eyes of the giant had the property of making whatever they
looked on transparent: &quot;Consequently, when John looked around into
the dungeon he retreated from his fellow prisoners in terror, for the place
seemed to be thronged with demons. A woman was seated near him, but he did
not know it was a woman, because, through the face, he saw the skull and
through that the brains and the passages of the nose, and the larynx, and
the saliva moving in the glands and the blood in the veins&#133; And when
he averted his eyes from her they fell on an old man, and this was worse
for the old man had a cancer. And when John sat down and drooped his head,
not to see the horrors, he saw only the working of his own inwards&#133;
and suddenly he fell on his face and thrust his hands into his eyes and
cried out, &euml;It is the black hole&#133; I am mad. I am dead. I am in
hell for ever.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">18 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">John is ultimately rescued from this dungeon by a towering
woman in blue -- Lady Reason, who slays the materialist giant with her sword.
Lady Reason tells John that the giant had deceived him about the real nature
of human beings: </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;He
showed you by a trick what our inwards <I>would</I> look like if they were
visible&#133; But in the real world our inwards are invisible. They are
not colored shapes at all, they are feelings. The warmth in your limbs at
this moment, the sweetness of your breath as you draw it in, the comfort
in your belly because we breakfasted well, and your hunger for the next
meal&oacute;these are the reality; all the sponges and tubes that you saw
in the dungeon are the lie.&icirc;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;But if I cut a man open I should see them in
him,&icirc; replied John.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;A man cut open,&quot; returned the Lady, &igrave;is,
so far, not a man: and if you did not sew him up speedily you would be seeing
not organs, but death. I am not denying that death is ugly: but the giant
made you believe that life is ugly.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">19<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's point was that reductionism really doesn't explain
that which is <I>human</I> at all. In fact, in the name of explaining man,
reductionism explains him away. As Lewis later wrote: &quot;You cannot go
on 'seeing through' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something
is to see something through it&#133; If you see through everything, then
everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible
world. To see through all things is the same as not to see.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">20
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In a wonderful 1956 essay titled &quot;Behind the Scenes,&quot;
Lewis articulated his own view of the proper relation between man and his
material components. He likened life to a stage play. In one sense, nothing
in the play is real. It is all imaginery. It is not really set in the countryside,
the people on stage are not really who they pretend to be. The only realities
are the physical sets and costumes and lighting. The play is &quot;appearance&quot;
and the sets are &quot;reality.&quot; Yet, as Lewis points out, &igrave;in
the theatre of course the play, the appearance, is the thing. All the backstage
realities exist only for its sake and are valuable only in so far as they
promote it.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">21<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis here was calling us back to a teleological view
of the universe of the sort offered by Aristotle. According to Aristotle,
you understand something not by what it came from, but by what it has become.
We understand what an oak trees is not by dissecting an acorn but by examining
a fully grown oak tree. Similarly, we understand human beings by who they
are as an integrated whole, not by trying to break them down into their
material or psychological building blocks. When we do look at the subrational,
we ought to judge it in light of the overall purpose of a whole human being.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The materialist may scoff at this approach, but as Lewis
relished in pointing out, the materialist has his own problems: For the
materialist who debunks everyone else&iacute;s ideas as the subrational
products of their brain chemistry or environment cannot avoid being debunked
himself. If he is honest, says Lewis, the materialist will have to admit
that his <I>own</I> ideas are merely the &igrave;epiphenomenon which accompanies
chemical or electrical events in a cortex which is itself the by-product
of a blind evolutionary process.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">22</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The point Lewis is driving at is that if all thoughts are merely the products
of non-rational causes, this includes the materialist&iacute;s own thoughts.
In other words, there is no reason according to materialism for materialism
itself to be regarded as true.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even people who try to water down their materialism by
granting that reason can be a valid way to truth have a problem, according
to Lewis. For if the universe is how the materialist describes it, it is
not at all likely that reason should have ever developed. &igrave;People
who take [the materialist view],&icirc; explained Lewis, &igrave;think that
matter and space just happen to exist, and always have existed, nobody knows
why; and that the matter, behaving in certain fixed ways, has just happened,
by sort of a fluke, to produce creatures like ourselves who are able to
think. By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce
the planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for
life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so
some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series
of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">23</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In sum, materialists have no ground to stand on if they
deny the reality of reason outright, and very little ground to stand on
if they claim to accept reason in part.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">Objective Morality</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">C</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">LOSELY related to
materialism's attack on reason is its debunking of objective morality, which
is its second sorry legacy. Materialists early in our century denied the
existence of objective standards binding on all cultures, claiming that
environment dictated our moral beliefs. Such relativism was uncritically
adopted by much of the social sciences, and it still undergirds much of
modern economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. In the words
of a college sociology text popular in the 1980s, &igrave;We must recognize
that judgments about good and bad, moral and immoral, depend very much on
who is doing the judging; there is no universal standard to appeal to.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">24
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The triumph of moral relativism has been particularly
evident in our colleges and universities, many of which are populated by
social scientists who berate us for our rampaging &quot;ethnocentrism,&quot;
our unmitigated arrogance in believing that our &quot;values&icirc; might
somehow be &quot;right.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Gone is the old undergraduate curriculum with its heaping
doses of the Bible, of Plutarch's <I>Lives</I> and Aristotle&iacute;s <I>Ethics;</I>
in its place is an unrelenting parade of the horrors culled from the cultures
of barbarians. Students used to study the great moments in the history of
Western civilization; now they learn about the cannibalism of tribes in
South America, or the sexual proclivities of some obscure race in the South
Pacific. The point of such lessons, of course, is to &igrave;broaden&icirc;
students&iacute; horizons sufficiently so that they will no longer believe
that their &igrave;values&icirc; are sacrosanct. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Exposed to this message for four years, even the most
sturdy students are apt to become infected. And those who do not succumb
from the disease will likely find themselves incapacitated. I recall having
breakfast with a friend who was about to obtain a degree in one of the social
sciences from a large secular university. Our discussion was wide ranging,
but when the subject of morality came up she became curiously bewildered.
Taught for years that moral beliefs are a function of culture and personal
predilections, she maintained that there were no objective grounds to justify
moral judgments against other cultures. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;What about the Nazis?&quot; I asked.&quot;Surely
we have an objective basis to condemn what <I>they</I> did?&quot; She thought
a moment, looked more bewildered than ever, and then answered to the effect
that she was personally revolted by what the Nazis did&oacute;but she could
still find no objective basis for her revulsion.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis attacked moral relativism in his opening chapters
of <I>Mere Christianity,</I> where he pointed out that all people&oacute;even
criminals&oacute;appeal to a universal standard when trying to excuse their
own behavior. And even those who claim that right and wrong are mere conventions
will hotly protest when someone wrongs them! Lewis&iacute;s line of argument
here is similar to that presented by Augustine in his <I>Expositions on
the Book of Psalms</I>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">25</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
However, Lewis&iacute;s most sustained assault on moral relativism comes
not in <I>Mere Christianity</I> but in <I>The Abolition of Man, </I>a small
incisive volume based on lectures he delivered at the University of Durham
in the early 1940s. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In <I>Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis pointed out that we
cannot escape making moral judgments. Every action presupposes a goal toward
which the actor acts, and the goal (no matter how clinically it is expressed)
represents a judgment of value. We cannot exist without making moral judgments,
argued Lewis. The only question is what those judgments will be. Speaking
within the western natural law tradition, Lewis proposed that at the foundation
of all moral judgments is one set of ethical first principles shared by
all human beings. These first principles include obligations to treat other
people justly and to keep one&iacute;s promises. It from these first principles
that all other moral judgments and ethical systems are derived. Strictly
speaking, these first principles cannot be demonstrated themselves, for
they are the first principles from which everything else is demonstrated.
One recognizes them in the same way that one intuitively knows that 2+2=4,
or that if a=b, and b=c, then a=c. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But what about the social scientists&iacute; claim that
different cultures have had radically different moral codes? In the face
of these differences, how can Lewis maintain that human beings have access
to a moral common ground? Lewis responds with typical candor in an essay
titled &igrave;The Poison of Subjectivism&icirc;:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">The answer [to the claim that cultures radically
differ on their moral codes] is that this is a lie&oacute;a good, solid,
resounding lie. If a man will go into a library and spend a few days with
the <I>Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</I> he will soon discover the
massive unanimity of the practical reason in man. From the Babylonian <I>Hymn
to Samos,</I> from the Laws of Manu, the <I>Book of the Dead,</I> the Analects,
the Stoics, the Platonists, from Austrialism aborigines&#133; he will collect
the same triumphantly monotonous denunciations of oppression, murder, treachery,
and falsehood, the same injunctions of kindness to the aged, the young,
and the weak, of almsgiving and impartiality and honesty&#133; There are,
of course, differences. There are even blindnesses in particular cultures&oacute;just
as there are savages who cannot count up to twenty. But the pretence that
we are presented with a mere chaos&oacute;though no outline of universally
accepted value shows through&oacute;is simply false&#133;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">26
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Those who want to explore this topic further can read
the appendix to <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> where Lewis has helpfully compiled
many of the common moral maxims held across cultures and across history.

<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The denial of personal responsibility
</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">I</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">F materialism has
been hard on reason and morality, it has been equally destructive of personal
responsibility, which is its third poisonous legacy. By claiming that human
thoughts and actions are dictated by our biology and environment, materialism
undermined personal responsibility. The results can be seen in our criminal
justice system, our civil justice system, and even our welfare system. Ever
since sin entered the world, human beings have sought excuses for their
behavior, but materialism handed us an inexhaustible supply of excuses.
No matter what we do, it can be attributed to a cause other than our own
choices: our social environment, our subconscious drives, our brain chemistry.
An article a few years ago titled &igrave;Roots of Crime&icirc; told about
a researcher who was testing juvenile delinquents&iacute; hair in order
to prove that their violent behavior was the result of vitamin deficiencies.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">27</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
In this new scheme of things, even Hitler can be excused for his crimes,
for in the words of one historian, he &igrave;was a prisoner of his pathological
unconscious drives.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">28 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Against this modern ethic that no one is responsible,
Lewis strove to make people aware of just how responsible they really are.
Lewis&iacute;s defense of personal responsibility was undergirded by his
commitment to Christianity. The Christian gospel proclaims salvation only
to those who recognize themselves as guilty people in need of divine forgiveness.
But materialism offers modern man a whole slew of methods to avoid facing
our guilt. If nothing is our fault, then what is there to be guilty about?
Lewis countered this mentality not so much by direct disputation, but by
trying to place a miror in front of us that would cause us to recognize
the evil in our own souls. This is most apparent in his fictional works,
where there are key moments of self-revelation when major characters realize
that they are really to blame for the fix they are in.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the novel <I>That Hideous Strength</I>, Mark Studdock
is a young sociologist who has spent his life cravenly currying favor with
others in order to promote himself. When he subsequently finds himself in
the middle of a totalitarian conspiracy, he first wonders what bad luck
put him there. &igrave;Why had he such a rotten heredity?&icirc; he whined
to himself. &igrave;Why had his education been so ineffective? Why was the
system of society so irrational? Why was his luck so bad?&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">29</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Finally hitting bottom, he suddenly sees with brutal clarity who he really
is and how his own choices led him to the mess he was in. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One cannot read Lewis&iacute;s fiction without being
convicted of the fact that we are more accountable than we would like to
think. Lewis calls us to responsibility by reminding us that every action
has a consequence, and that no wrong choice&oacute;however small&oacute;is
insignificant. As Uncle Screwtape tells his demon nephew Wormwood in <I>The
Screwtape Letters</I>: &igrave;The safest road to Hell is the gradual one&oacute;the
gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones,
without signposts.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">30<BR>

<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The proliferation of coercive
utopianism</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">T</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">HE fourth legacy
of materialism is coercive utopianism. Although the belief that all thought
and behavior are predetermined by material causes would seem to deny the
power of human beings to reshape their world, materialism in fact inspired
a fierce strain of coercive utopianism. Claiming either that they were merely
the servants of the forces of materialism&oacute;or with Nietzsche, that
they could overcome materialism by a sheer act of will&oacute;materialist
reformers tried to create secular utopias in Russia and Germany. In America,
meanwhile, significant parts of the cultural elite began to believe that
we could engineer the perfect society through social science and planning.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The coercive utopians in Germany and Russia were both
targets of Lewis&iacute;s scorn. Unlike many intellectuals of his time who
hated one form of totalitarianism only to embraced another, Lewis abhorred
both facism and communism as the poisonous fruit of the same evil tree.
Both ideologies were totalitarian; both led to the deaths of innocent millions;
and so both were to be regarded with equal contempt.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">31</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But fascism and communism were far from the only forms
of coercive utopianism about which Lewis was concerned. Tyranny comes in
many forms, most of which are more subtle than Stalin&iacute;s gulag or
Hitler&iacute;s death camps. Lewis knew this, and his most compelling writings
for us today focus on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular,
Lewis feared that the modern welfare state would become ever more intrusive
as government planners allied themselves with the tools of materialist social
science.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If people act because of environmental and biological
necessities, as the materialists claim, the government no longer need deal
with them as free moral agents. Under the new system, preemption replaces
punishment as the preferred method of social control. Instead of punishing
you for making the wrong choice (which was the traditional method), the
state simply eliminates your choice. Instead of laws telling us to wear
seat-belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
the car seat. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes are
automatically deducted from our paychecks. Instead of holding us responsible
for the correct use of any number of helpful&oacute;but potentially hazardous&oacute;products,
the government simply prevents those products from reaching the market.
In the hands of the social planners, the nation is their laboratory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s painted a grim portrait of this kind of
despotism in his novel <I>That Hideous Strength. </I>There the spirit of
modern social science becomes incarnate in something called the National
Institute for Coordinated Experiments&oacute;NICE, for short. Of course,
there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists are exactly the
type of technocrats that Lewis feared. In the name of science and humanity,
they claimed the right to remake society without bothering to obtain society&iacute;s
consent&oacute;let alone the consent of the individuals involved.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">While we are a long way off from the nightmare vision
depicted by Lewis in <I>That Hideous Strength,</I> we certainly should be
able to understand some of what he&iacute;s getting at. For public policy
decisions in our country are increasingly made precisely by the type of
unelected experts that Lewis talked about. During the past three decades
our legislators have transferred much of their authority to a vast array
of independent regulatory agencies staffed by unelected experts who are
largely unaccountable to average citizens. Environmental policy is a good
example. Decisions about how&oacute;and whether&oacute;to save certain endangered
species are made not by elected officials, but by government biologists
and bureaucrats. Decisions about whether we can have fires in our fireplaces
are made not by elected officials but by professional bureaucrats specializing
in air quality. Now some of these decisions we may well applaud; some we
may not. But the fact remains that we&oacute;and those we elect&oacute;have
very little to say in the matter. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But, you may ask, what&iacute;s wrong with that? Surely
it is better for experts to make decisions about these things than the average
voter or politician? After all, don&iacute;t today&iacute;s increasingly
complicated problems demand that we hand over the reins of power to the
experts?<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis didn&iacute;t think so. He did not dispute that
technocrats have plenty of knowledge; this knowledge may even be necessary
for good public policy. But it is not <I>sufficient</I> for good public
policy. Political problems are preeminently moral problems, according to
Lewis, and technocrats are not equipped to function as moralists. &igrave;I
dread specialists in power,&icirc; he said, &igrave;because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man&iacute;s opinion no added value.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">32<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ORE than five decades
after the publication of <I>That Hideous Strength, </I>more than six decades
after the publication of <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and more than
thirty years after C. S. Lewis&iacute;s death, we still live in the shadow
of what George Gilder calls &igrave;the materialist superstition.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">33</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Lewis was a prophet, but it takes more than a prophet to make a revolution.
Yet a prophet can prepare the way for a revolution, and Lewis helped do
that.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">At the end of <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis called
for a new natural philosophy that would understand human beings as they
really are, not try to reduce them to automatons or guinea pigs. &quot;When
it explained,&quot; said Lewis, &quot;it would not explain away. When it
spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the <I>It</I>
it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the <I>Thou.</I>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">34
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis was not quite sure what he was asking for, and
-- being a realist -- he certainly was not convinced that the revolution
would actually come about. Yet during the next decade it just might. We
live during an era of tremendous and tumultuous change, and nowhere is the
tumult more evident than in the sciences. Recent developments in biology,
physics, and cognitive science are raising serious doubts about the most
fundamental assumptions of materialism. In biology, scientists are discovering
such irreducible complexity in biological systems that the only reasonable
explanation seems to be a non-material designer. In physics, our understanding
of matter is becoming increasingly non-material. In cognitive science, efforts
to reduce mind to the physical processes of the brain have failed repeatedly.
Even in social sciences such as psychology researchers are beginning to
question their materialist assumptions and rebuild their disciplines on
foundations more conducive to human dignity and personal responsibility.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">35
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In other words, for perhaps the first time since the
materialist onslaught we have an opportunity to bring about the collapse
of materialism and to re-found the sciences along the lines envisioned by
C. S. Lewis more than half-a-century ago. For the sake of cultural sanity
--and survival -- let us hope that we succeed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>in the Film &quot;Shadowlands&quot; </CENTER>

<P>It is understandable why the film<I> Shadowlands</I> (now available on
videotape) won rave reviews from almost everybody. The acting is splendid,
the script is literate, and the production design is first-rate. All things
considered, the film is a wonderful piece of cinema and well worth seeing.
For those of us who never had the rare privilege of meeting C. S. Lewis
in person, <I>Shadowlands</I> brings Lewis and his world to life in a new
way.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, despite its beauty and its pathos, <I>Shadowlands</I> is not
without major failings in the realm of accuracy. Unfortunately, many people
seem to take at face value the film's opening claim that &quot;this is a
true story.&quot; The reviewer for <I>Christianity Today</I>, for instance,
wrote that although &quot;the filmmakers have taken some liberties with
facts&#133;and simplified some of Lewis&iacute;s complex musings&#133; the
film is generally true to Lewis's life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As a matter of fact, it isn't. The names of the principal characters are
the same, but much of the plot has been contrived to fit the point of view
of scriptwriter William Nicholson.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not complaining about the numerous small inaccuracies. I expected those.
After all, it doesn't really matter that Joy had two sons instead of one
(though it might matter if you were the son who was left out). Nor does
it really matter that the marriage between Joy and Jack went on a lot longer
than the film indicates (more than three years in reality). Such errors
are minor and certainly fall within the domain of legitimate dramatic license.
<BR>
<BR>
What is more difficult to accept are the two huge errors on which the whole
plot seems to hinge.<BR>
<BR>
The first of these errors is the depiction of Lewis's life before he met
Joy. The film portrays Lewis as leading a cloistered existence in which
he avoided women, children, and --above all-- commitments to any relationship
or situation that offered him the potential for risk or pain. This depiction
of Lewis is a convenient way to set up him up for the film's subsequent
love story. But the portrayal invents a C. S. Lewis who never existed. <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the storyline of the film, Lewis had lived a life that was anything
but cloistered or free from pain or commitment. During World War I, the
supposedly cloistered Lewis served in the trenches in France, where he was
wounded in action. After the war, the supposedly sexless Lewis apparently
became infatuated with Mrs. Moore, a widow old enough to be his mother.
When the affair ended and Lewis became a Christian, Lewis the uncommitted
somehow felt obliged to support Mrs. Moore for the rest of her life, and
she lived with Lewis and his brother until she had to be moved to a rest
home (where he visited her every day). Meanwhile, the Lewis who did not
associate with children had three children come and stay with him during
World War II (they had been sent out of London because of the air raids
(just like Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy in the <I>Lion, the Witch, and
the Wardrobe</I>). Similarly, the Lewis who supposedly avoided women also
developed a close friendship with English poetess Ruth Pitter; he even told
a friend that were he the kind of man to get married, he would marry her!
And the Lewis who walked through life without painful experiences had to
deal with his rejection by Oxford's academic community, which never saw
fit to select this brilliant scholar for a professorship (Cambridge finally
did in the 1950s). <BR>
<BR>
The second huge error of the film is its suggestion that Lewis's faith in
God was undermined by Joy's death. While the film shows grief-torn Lewis
saying (quite tentatively) to his stepson that he still believes in heaven,
there is little indication in the film that Lewis still believes in a loving
God. Indeed, in an outburst before his friends, Lewis is shown railing at
the brutality of a God who acts as cosmic vivisectionist. Although this
scene is invented (Lewis&iacute;s grief was intensely private), the speech
against God that William Nicholson puts in Lewis's mouth is actually inspired
from a passage in Lewis's <I>A Grief Observed.</I> The problem is that Nicholson
is slipshod in the thoughts he chooses to lift from Lewis: He appropriates
Lewis's struggles from <I>A Grief Observed</I> but doesn't bother to give
any sense of the reaffirmation of faith found in the rest of that book --
or in the many other letters, interviews, and articles by Lewis during the
rest of his life. It seems that Mr. Nicholson wasn't interested in portraying
an orthodox Christian who experienced intense grief and yet maintained both
his faith and his intellect. <BR>
<BR>
Here is where the pernicious aspect of <I>Shadowlands</I> becomes evident.
Lewis's writings -- including his intimate confessions in <I>A Grief Observed</I>
--were largely efforts to vindicate God's often unfathomable ways to man.
Lewis sought to remove the obstacles that separate us from a living relationship
with the One who truly loves us. <I>Shadowlands</I> does precisely the opposite
by setting up Lewis's faith as a straw man and then proceeding to knock
it down. <BR>
<BR>
The film repeatedly shows Lewis delivering a simplistic speech about how
God uses painful experiences to make us listen to Him. The facile confidence
with which Lewis delivers the speech is gradually contrasted with personal
hell he goes through during Joy's sickness and eventual death. By the end
of the film, Lewis has presumably recognized that his simplistic theological
dogmas won't wash. He doesn't find God in suffering; he finds a silent void.
Thus is the most cogent defender of Christian orthodoxy of the twentieth
century transformed into a modern champion of anguished doubt.<BR>
<BR>
I tend to think that most people who view <I>Shadowlands</I> will overlook
the underlying contempt the film displays for Lewis's faith because Lewis
is portrayed so sympathetically. And make no mistake: Despite the biographical
inaccuracies mentioned above, Lewis <I>is</I> portrayed sympathetically.
This film is not anti-Lewis. But perhaps that is because the villain in
this story is not Lewis, but God. <BR>
<BR>
The great irony of <I>Shadowlands </I>is that it even as it draws people
closer to Lewis, it may drive them further away from the One in whom Lewis
found the meaning of life. What a tragedy it would be if those who see the
film come away thinking that Lewis's earlier faith was somehow refuted by
reality. Mind you, I am not claiming that this <I>will</I> be the result
of <I>Shadowlands</I>. One can only speculate about the effect of the film
on individual viewers, and this sort of speculation is rather dubious anyway.
I can only suggest that given the film's script that some viewers may conclude
that Lewis's defense of Christianity could not stand the scrutiny of real
life. <BR>
<BR>
There is another possibility, of course: The film may inspire those who
see it to read Lewis's writings for themselves and discover the reality
of the faith to which he pointed. I hope that this second possibility will
turn out to be the reality.

<H1><CENTER>Proprietary Rights: Privilege and Confidentiality In Cyberspace</CENTER>

<P>At the recent Internet Law Symposium 95, sponsored by the Seattle-based
Discovery Institute, noted technology author and pundit George Gilder stated
that &quot;[i]n the twenty-first century, all law will be Internet law.&quot;
The proof of this statement is the debate already taking place among lawyers,
scholars, technologists, and Netizens about security, privilege, and confidentiality
in cyberspace. It is common currency in the popular press that nothing is
secure or private on the Internet. Whether true or not, whether an exagger-
ation or understatement, these sentiments breed doubt that any attomey-client
privilege can be maintained in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the law is not as muddled as conventional punditry suggests.
That is not to say that there are not real business risks associated with
use of digital communications today, just as there are risks associated
with use of fax machines, voice mail, and ordinary &quot;snail&quot; mail
(physical mail), but privilege waiver probably is not one of them. To understand
the issue, we do not start with the rules of professional conduct on maintaining
the confidences and secrets of clientsl or with the technology or medium
of exchange. Rather, we look to criminal law. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Title 18 prohibits the interception of any aural, wire, or electronic communications
by any person. It also prohibits the use or disclosure of unlawfully intercepted
communications. Electronic communications mean any transfer of signs, signals,
writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted
in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo-electronic,
or photo-optical system. Wire communications mean any aural transfer (i.e.,
transfer containing a human voice) made in whole or in part through wire,
cable, or other like connection between the point of origin or point of
receptions Thus, for example, cellular phone communications, though wireless
in origin, are wire communications because they connect to land lines to
complete the call. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short, no one can lawfully intercept communications made over phone lines
or wireless communications. The same is true for information or communications
made over the Internet, including e-mail. For the uninitiated, it may seem
surprising that the Wiretap Act is the source of prohibition for interceptions
on the Internet. But the fact is that the Net is a series of interconnected
networks of computers connected by and accessed through the telecommunications
infrastructure--that is, the phone lines and exchanges throughout the world
connect the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To intercept an Internet communication (limited voice communications are
now available in addition to e-mail) requires a wiretap. Thus, there is
no greater insecurity when the Internet communication is in transit over
the phone lines than there is with an ordinary phone call.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The greater concern arises once the communication is passed through computers
on the network or when it is stored electronically. Internet communications
may pass through dozens of computers on the way to the fmal receiver. Each
computer is a potential source of exposure. Communications stored electronically
in a computer share the same vulnerability as voice-mail and other data
fides.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hacking or &quot;cracking&quot; networks has become easier today, in part
due to the Internet. Hackers routinely exchange information over the Net
about systems' vulnerabilities. Any network connected to the Internet has
the potential to be cracked absent security measures.<BR>
Congress recognized the vulnerability of networks and amended the Wiretap
Act in 1986 to address the problem, enacting the Electronic Communication
Privacy Act (ECPA). ECPA makes it unlawful to access without authorization
a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided.
It is also unlawful to exceed an authorization to access a facility and
thereby alter, obtain, or prevent authorized access to a wire or electronic
communication while it is an electronic storage. In other words, hacking
is illegal, just as altering or obtaining stored data without proper authority
is. In short, it is unlawful to intercept an e-mail at point from transmission,
while in transit, when stored or after receipt.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If new technologies are to succeed, users must have confidence in the security
of the system. Making hacking and eavesdropping felonies goes a long way
to achieving that goal, but mere prohibitions on interception of communications
do not preserve privilege. Congress did, however, provide the answer. Section
2517(4) of Title 18 provides that &quot;[n]o otherwise privileged wire,
oral, or electronic communication intercepted in accordance with, or in
violation of, the provisions of this chapter shall lose its privileged character.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, interception of communications over the Internet or over the phone
should not result in waiver of the attomey-client privilege. There is no
similar provision (and none is needed) for electronically stored data, however,
because there is no waiver of privilege when a thief steals a document out
of a file cabinet, and likewise no waiver when the file is in digital form
and the breakin occurs through the phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Some have argued that any communication &quot;readily capable of interception&quot;
should not be protected if, indeed, it is intercepted. The Association of
the Bar of the City of New York has admonished its members to , exercise
caution when engaging in conversations containing client confidences by
cellular or cordless phones readily capable of interception and [to] consider
taking steps such as encryption or scrambling of signals sufficient to ensure
the security of such conversations &quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rulings as to cordless phones are correct. Inadvertent interceptions
have occurred frequently with cordI ss phones, which transmit on a normal
FM frequency within radio range. Using a cordless phone is like operating
a radio station and broadcasting your message. Anyone within range could
receive the communication. Thus, it would not be uncommon to hear a conversation
on an FM car radio or even a baby monitor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same is not true for cellular phones, however. While they use part of
the spectrum for transmission, they do not transmit within a range or frequency
capable of inadvertent interception by commercial users of the airwaves
or listeners. Rather, scanners are required to intercept cellular communications
and that is an illegal act. From a privilege standpoint, this is the difference
between using the PA system to deliver your message in a crowded shopping
mall and whispering a secret in a private room. California has amended its
evidence code to make clear that attomey-client communications do not lose
their privilege character when conducted by cellular phone. This is the
right approach and is timely because wireless data exchange is becoming
more costeffective every day, so wireless e-mail and other packetswitched
data services by wireless means are not far off.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We can look at the problem another way-from the user's expectations. The
same people who argue that the Internet or cellular phones are too insecure
to use without encryption would be aghast at the suggestion that the government
should be free to eavesdrop on those same calls or communications. Yet the
rule is that if a citizen has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the
communication, then there is no &quot;search&quot; under the Fourth Amendment.
Congress, here again, has answered the question (and the Association of
the Bar of the City of New York as well) by making clear that essentially
any communication carried over a communication system provided by a telecommunications
carrier is deemed to be not &quot;readily accessible to the general public.&quot;
In other words, the person making the communication has a reasonable expectation
of privacy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed ' there is no question but that the government needs a court order
or warrant based on probable cause that a felony is being conunitted to
conduct electronic surveillances To obtain the contents of communications
in electronic storage for less than 180 days, the government also must obtain
a warrant based on probable cause. If the communications have been stored
for over 180 days, a warrant is still necessary unless the government gives
advance notice to the user. With notice, the government can use other legal
process such as a subpoena to obtain the contents, but then the user can
always challenge the process and move to quash. The same procedures apply
to communications stored in remote computing services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Wiretap Act and ECPA are the statutory floor; states may enact more,
but not less, strict laws. These laws reflect society's view that citizens
have every right to expect their private connnunications to be free from
unwarranted intrusion, whether such communications be by wire, electronic
means, or by old-fashioned voiceto-voice over a desk in a lawyer's office.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But shouldn't the attorney and client use encryption out of prudence? (Encryption
is an electronic lockand-key technology based on algorithms that makes messages
and stored data unreadable to anyone except the sender and intended recipient.)
Encryption presents a host of policy challenges that have yet to be resolved.
Strong encryption is banned from export as a &quot;munition.&quot; There
are questions about who should have access to the keys. Some nations, such
as France, ban encryption entirely. Yet some form of encryption may become
the foundation of electronic commerce, not because of privilege or the need
to maintain it, but because of the need for a secure payment systems. (Criminals
also enjoy the idea of ubiquitous and strong encryption as a means of thwarting
legitimate law enforcement surveillance.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the degree of privacy necessary for communications should be
a business decision, not one based on fear of losing the privilege umbrella
for the entire transaction. Nor should the decision to use encryption be
based on fear that someone could otherwise use readily available and easily
modified technology to unlawfully intercept the communication. If that were
the criteria, all business would have to be conducted under the &quot;cone
of silence&quot; and cellular phones would be as rare as Maxwell Smart's
shoe phone. <BR>

<P>Much hype and misinformation has been churned out about cyberspace and
the information highway. While the mass media's coverage of this new medium
does not rival that of the O.J. trial, attention being paid to users and
providers of computer networks and online services has grown intense during
the past two years. Culminating this misinformation glut is legislation
in Washington, D.C.: Senator Exon's Decency Act of 1995. <BR>
<BR>
The Exon Bill represents leadership that is uninformed of the citizenry
it is attempting to rule over, reminiscent of the British style of &quot;taxation
without representation&quot; legislation during America's frontier days.
Despite the stories of security problems and the wilderness of data, the
electronic communities that comprise the Net are in most cases stable and
self-regulating as their citizens hold each other and their system administrator
accountable for their online content and conduct. <BR>
<BR>
In an era when government is trying to downsize so that it may live within
its means, an attempt at regulating a medium residing within and beyond
the jurisdiction of the terrestrial courts and agencies of the U.S. is shortsighted
and embarrassing. Specifically, many electronic communities whose computer
and databases reside physically in the U.S. have users (i.e., online citizens)
who reside in the U.S. and in other countries. Despite differences in culture
and legal standards, individuals meet and share information on a regular
basis. <BR>
<BR>
Such users can meet peaceably because they adhere to what is generally known
as an acceptable use policy (AUP), or netiquette, or terms of service. Ranging
from an informal understanding of what is proper to a structured code and
signed contracts, users agree with an electronic community's system administrator
to abide by rules in order to participate in that particular community.
By letting their contracts be their conscience, users have much liberty
and responsibility as they act and speak in cyberspace. While there are
rogue and raucous electronic communities out there, there are thousands
of communities that have gotten along fine over the years because their
users care about what goes on while online. Users turn misusers in to system
administrators (a.k.a., &quot;sysops&quot;) and in cases where the violative
conduct touches upon a terrestrial law, the sysop turns the offender over
to the appropriate authorities (e.g., the recent incident of child pornographers
being turned in by America Online's chief sysop and CEO Steve Case). <BR>
<BR>
While Senator Exon's Bill is well intentioned -- laws that argue to protect
children will always be deemed to be a &quot;good thing&quot; -- it is unnecessary
for the most part. If, however, there needs to be regulation of the Internet,
then such rule making should come from an authority other than an elected
representative who is not even a user of e-mail. Instead, a more appropriate
body for the consideration and recommendation of laws for the online world
is one that does not yet exist formally but one whose time has come: an
&quot;Internet Law Task Force&quot; or ILTF. Analogous to the Internet Engineering
Task Force or IETF, a volunteer body that meets regularly to discuss and
determine what technical standards should be agreed upon in furtherance
of the interoperability of the various networks that make up the Internet,
an ILTF could be a body of lawyers and technical experts from the U.S. and
other countries whose mission would be to support the positive use of the
Net. Already, many individual professionals here and abroad work together
on issues of mutual interest because they enjoy it and because they deem
it as a necessity. <BR>
<BR>
An ILTF could be called upon by elected representatives in Washington, D.C.,
and elsewhere for expert testimony and for fact finding missions. However,
an ILTF would be in the best position to hear and understand the interests
of online citizens and sysops. Also, an autonomous and volunteer ILTF would
appreciate the fact that users and sysops of individual electronic communities
do not wish to have their rules subverted by an outsider. <BR>
<BR>
In the absence of an ILTF, legislation like Senator Exon's will most likely
result in the Balkanization of cyberspace, chilling participation and openness,
increasing costs through heightened liability (thus decreasing access for
the poor), and dividing the medium on jurisdictional boundaries -- dividing
lines wholly inconsistent and incompatible with the meaning and working
mechanism of the fluid and global medium that is the Net. Data will be driven
offshore to computer networks in other countries, connectivity will be cut
short, and electronic commerce will blossom elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
Even if content providers on the Net were to voluntarily submit to a government
requirement for a rating system similar to the motion picture industry (re:
How About X Ratings On the Internet? by G. Griggs, 29 March 1995, The New
York Times, A14), implementation of adequate software in support of such
online notification symbols and protocols would take years. Also, and perhaps
more importantly, such a measure ignores the same fact that the Exon Bill
does: the Net is a global phenomenon. Attempts to control information here
will simply mean that such information will be stored elsewhere and accessible
remotely from the U.S.. The interconnected nature of the Net permits users
to route around barriers and get to the information they want. <BR>
<BR>
Recently in these Op-Ed pages it was written that :&quot;The successful
marketspace will be one that makes shopping a transaction not just involving
goods and services but also experience. It will not forsake community for
commerce.&quot; (Steven Alburty, It's a Buyer's Marketspace, The New York
Times, A15, 20 March 1995.) Similarly, successful governance should not
forsake communities and their rules falsely in the name of children. <BR>

<PRE>

<B>NETIZENS</B> - the community of Internet users - bear a strong resemblance to Americans of the 
Wild West.  They are fiercely independent, value their privacy and have a strong distrust of laws 
made in Washington, D.C. Nonetheless, even the Wild West was tamed as the rule of law replaced 
frontier Justice.


The Internet already is home to some 40 million users and growing exponentially as networks 
join networks.  With a &quot;point and click,&quot; data and opinions move over the world.  In such a wired 
world, bringing law to the Internet will not be easy.  In fact, it will not be possible at all if nations 
act unilaterally, piecemealing the Internet into jurisdictions with conflicting laws and liabilities.  We 
need what some have called a <B><I>Magna Carta for the Information Age</I></B>.


First, it must be understood that anything as massive as the Internet cannot be &quot;regulated&quot; in any 
meaningful manner.  It was designed to be a self-healing network of diverse platforms capable of 
operating under the most adverse of conditions - nuclear holocaust.  The Internet evolved from 
military use to link the world's leading universities and research facilities together; and ultimately, 
it passed into private hands where its commercial growth has been astonishing.


Today, anyone can set up a &quot;home page&quot; on the World Wide Web and bring ideas to the 
marketplace free of media filters or goverrunent censorship in this or other countries.  In the 
greatest of American traditions, the Internet has unleashed an army of pamphleteers&quot; who are 
'udged, no doubt harshly sometimes, on the merit of their ideas in the marketplace.  Increasingly, 
people also will get news from the Internet, a revolutionary change that will affect politics, culture 
and commerce forever.  In short, the Internet has come too far to be constrained by any one 
government.  For the putative regulator, the message is simple: Law will never keep up with the 
Internet.


For example, China could massacre students in Tiananmen Square but could not &quot;ban&quot; the 
Internet from carrying the news of its infamy.  Now the Chinese government itself is getting into 
the Internet through deals with multinational telecommunications giants.  But if China believes that 
it can control the Internet this way, it may find that the genie is already out of the bottle.  The 
Internet is bigger than China and it crosses all borders free of customs.
Then what is all of the talk about bringing law to Internet? As the Net has become more popular, 
the public - or perhaps more correctly, the politicians - have discovered that there are some dark 
back alleys on the Internet where pornographers and fraudsters lie in wait for the next Internet 
tourist.  But to listen to the politicians and the media outlets, one would think that the Internet was 
dominated by virtual voyeurs, techno-pedophiles and purveyors of electronic smut.  Nothing could 
be further from the truth, as anyone who has visited the popular Louvre or the Smithsonian Web 
sites can attest.


Yet, as the Telecommunications Act of 1995 heads into a conference between the U.S. Senate 
and House, one would think that the only important issue regarding the Internet is regulation of 
pornography.  There is a glaring absence of debate or discussion about the Internet overall, and 
what exists is uninformed.


Some may prefer it that way, but there are a host of important legal issues raised by the Internet 
that should occupy the minds of Congress.  If commerce is to succeed on the Internet, certainty 
and security are prerequisites.  Here there is a need for bringing law to the Internet, and for care in 
doing so.  Too much law may stifle the use of the Net for business purposes; too little law and the 
uncertainty associated with risks and liability of using these new technologies may dissuade some 
that would otherwise embrace such an open network for trade.
If security is to be achieved, we need to come to grips with the use and export of strong 
encryption. (Encryption is a software lock and key that prevents others from viewing or altering 
the content of communications without authorization key.) Recent stories about Netscape 
Communications' encryption standard being cracked in Europe carried the wrong headline.  The 
story should have decried the ban on export of software with stronger encryption, which Netscape 
makes and markets in the United States and which has not been compromised.  Although the fact 
that some U.S. companies are put at a competitive disadvantage in the growing Internet 
applications market is important, there are strong privacy concerns associated with encryption and 
cryptography.


It was only a year ago that the government sought to hold the keys to every encrypted message 
through a required &quot;Clipper Chip.&quot; The firestorm of opposition was great and the idea was 
dropped.  Now the Clinton administration proposes a system of public key encryption where a 
trusted third party would hold the keys to the communication and the government would have 
access only on the same basis as it would for a wiretap.  It remains to be seen whether this 
proposal will meet with the same opposition from Netizens concerned about their privacy in 
cyberspace and the intrusion of government into the Net.


One thing is for sure, however, as the encryption debate progresses: There must be a careful 
balance between legitimate privacy expectations and legitimate law-enforcement requirements.  
Marry strong encryption to a secure network and the first subscriber will be the Cali drug cartel and 
an army of money launderers.  How will the government fight them without the capability to surf 
the Net in pursuit of any criminal? Allow the government too much latitude on the Net and the 
amount of information about our personal lives that can be gathered from monitoring our use of the 
Internet is enormous, raising Big Brotherlike concerns.  The public certainly deserves adequate 
safeguards in the law against government intrusion as well as third-party misuse.


The same balance is needed in coping with credit-card misuse on the Net and by the coming use 
of digital cash.  The rule of law must be to punish the fraudster in the same way, whether his 
medium of exchange is the Internet or a cold call over the telephone.


Indeed, this should be the standard for every aspect of law and regulation related to the Internet.  
Where there is a legitimate regulatory concern - health, safety or welfare - there is room for a law 
that proscribes the offending conduct.  But the resulting law should be medium-neutral; that is, 
fraud should be no more or less illegal because it occurs over the Internet.


We cannot leave it to distant or uninfon-ned politicians to devise the rules of the road, nor can we 
rely exclusively on Internet frontier justice and custom and usage to achieve the certainty business 
demands in today's world of electronic commerce.</PRE>

<H2><CENTER>LIFE AFTER TELEVISION, UPDATED</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>GEORGE GILDER<BR>
<BR>
</I><HR></CENTER>
</H3>
In 1994, four years after I wrote the first edition of Life After Television,
the cornucopian afterlife is indeed at hand. With microchips and fiber optics
eroding the logic of centralized institutions, networks of personal computers
are indeed overthrowing IBM and CBS, NTT and EEC. But as the great pyramids
of the broadcast and industrial eras--the familiar masters of the American
immigration--break apart, new fear and anxieties arise about the future.
If the center cannot hold, what rough beast, shuffling its slow thighs,
slouches toward Hollywood to be born again in gigabytes--and gigadollars--on
the information superhighway?<BR>
<H3><HR>Will life after television mean the dissolution of the American
hearth into a pornucopia of 900-number videos, full-color cold calls from
sultry sisters at Lehman Brothers and real-crime performances in multimedia
by superstar serial killers? Or will the new technologies uplift the culture
and empower the people, as Life After Television predicted?<BR>
<HR></H3>
<BR>
A Hughes Aircraft Corp. rocket's red glare in French Guiana, bombs bursting
in air on 500 channels, give proof through the night that something is going
on out there: 150 choices of DirecTv broadcast satellite images; up to one
billion hertz of cable TV bandwidth; star-spangled malls of infomercials;
CD radio with fidelity beyond the ken of the human ear; high-resolution
wrestlemania; 3,000 films on- demand; interactive personals and impulse
pay-per-view playmates; Yellow Pages blooming into home- shopping bonanzas;
and videogames galore on compact discs and cartridges. All zooming through
the air, blasting through cable and pulsing through fiber at the speed of
light. All to be captured, decrypted, decompressed, rendered and rolled
out from the new set-top boxes, game players and supertheaters in millions
of colors and living rooms.<BR>
<BR>
In such a phantasmagoria, what could be missing? The same thing that is
missing in much of the media coverage of the information superhighway: the
personal computer. What is driving the &quot;telefuture&quot; is not any
convergence of films and TVs, consumer electronics and publishing, computers
and games. What is driving the change is the onrush of computer technology
invading and conquering all these domains. The computer industry is converging
with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged
with the horse, the TV with the nickelodeon, the word processing program
with the typewriter, the computer-aided design program with the drafting
board and digital desktop publishing with the Linotype machine and the letterpress.<BR>
<BR>
The computer industry feeds on the explosive advance of semiconductor and
networking electronics: 1) the law of the microcosm, which shows that microchip
cost-effectiveness rises by the square of the number of transistors crammed
on a single chip, and 2) the law of the telecosm, which shows that computer
cost- effectiveness rises by the square of the number of computers connected
to networks. According to the famous projection of Intel Corp. chairman
Gordon Moore, the number of transistors on a single chip will double every
18 months. According to the record of the last five years, the number of
computers attached to networks is rising too fast to measure. Only by comprehending
the full force of the computer juggernaut can one anticipate the future
of the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Focusing on the technologies alone, however, is not enough, because the
new technologies are often retrofit into failing industries and concepts.
To grasp the telefuture, it is still necessary to see the domonetics of
the technologies--their social and cultural effects and contexts.<BR>
<BR>
The microcosm and telecosm have generated a rich business and domestic culture--a
supporting social fabric of PCs and network users--that not only nurtures,
sustains, applies and expands the technologies but also is enriched and
empowered by them. In positive feedback loops, the customers of the PC culture
are also its creators and protagonists. If you keep your eyes on this culture,
you can anticipate the sources and vectors of growth. If you focus on the
hype of old industries--television and telephony, Hollywood and electronic
games, consumer appliances and other diversionary devices--you will miss
the real action. 
<H3>The Logic Of Technology</H3>
Behind all the changes are the supply-side rhythms of creative destruction.
Radical innovations sweep nearly unnoticed through the economy from obscure
niches such as Woz's garage, Bill Gates' Basic, Bob Metcalfe's ether, Bolt
Beranek &amp;Newman's Internet, Carver Mead's laboratories and Bob Noyce's
workbench. On the heels of these seminal tides come much expensive hype
and hullabaloo from the established industry, which is trying to absorb,
deflect or co-opt the threat. This rhythm of real enterprise and reactive
public relations explains why the telefuture prophesied in Life After Television
rushed in faster than expected, and why the key developments are often downplayed
or misinterpreted today. The publicity is easier to see than the broad tides
of change that have swept through society since 1989.<BR>
<BR>
Take John Malone and Tele-Communications Inc., for example. They are important
not for the new dealmaking spectacles but for decades of enterprise that
have created a new broadband network unique in the world. With links to
63 percent of America's homes--coaxial lines with a capacity some 416,000
times the capacity of telephone twisted-pair wires and easily upgradeable
to two-way communications--the cable industry commands a key resource for
the telefuture.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, as Malone consummated his network, he and TCI were still
discussed by the press chiefly in the idiom of organized crime. Mostly financed
by junk bonds, Cable TV was derived at telecommunications meetings as a
conspiracy of political action committees--&quot;PACs with coax&quot;--foisting
junk services on the American people. Malone and his colleagues appeared
in the pages of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times chiefly in
exposes of corporate chicanery.<BR>
<BR>
By 1993, though, the &quot;cable czar&quot; had reemerged as Dr. Malone,
the reigning genius of America's broadband future. TCI loomed as the spearhead
of a cable industry that had become a unique American resource, putting
the US as much as a decade ahead of Japan and Europe on the information
superhighway.<BR>
<BR>
Even Malone could not keep up with the pell-mell pace of change. In the
early summer of 1992, on a panel at a NewsCorp Conference, he told me, &quot;There
is no short-term need to accelerate the deployment of fiber optics&quot;
in the cable system. The winners would follow a strategy of &quot;step-by-step,
incremental change,&quot; he told the crowd of news executives and Twentieth
Century Fox movie and broadcasting magnates.<BR>
<BR>
But the logic of the technology soon engulfed him. Less than a year later,
on April 12, 1993, Malone publicly committed his company to a $2 billion
investment in fiber--to connect a non-incremental 90 percent of his customers
over the following four years. On October 13, 1993, he sold out, probably
at the top, to Raymond Smith's Bell Atlantic Corp., once a sleepy-time regional
Bell, now an entrepreneurial dervish on the digital highway. &quot;There's
no time to waste in deploying this infrastructure,&quot; Malone then explained.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the great information companies financed by Michael Milken's junk
bonds were still seen as sleazy corpocracies teetering on towers of debt.
By 1993 TCI, McCaw Cellular, MCI, Turner, NewsCorp, Viacom and Time Warner--collective
beneficiaries of $10 billion of Milken funds--had emerged as the titans
of the new information economy and ruled the business pages of the press
or months on end. Scorned in 1989 as part of a Milken scam or &quot;Ponzi
scheme&quot; by Benjamin Stein in Barrons, James B. Stewart in the Wall
Street Journal, Connie Bruck in the New Yorker and other acclaimed reporters
and analysts, TCI and McCaw together attained in 1993 a total market value
of around $50 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In 1989 the most weighty wisdom on the future of media was the &quot;Negroponte
switch&quot;--the theory launched by Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media
Lab that what currently goes by air--chiefly broadcast video--would soon
switch to wires (fiber optic and coax), while what currently goes by wires--chiefly
voice telephony--would massively move to the air.<BR>
<BR>
In Life After Television I urgently touted the Negroponte switch. I still
believe it brilliantly captures the key vectors of change. Shortly afterward,
though, I began to have my doubts that the victory of fiber as a delivery
system would be quite so total as I had imagined. After all, the spectrum
of electromagnetic vibrations is essentially infinite, and several companies,
led by Motorola, were offering wireless local area network (LAN) equipment
operating at Ethernet or Token Ring data rates in the 18-gigahertz band--a
frequency previously used chiefly in outer space. Moreover, BIIC, Photonics
and other firms were offering LANs in the infrared bands of the spectrum--up
in the terahertz and beyond--previously used in the air only by low-data-rate
TV remotes (although infrared pulses were the medium of fiber optics).<BR>
<BR>
By 1994 the vision of scarce spectrum behind the Negroponte switch was in
a rout. Qualcomm Corp. of San Diego introduced a cellular technology that
allowed use of the entire spectrum in every cell (rather than permitting
frequency reuse only once every seven cells as in current cellular technology).
By creating smaller cells in larger numbers, it would be possible to multiply
spectrum almost without limit while drastically lowering handset power usage.
Spectrum once too scarce to waste on video was becoming as cheap and abundant
in the air as in wires, where fiber optics had already opened an era of
potential bandwidth abundance. Andrew Grove, CEO of Intel, memorably declared:
&quot;You think computer prices are plummeting. Wait till you see what happens
to bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Still, there remained limits to the use of higher frequencies for communication.
Higher frequencies, it was believed, created prohibitive problems of interference
and power. Rain, for example, would drown out microwave communications.
Pigeons would fry on the antennas. Then Cellular Vision of New York Inc.
overthrew this conventional wisdom. It announced in the fall of 1992 that
it was broadcasting 49 channels of studio-quality video in the 28-gigahertz
band of the electromagnetic spectrum to 500 homes in the Borough of Queens.
The total cost was some $300 per home. Months later, Gigahertz Equipment
of Phoenix was seeking similar licenses in the West.<BR>
<BR>
Although many observers scoffed at these microwave ventures, on August 4,
1993, Bell Atlantic signed up to market the system through the City of New
York and in neighboring suburbs to the north. US West signed up with Gigahertz
to supply service in its own region.<BR>
<BR>
Shaking most of the certainties of 1980s conventional wisdom, such insurgencies
all stemmed from the still deeper forces of the microcosm and telecosm--described
in Life After Television--that are still gaining momentum in 1994 and will
continue to cascade through the technoscapes of the coming decade. 
<H3>The Avalanche Of Bits</H3>
But with Milken banished from financial markets and Malone in harvest mode,
who will ride the next avalanche of bits on the information superhighway--and
who will be buried under it? Widely regarded as likely winners are Edward
McCracken of Silicon Graphics Inc., the aspiring king of the set-top box
and the video server, and Jim Clark, SGI founder and chairman until February
28 (when he will leave to start his own interactive TV software company).
In the form of 3D graphics hardware and software, SGI's technology is central
to the triumph of computers over television and games. Yet the company's
present strategy is to retrofit these digital engines into the television
set-top boxes and Nintendo game machines of the pre-computer culture. Clark
hopes to provide the content.<BR>
<BR>
SGI offers compelling reasons for this strategy: production volumes and
foundries for the Mips 4000 microprocessor family comparable to those of
the Intel X86 standard; a siphon amid the possible floods of software revenues
to be earned by Nintendo using the SGI architecture; and sales of SGI superservers
to the television programming industry. But in harvesting these benefits
over the next five years, SGI and Clark risk dissipating their energies
by serving the industries of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Is Mickey Schulhof of Sony Corp. going to countervail these trends? He is
trying to converge and digitize all the technologies of the past into a
pi$ata of new consumer appliances, musical hits, videogames and movies,
making blockbuster turkeys such as &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and selling
everything but the feathers and the popcorn. Schulhof grandly plans to rule
both ends of the information superhighway, with Hollywood video and musical
content and a panoply of appliances to play them, from high-definition TV
sets to minidiscs, CDs and videotapes, game players and walkmasters. But
Sony may merely be supplying digital cosmetics to two dying industrial establishments:
Hollywood and consumer electronics. Making an array of incompatible and
incommunicable devices, Sony is defying both the law of the microcosm, which
compels the distribution of intelligence, and the law of the telecosm, which
asserts the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
Lest the information superhighway clog up with wrecked hopes and misbegotten
plans, let us look for the false assumptions behind some of the disappointments
of today.<BR>
<BR>
GTE's Cerritos, Calif., project--the first full test of interactive services,
launched in the mid-1980s-- rolled out its cornucopia of on-demand video,
instant banking, shopping, games and other services to an indifferent marketplace.
Although the results are still shrouded in secrecy, news reports suggested
that people just didn't want to take the trouble. US West and TCI are said
to have made similar discoveries in Denver. If the world lusts for interactivity,
why does it spurn the leading interactive market tests?<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;killer app&quot; for these new broadband systems is supposed to
be pay-per-view television. But, says Frank Biondi, president of Viacom,
&quot;there has been no serious take-up for pay-per-view in 20 years. We
are way behind revenue projections on motion picture pay-per-view.&quot;
When Time Warner raised its pay- per-view movie bandwidth from five to 60
channels in the Borough of Queens, monthly revenue is reported to have risen
by only some $4 per home. &quot;If people really hated going down the block
to pick up a movie, video stores would have a thriving delivery business
today,&quot; commented Michael Noll of the University of Southern California
in the software newsletter Release 1.0.<BR>
<BR>
3DO's new super-Cd-ROM multiplayer and graphics processor may someday find
a market outside Wall Street. But judging from the fall of the company's
stock price, from a high of 48-1/4 when the machine was launched into stores
last October to 26 in mid-January, sales have been disappointing. 3DO indicated
that some 50,000 units had been shipped to retailers, compared with earlier
company projections of &quot;fewer than 100,000&quot; and euphoric expectations
of many more. Similarly, after investment of untold hundreds of millions
of dollars, the Philips CD-I players still lag in the marketplace. If the
world is rushing to multimedia, why is it so slow to embrace the leading
new multimedia players? 
<H3>&quot;Like Feeding Vitamins To A Horse&quot;</H3>
Games show magnate Jon Goodson of Mark Goodson Productions declares that
people don't want to interact with game shows. &quot;It changes the game--for
the worse.&quot; A 1993 Dataquest study reported that people really don't
want to interact with sports events. TV Answer, now Eon, and Interactive
Networks both failed to break through with plans to supply interactivity
to current-day televisions over special radio frequencies allocated for
the purpose by the FCC. Hollywood has determined that audiences have no
interest in shaping the outcomes of films; they want to be surprised. If
people don't want to interact with video, how can the world move beyond
television?<BR>
<BR>
The new standard for digital HDTV, though far ahead of the old analog systems,
will not be officially unveiled until 1995, according to Richard Wiley,
chairman of the FCC's Advisory Committee on Advanced Television. The broadcast
companies that are supposed to adopt it are mostly uninterested. &quot;We
see no way any of us will make money out of this thing,&quot; says John
Swanson, vice-president, engineering, at Cox Broadcasting.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb companies have been
disappointments--Raynet and BroadBand Technologies have had difficulty selling
their equipment. A superb passive optical technology has so far failed to
save BroadBand's stock price. It tumbled from a high of 52 early in 1993,
amid the uproar over the information superhighway, to a low in the mid-20s
by the end of January 1994 as revenue projections were lowered by analysts.
Raychem has pumped more than $100 million into Raynet without yet generating
a profit. Meanwhile, the telephone companies have been dallying with a new
system called Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line, which will let them
send full-motion video down a conventional phone line at six megabits per
second (near to the practical rate of an Ethernet computer network). Although
Eli Noam of the Columbia University Telecommunications Center says ADSL
is &quot;like feeding vitamins to a horse rather than buying a truck,&quot;
the phone companies feel that if they have to compete with TV, it is cheaper
to supercharge the old copper nag for the last few hundred yards.<BR>
<BR>
On the content side the picture is equally cloudy. At multimedia conventions,
television executives declare that there is no way they can make money with
the kind of stuff currently available on CD-ROMs and other such platforms.
During intermissions they mutter off the record that the only way to jump-start
this market is through virtual sex. In the late 1980s the entire Japanese
electronics industry was riding high with the harvest of profits from decades
of investment in consumer electronics. Deciding that &quot;content is king,&quot;
Sony and Matsushita each bought major Hollywood studios. As these companies
moved on toward HDTV, Western pundits prophesied that Japan would dominate
all advanced electronic industries, from semiconductors to supercomputers.
Instead, however, the Japanese electronics industry entered a period of
prolonged decline, suffering heavy financial setbacks and even losing its
lead in semiconductors to American firms. 
<H3>Strategists Focused On Wrong Industry</H3>
From Cerritos to Denver and on to Orlando, Omaha and Castro Valley, from
3DO to CD-I and beyond, from BroadBand to Raynet, from Sony to NEC, the
current and impending disappointments spring from one key mistake. With
some notable exceptions, the leading strategists are focusing on the wrong
industry. You can't get beyond television by collaborating with TV companies
in their long slide to obsolescence. You can't create a new information
infrastructure by propping up the old telephone networks with the right
to provide tv-type services.<BR>
<BR>
The new 3DO and Philips CD-I game machines, for example, both link to interlaced
TV screens that display every other line and then fill in the gaps on a
second sweep. Interlaced screens mean cumbersome text and limited graphics.
Interlaced screens doom multimedia to a fringe videotext fuzz. Yet these
new game players shun the personal computer and its installed base of 33
million home units in order to build up a new installed base from scratch,
connecting to visually inadequate televisions.<BR>
<BR>
Interactivity, almost by definition, is a computer function, not a television
function. Making the boob tube into an interactive hive of theater, museum,
classroom, banking system, shopping center, post office and communicator
is contrary to the nature of the box.<BR>
<BR>
Millions of Americans, however, are eager to turn their personal computers
to these pursuits. Therefore, it is natural that nearly all the relevant
activity is in the computer industry rather than in the television industry.
The PC world provides an environment totally alien to the downside dirges
of consumer electronics.<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker has said, an entrepreneur should always heed the upside
surprises. Upside surprises distract business leaders from a deadening focus
on problems and target them on their opportunities. In the information economy,
the best opportunities stem from the exponential rise in the power of computers
and computer networks, microcosm and telecosm. In the computer industry,
all the surprises tend to come on the upside.<BR>
<BR>
For example, early in 1993 the two leading experts in the field, Bill Gates
of Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel, both boldly predicted total PC sales
between 35 and 40 million, up from a stupendous 32 million in 1992. In an
outcome first predicted in February by semiconductor analyst Daniel Klesken
of Robertson Stephens, the actual number came in at nearly 50 million, between
25 and 40 percent above the forecasts--during what was widely reported as
a down year for computer companies.<BR>
<BR>
This drastic surprise engendered waves of similar upside surprises through
the industry. Despite a chaos of competing architectures and aspiring standards
that meant any particular CD-ROM would most likely not be playable on your
machine, the sales of multimedia-ready computers rose from a few thousand
high-end devices in 1989 to some three-and-a-half million in 1993, bringing
in some $5 billion in revenues. Despite general disappointment in the quality
of the titles, the sales of CD-ROMs soared from a few hundred thousand in
1989 to nearly five million in 1993. As a harbinger of the future, sales
of encyclopedias in CD-ROM format surpassed those of book copies in 1993.<BR>
<BR>
More important is the explosive rise in networks. Since 1989 the share of
US computers attached to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more
than 60 percent. Some 15 million are now attached to the network of networks--the
Internet--up from a few score thousand in 1989. For several years the Internet
grew at a pace of 15 percent per month.<BR>
<BR>
The fatal flaw of Silicon Graphics, 3DO, AT&amp;T, Raynet, Eon and QVC is
that they are trying to solve the problems of the telephone, TV, videogame
and consumer appliance companies. The problems of these separate industries
are unsolvable in the face of the integrating sweep of the computer networking
industry juggernaut. Television problem solving just distracts computer
firms from their huge and hugely demanding opportunity to usurp phones,
televisions and videogame players entirely with multimedia PCs and networks.
The huge telecom and consumer firms must be enlisted in their true role:
supplying networks, peripherals and programs for the computer industry.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood may still be full of glamour, but the surest sell sign for a technology
company is still a star- struck CEO. It is not altogether reassuring to
hear Terrence Garnett, Oracle's vice-president, multimedia, discussing his
boss' place in the industry. After schmoozing at a party with Hollywood
stars, Garnett confided to a reporter: &quot;I would have a hard time picturing
Lewis Platt [president of Hewlett Packard] sitting at that party. I mean,
you look at Larry Ellison and you could see him in that environment. I couldn't
see Jim Manzi [president of Lotus Development] or Philippe Kahn [president
of Borland] there. They don't look good in Armani.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most Hollywood-savvy executive of Silicon Valley is Jerry Sanders of
Advanced Micro Services. Star-struck at age 20 and bent on becoming a star,
he discovered shortly afterward that actors are mostly fungible functions
and their glamour mostly meretricious. Rather than trying to get rich in
Hollywood, he decided to enjoy Hollywood on his own terms after he got rich
in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
The irony is that technology companies actually hurt the movie business
more than they help it. The central message of Life After Television for
the film industry is that the new technologies are targeted directly at
Hollywood. Today some 70 percent of the costs of a film go to distribution
and advertising. In every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key
impact of the computer networking revolution is to collapse the costs of
distribution and remove the middlemen. The movie business is now mostly
middlemen. In an information industry such as the movie business, distribution
costs will predictably plummet if the movie business embraces networking.
<H3>TVs And Telephones: Change Or Crash</H3>
Anyone with access to the information superhighway will be able to distribute
a film at a tiny fraction of current costs. Moreover, webs of glass and
light will free the producer from the burden of creating a product that
can attract miscellaneous audiences to theaters. Instead, producers will
be able to reach equally large but more specialized audiences dispersed
around the globe. Rather than making lowest- common-denominator appeals
to the masses, film makers will be able to appeal to the special interests,
ambitions and curiosities of individuals anywhere, anytime.<BR>
<BR>
Limiting these opportunities at present are both the bottleneck of telephone
nets and the runaway costs of film making. Personal computers will not only
pulverize the costs of distribution, they will also drastically diminish
the costs of actual film production. Today leading directors can still imagine
that they alone command the capital to deploy the new digital production
and editing tools. But any capability now costing a few hundred thousand
dollars is sure to cost less than $20,000 in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Just as digital desktop publishing equipment unleashed thousands of new
text-publishing companies, so the new digital desktop video-publishing systems
will unleash thousands of new filmmakers. The video business will increasingly
resemble not the current film business, in which output is 100 or so movies
a year, but the book business, in which some 55,000 new hardcover titles
are published annually in the US alone. After all, scores of thousands of
screenplays are already written every year. In the next decade thousands
of screenwriters will be able to make and distribute their own films.<BR>
<BR>
Hollywood, meanwhile, will move toward providing enhanced experiences through
virtual reality and other expensive technologies. The current harbinger
is Circus Circus' Luxor resort in Las Vegas, a gigantic pyramid that is
briefly the world's largest hotel. Luxor is not just another Vegas casino:
It serves chiefly as a dormitory for six ride-film theaters on the first
floor. Luxor cost some $375 million to build. The largest expense was the
$40 million invested in the ride-films at the heart of the project. The
individual who made these films was Douglas Trumbull, formerly Hollywood's
leading supplier of special effects and now an enemy of the Hollywood establishment.
He is pioneering the new technologies of theatrical presentation--a field
abandoned by Hollywood in the 1950s when antitrust laws were interpreted
as barring film companies from owning theaters. Trumbull's first ride-film
hit, the incandescent Back to the Future, The Ride, saved the Universal
Theme Park in Orlando and set a new technical standard for the medium.<BR>
<BR>
Life After Television did not merely predict a technical revolution; it
predicted a cultural upheaval. Moving authority from elites and establishments
to creators and customers, the new technologies drastically change the cultural
balance of power. Shifting the optimal target of commercial art from vulgar
taste and sensations to special interests, curiosities, hobbies, ambitions
and artistic aspirations, digital multimedia machines will transform the
marketplace and elevate the culture. Only by addressing the new opportunities
will companies prosper and prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Computer networks are the pivotal technology of the new era. They are the
chief engine of the division of labor--the force of creativity and specialization
that Adam Smith identified as the key driver of economic growth. And they
are the reigning spearhead of the creative destruction that Joseph Schumpeter
saw as the key to all economic progress. The domonetics of computer networks
are active and dynamic rather than passive and diversionary. Unlike games
and movies, computer networks endow people with new powers of self-improvement
and wealth creation. They free individuals from the shackles of corporate
bureaucracy and geography and allow them to collaborate and exchange ideas
with the best colleagues anywhere in the world. Computer networks give every
hacker the creative potential of a factory tycoon of the industrial era
and the communications power of a TV magnate of the broadcasting era.<BR>
<BR>
The accelerating spread of computer networks in the early 1990s explains
the high sense of opportunity and possibility in an economy otherwise in
the doldrums. To prevail all industries will have to adapt to network powers
and constraints. This means telephone and TV companies will have to change
or crash. It also means that to fulfill the promise of the Information Age,
computer companies will have to adapt to the laws of the microcosm and telecosm.
They will have to stop dallying with game machines and set-top boxes, stop
their infatuation with Hollywood and embrace the empowering promise of their
own machines.<BR>
<BR>
Leading any list of companies that grasp this reality are Apple and Intel.
Both have made large strides in the past year toward the overthrow of the
establishments of consumer electronics, telephony and television.<BR>
<BR>
Although Apple suffered sharp setbacks in 1993, the &quot;teleputer&quot;
strategy launched by John Sculley in recent years began to bear fruit that
same year in such pioneering products as the Quicktime multimedia operating
system, the Macintosh TV and the Mac Quadra 840AV.<BR>
<BR>
First came the Mac TV, which boldly subsumed a full cable-ready television
set in a Macintosh computer, together with a stereo CD-ROM drive, all in
one chassis. Connectable to a VCR, camcorder, laserdisc or videogame player,
the Mac TV cost around $2,000 and signals a new epoch.<BR>
<BR>
Moving still closer to the teleputer ideal of the multimedia production
center is the Mac Quadra 840AV. Standing for audio-visual, the AV fulfills
the ultimate promise of the teleputer as a device that can not only display
digital video but also store, edit and transmit it. With input port for
all TV standards--including the European PAL and the American NTSC and studio
modes S-video and composite video--the Quadra AV can convert analog images
to a digital bit stream to be stored, edited and then transmitted. The AV
can also function as a phone and stereo and contains an advanced digital
signal processor that imparts powers of speech recognition and synthesis.
Rivaled as a multimedia machine only by the most costly and powerful Silicon
Graphics Indy workstation, the Quadra AV is unique in its pattern-matching
and voice-recognition features.<BR>
<BR>
In early December 1993 in Tokyo, Apple introduced the latest version of
Quicktime running Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG standard) video at
30 frames per second on a Mac Quadra. Fujitsu Ltd.'s announcement that it
was licensing the technology for its own line of video computers signified
a growing awareness that Quicktime was becoming a worldwide multimedia standard
even before the Kaleida multimedia system and the so-called Power PC emerged
from an Apple-IBM partnership.<BR>
<BR>
Fulfilling Sculley's promise of usurping both phone and television set,
these new computers and their software represent the first generation of
the multimedia era. Already an upside surprise, the Quadra 840AV moved quickly
to the forefront among Apple best-sellers, showing that Apple can still
do best in the marketplace through genuine innovations. These technologies
do not ape the price points and form factors of consumer electronics; they
do not hunker down or twist themselves into pretzels to fit in a set- top
box. These products extend the PC imperium into new territory.<BR>
<BR>
However, in a world with Intel chieftain Andy Grove aboard, Apple cannot
rest on its teleputer laurels. Intel is still more fiercely focused on the
prize. As Grove says: &quot;The PC is it. That sums up Intel's business
plan and rallying cry.&quot; Scorning the obsession with set-top boxes elsewhere
in the industry, he explains: &quot;The PC is already in 30 percent of the
nation's homes. How long will it be before these new set-top boxes are in
30 percent of homes? And what will PCs be doing by then? The PC is not any
one thing. It is a continuing phenomenon, and every couple years its definition
changes. The Intel goal is to make sure that the living organism of the
PC evolves in the right direction to continue as the dominant interactive
appliance in both home and business. The PC is not a fixed product but a
continuum. By contrast, the set-top box is a stationary machine. The set-top
box won't have the volume, the installed base, the software or the adaptability
of the PC. By the time they get all the necessary functions into the set-top
box at the right price point, the PC will be controlling the TV as a mere
peripheral.&quot; Grove's warning is exactly on target. 
<H3>Bandwidth Frees Computers' True Power</H3>
Bruce Ryon, Dataquest's chief multimedia analyst, observes: &quot;If you
talk to the cable set-top box guys, they are all saying that they are not
going to get to the price points they need until three to five years out.&quot;
After three to five more years of Moore's Law, the PC will be a multimedia
machine with some eight times the power and storage capacity at the same
price that brought nearly 50 million unit sales in 1993 and, according to
Robertson Stephens' Klesken, promises to bring some 55 million unit sales
in 1994. At this pace, within four or five years, PC penetration into homes
will pass 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all these PCs will be connected to networks--most of them with
10 megabits per second or more of bandwidth--and most will run internal
buses (linking processors to memory and display) at rates of close to a
billion bits per second, ample for full-motion video.<BR>
<BR>
These new PCs being prepared at Intel and Apple will merge with the new
tools of the information superhighway. Technologies of fiber optics and
wireless communications, glass and air, they are advancing as fast as the
microchip technologies of sand. Together they will consummate the computer
revolution and wreak a new revolution in telecom.<BR>
<BR>
Until endowed with broadband connections, the computer is a cripple that
devotes huge portions of its processing power merely to compressing, decompressing,
coding and decoding its data for the telephone system bottleneck. It is
because of this bottleneck that the true power of the PC remains obscure
to many observers. It is because of this bottleneck that the TV and consumer
electronics industries can imagine themselves a significant rivals to the
PC. But once provided with broadband communications, the PC will come fully
into its exponential harvest from microcosm to telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
As Grove points out: &quot;Infinite processing power will get you only so
far with limited bandwidth. But the coming era of nearly free bandwidth
will liberate the computer to fulfill its powers. Just as the 1980s saw
the demolition of the vertical structure of the computer industry, so the
1990s will see the demolition of the vertical structure of the communications
industry.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
To accelerate the day, at the December 1993 Western Cable TV Show, Intel
announced that it is developing a new computer on-ramp for the information
superhighway. In league with General Instrument and Hybrid Technology, Intel
demonstrated a modem to connect computers to cable TV coax at Ethernet speeds
of 10 megabits per second. One of several firms preparing to release computer
powers onto cable networks, Intel has the manufacturing clout and marketing
power to make cable PC a widespread reality.<BR>
<BR>
To prepare for this new era of broadband teleputing, Intel is introducing
a new bus standard, PCI, that runs at video speeds--around a gigabit per
second. With Apple's recent endorsement, PCI seems likely to become the
prevailing system for personal computer internal communications. At the
same time, Intel announced a full desktop teleconferencing system. Doggedly
pursuing the dual goal of integrating both voice and video with the computer,
Intel is far more ready to exploit the new era than firms panting after
Paramount and Nintendo.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, neither the Intel nor the Apple machines bring nirvana. As
multimedia guru Eric Hoffert of Apple points out, the consummated teleputer
requires 10 key advances. They include an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
interface, fast real-time compression/decompression chips, a full 64-bit
microprocessor, a real-time operating system that can schedule events for
specific times, internal buses that run the gigabits-per-second of raw high-definition
video flows, networked multimedia standard software to sustain new applications,
and improved human interfaces for multimedia communication and access to
media databases. Furthermore, the teleputer will demand huge storage devices
for the many gigabytes of data in ambitious multimedia projects. Finally,
it will entail new ways of encrypting and metering information so that the
creators can be paid for each access rather than requiring customers to
&quot;buy the reservoir,&quot; as Wave Systems chief Peter Sprague puts
it, &quot;every time you want a drink of water.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although these capabilities are available today, their cost remains in the
scores of thousands of dollars. Without these features, even the AV and
the Indy suffer nagging limits in storing, processing, editing and transmitting
the full-motion, full-screen, high-resolution digital video of our dreams.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if this were the television industry, such a machine would remain
a dream for decades to come. But in the entrepreneurial crucible of the
PC industry, all these dreams can come true at the remorseless pace of Moore's
Law. Within the next five years, cheap desktop machines could not only show
digital movies of full quality and resolution, but also create, edit and
transmit them.<BR>
<BR>
With this development at hand, all through Wall Street a warning is whispered:
&quot;The train is leaving the station.&quot; Content is scarce. If you
don't get it now, you will be left behind with the nerds in polyester.<BR>
<BR>
So why didn't Andy Grove join the race with Viacom's Sumner Redstone, QVC's
Barry Diller and all the rest for the grand prize of Paramount? Couldn't
someone at Intel find him an Armani suit? Paramount is worth $10 billion.
Intel is worth around $25 billion. It could easily swallow up the movie
giant and combine the Intel computer and communications tools with Paramount's
creative treasures.<BR>
<BR>
Even more significant, though, if the train is leaving the station, where
is America's sometimes richest man, the world's leading digital software
tycoon? Most of the prerequisites for the multimedia teleputer are software
projects now under way at Microsoft. Why didn't Bill Gates join the Hollywood
rush? He is famously pursuing content, digitizing famous works of art. Like
Grove, Gates commands a company worth close to $25 billion. Gates could
scoop up Paramount into his content venture, Continuum Productions, and
become as famous and fashionable as he is rich.<BR>
<BR>
But Gates is the epitome of PC domonetics. Gates doesn't even own a TV set.
Without mentioning movies or games, he can spiel off dozens of detailed
ideas for applications for the digital highway in the time it takes John
Malone to list his market tests and caveats. Gates invested nearly 10 years
of fatigue and futility, money and energy in the CD-ROM market as an alternative
to TV. Today's triumph of the CD-ROM is a supreme vindication of Gates'
PC strategy. Why should he abandon it now?<BR>
<BR>
Train leaving the station? Gates told Forbes ASAP, &quot;That's a joke.&quot;
Gates has always acted on the assumption that Microsoft--or, more generally,
the PC--is the train and he is driving it. In 1985 he declared: &quot;Television
is passive entertainment. We're betting that people want to interact, choose
different paths and get feedback from the machine about what they have really
learned.&quot; Almost a decade later, in the January 10, 1994, New Yorker,
he was still making the same point. Calling interactive TV &quot;a really
bad name for the in-home device connected to the information highway,&quot;
he stated: &quot;The bottom line is that two-way communication is a very
different beast than one-way communication... A phone that has an unbelievable
directory [and] lets you talk or send messages to lots of people, and works
with text and pictures is a better analogy than TV... Because TV had very
few channels, the value of TV time was very high so only things of very
broad interest could be aired on those few channels. The information highway
will be the opposite of this--more like the Library of Congress but with
an easy way to find things.&quot; Exactly the message of Life After Television.<BR>
<BR>
Gates did not hustle after Hollywood. Barry Diller and Michael Ovitz had
to seek him out in Seattle. Bill Gates has fiercely focused Microsoft on
the PC culture. In the NT operating system, he is pushing a system with
multimedia interfaces, which thrusts Microsoft into the middle of the fray
in computer multiprocessing and computer networking. That is the heart of
the new era. 
<H3>PC's Superior Demographics</H3>
The reason Gates and Grove are not interested in Paramount is no mystery.
They don't need it. They already command a much larger, faster-growing,
more creative and more promising vehicle for their capital. Selling nearly
50 million units in 1993, at an average price some four times higher than
that of a TV, the PC is not only a bigger market than television and movies
put together, it is also a better market in every way. In 1992 the US computer
industry commanded total sales of $161 billion, compared with $104 billion
in total revenues for TV and films. The revenues from computer hardware
sales were more than six times the revenues from TV sales, and home computer
sales were growing 10 times as fast. More important, the demographics of
the PC industry are far superior. Television buyers are median American
couch potatoes who pay some $400 for their machines. PC buyers mostly come
from the upper income quintiles, usually have higher education and pay an
average of some $1,500 for their machines and then put out another $1,500
or so for software and peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
Most crucial of all is the difference in the use of the two devices. While
TV watchers use their machines to lull themselves and their children into
a stupor, PC users exploit their machines to become yet richer and smarter
and more productive--and still better able to exploit future computer advances.
The PC customer is also the creator of new applications and add-on devices.
The TV is a consumption product. The PC is a supply-side investment in the
coming restoration of the home to a central role in the productive dynamics
of capitalism, and the transformation of capitalism into a healing force
in the present crisis of home and family, culture and community.<BR>
<BR>
How can this be when the computer is so often condemned as a divisive and
polarizing force in American life, the tool of an elite of nerds, a weapon
of dehumanizing bureaucracy? These charges were partly valid for the mainframe
computers of old. But as the PC gains communications powers and evolves
into a teleputer, its social, cultural and political impacts change completely.
As it ushers in a life beyond TV, it becomes a powerful force for democracy,
individuality, community and high culture.<BR>
<BR>
The leading-edge computers always go first to the elites who can use them
best and help develop them for others. All new technologies are first purchased
by elites and mastered by them before they reach a larger public. The PC
plays a role in contemporary culture resembling the role of the Model T
automobile in 20th-century industrial culture.<BR>
<BR>
Owners of the Model T could not simply jump in and drive the machine. They
had to learn how to maintain and repair it. Many of them learned how to
take it apart and put it back together. They became an industrial elite
with the mechanical skills that won two world wars and propelled the US
to the forefront of the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, the linked PCs of today and the teleputer networks of tomorrow
seem formidable--difficult to get in and drive. At times they appear to
be the tools of a new elite. But teleputers feed on the most rapid learning
curves in the world economy, and in proportion to their powers are the cheapest
technologies in history. Just as the TV, once an exotic tool of elites,
became even more ubiquitous in America than the telephone or the automobile,
the teleputer will end the decade not as a luxury but as an indispensable
appliance.<BR>
<BR>
It is companies that shun the PC of today in order to cater to the TV, consumer
electronics and telephone industries that will end up in luxury backwaters.
They will resemble the companies that catered to the mainframe trade early
in this decade, or those that catered to the horse business early in this
century. They may find exotic or intriguing niches. Yet just as the real
action was not at Churchill Downs or the Peapack Hunt Club but in Detroit,
the real action today--the source of wealth and power--is not at Nintendo
or Sega, Hollywood or QVC. It is in the scores of thousands of computer
and software companies that make up the industrial fabric of the Information
Age--the exhilarating new life after television.<BR>

<BR>
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder's </A>conservative cult classic, <I>Visible
Man</I>, is gaining attention in the midst of intense debates over welfare
reform and racism. Republication of <I>Visible Man</I>  is nothing if not
timely. <BR>
<BR>
In <I>Visible Man</I>, Gilder tells the the true story of Sam, a black youth
of the Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. For Gilder,
Sam is not a victim of racism, but the all-too conspicuous victim of government
policy. As the message of<I>Visible Man</I>  spreads the popularity of the
book seems to pick up momentum. <BR>
<BR>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich's monthly newsletter, &quot;Renewing
American Civilization,&quot; will feature <I>Visible Man </I>as the cover
article in November, and the book has been chosen as a monthly selection
for the newsletter's reader's circle. Gingrich, also has expressed interest
in including <I>Visible Man</I>  in the curriculum for his &quot;Renewing
American Civilization&quot; college course in 1996. Currently Reader's Digest
is considering publication of <I>Visible Man</I>  in a condensed form. In
August, Michael Medved had Gilder as a special guest on the Rush Limbaugh
radio program, which Medved guest-hosted while Limbaugh was on vacation.

Rather a good local Russian  restaurant. Somebody asked Vladimir whether this was the kind of food he  ate at home. He smiled politely. An adequate response.</P>  <P>Dr. Vladimir Raskin, according to the invitation, is Deputy Director  for International Relations of the Moscow Research Center for Human Rights.  The Center is &quot;an outgrowth of the human rights work of the late Andrei  Sakharov and his widow, Elena Bonner, is on the board of directors.&quot;  Raskin, an engineer by training, &quot;has been doing human rights work  in Russia since the beginning of the decade.&quot; Slender, late thirtysomething,  light hair, bright eyes, and insofar as such physical types exist, clearly  Russian.</P>  <P>My sense of him: You can trust this man.</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin's presentation deals with freedom of expression and the state  of Russia's media - an appropriate topic for &quot;the second event of  the Freedom of Expression Program of the Henry M. Jackson School of International  Relations, University of Washington, funded by a grant from the Henry M.  Jackson Foundation and co-sponsored by the Discovery Institute.&quot; So  states the invitation. This will be an evening of words about words.</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin's English is excellent. His words are plain, a simplicity  common to those who've known extreme experiences and uncertainty and danger  as a way of life. What does it mean to have done &quot;human rights work&quot;  since the beginning of the decade? Depends on where you do it, I suppose.  Those who've had extreme experiences of any kind do not need extreme words  to describe them. In this case, &quot;human rights work&quot; will do.  But it helps to look in their eyes when they talk, and to imagine what  they've seen besides you.</P>  <P>According to Dr. Raskin, there is now freedom of expression in Russia,  insofar as the central government no longer does what it once did. The  problems come from other sources: local officials, the new business class,  and crime. The media can't support themselves on subscribers and, apparently,  advertising's not that far advanced. So they get government support or  draw business money. In either case, it's the old story. Take care around  those who feed you, or who can make your life difficult, or take it from  you. &quot;The media practice self-censorship,&quot; he says.</P>  <P>Other problems: While the Moscow and Petersburg media have vastly improved,  their reach is still limited and most Russians care primarily for local  news, which is where the strictures are. &quot;People are poor,&quot; he  says. &quot;They can't afford to subscribe to more than one newspaper.  They want the local news.&quot; And also, he adds, they want their news  from media that confirm their own political beliefs and, in some cases,  personal prejudices. The best thing that could happen to the Russian media,  he believes, would be foreign investment. So far, that hasn't happened.</P>  <P>The trend in this country is toward the local. We believe it enhances  our freedom. When foreigners buy American media, people howl. Clearly,  when it comes to promoting democracy, one size does not fit all.</P>  <P>The talk turns to that peculiarly American cultural artifact, infotainment.  Yes, it's trivial and it trivializes, but it's also a very flexible format  and can be a dandy weapon, if used adroitly. Might a Russian infotainment  prove useful? Dr. Raskin laughs. Russian writers have a long history of  embedding their real messages. True enough, but there's still a difference  between Dostoevsky and &quot;Hard Copy.&quot; Not to worry: Russia's getting  that, too. There's a growing market for scandal. And, in any event, the  profits off trash can subsidize other work.</P>  <P>Does anybody in Russia care about NATO expansion? Not really. The south  is the problem, not the west. What about Lebed? There's always a chance  that he'll grow. How do you become a journalist in Russia? You go to the  university. You get the degree. And then you look for the job. What kinds  of people go into human rights work? All kinds. Why do you think that Americans  have been so indifferent to the miracles happening in Russia, and the agonies?</P>  <P>Dr. Raskin pauses. But it's not a pause of self-censorship - a don't-offend-the-check-writers  thing. There's a moment in his eyes, of his eyes, before he answers. &quot;I  think it's because they're busy with their own problems.&quot; All existence,  like all politics, is local. I remember a line from the film version of  Solzhenitsyn's <I>One Day in the Life of Ivan </I>Denisovich. You can't  expect somebody who's warm to understand somebody who's cold. Or to understand  the relationship between extreme experiences and simple words.</P>  <P>The man sitting next to me asks me why I think Americans haven't responded.  A fair question, since I asked Dr. Raskin and that gets him off the hook.  I answer that I don't think we're capable of responding. Left unsaid, self-censored:  You can't expect somebody who's warm to understand somebody who's cold.</P>  <P>And also, in a certain sense, nations are a lot like people. To those  who are faking it, the existence of those who aren't can be an awful reproach.  Better not to look in their eyes.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a regular columnist for the Washington Times.</I></B></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>

No USSR, no new  Axis is likely to appear.</P>  <P>2)  It is possible, indeed probable, that sometime within the next few  years, thousands of Americans, perhaps many times that number, will be  killed or injured by a nuclear, biological, or chemical Weapon of Mass  Destruction (WMD) &shy; the greatest carnage on this continent since the  Civil War. The people I talk to in the military and in counter-terrorism  tell me that, given the proliferation of these weapons and a variety of  crude but functional delivery means, it's now a matter of when, not if.</P>  <P>3)  The United States has no real defense against such attacks and,  apparently, no serious intention of acquiring one. Continental ballistic  missile defense is nonexistent, air defense not much better. Counter-terrorism  is parceled out among literally hundreds of agencies, inter-agency groups,  and task forces.</P>  <P>4)  The United States will spend over $300 billion this year on defense  and an array of defense related activities. Most of this money will go  for expeditionary forces, i.e., forces intended and configured to fight  elsewhere. Nobody believes that this force can be maintained, let alone  modernized, on any conceivable peacetime budget.</P>  <P>5)  Humanitarian and other-than-war uses of the military may be expected  to increase. That inserts us into the problems and passions of others.</P>  <P>6)  A lot of these &quot;others,&quot; and a lot of their supporters,  wouldn't mind hurting us.</P>  <P>     From this admittedly unoriginal assessment, two equally unoriginal  conclusions emerge. The first is that there's no money, at least if present  spending patterns and priorities are maintained. The second is that, the  more we mess in other people's problems - or, if you prefer, the more we  exercise &quot;global leadership&quot; and keep our commitments - the more  likely we are to get hit at home.</P>  <P>     So what's a country to do?</P>  <P>     For starters, recognize two facts of life and begin to ponder the  implications of a third.</P>  <P>1)  When you aggregate a current miscellany  of activities - anti-missile  and anti-air defense, defense against WMD delivered by other means, counter-terrorism,  drug interdiction, border control - you find that they add up to homeland  defense, which is the first mission of any democracy's military.</P>  <P>2)  The United States only needs homeland defenses if we pursue an activist  foreign policy. Were America to embrace genuine isolationism, there would  be scant need for Fortress America. Many people would still hate us, but  few would care to attack us and risk retaliation. Leadership and activism,  not isolationism, require homeland defense. Not having it means that, someday,  a president may have to choose between disaster and submission to threat  or blackmail.</P>  <P>3)  In human conflict, as in all other aspects of contemporary existence,  previously clear boundaries are blurring. It may no longer be possible  to make neat distinctions between war and crime, i.e., between the military  and law enforcement spheres. When subnational groups and even individuals  may have the power to do us more harm than most nation-states, it's a new  world. The military may prefer only to do certain things under certain  conditions. It may no longer be possible to honor those preferences.</P>  <P>     But how to defend the homeland when threats are diffuse, cash running  low, and  dangers to civil liberties and constitutional rights only too  apparent? The answer may lie in two words: dual use - systems and organizations  that can function in both expeditionary and homeland defense roles.</P>  <P>     At the hardware level, for example, anti-missile systems designed  to protect troops in the field and theater-level operations might be adapted  for domestic use against shorter-range missiles. Ships can protect the  coast of New Jersey as well as the coast of Saudi Arabia. At the people  level, the National Guard - too often and too easily dismissed as archaic  - is a classic dual use system. Available to both governors and the president,  the Army Guard is on-site, knows the physical and human territory, and  already performs a variety of quasi-military/quasi-law enforcement missions  of relevance in homeland defense. It's a far more appropriate force for  working with local police and disaster relief agencies than federal troops.  The Air Guard has long held continental air defense responsiblities. Whatever  the Guard's value as the nation's expeditionary reserve (a value greater  than many care to admit), its potential as a homeland defense force is  enormous. </P>  <P>     But will anybody get serious about homeland defense before some  disaster gets everybody asking why nobody ever got serious about homeland  defense? One indicator may be the Quadrennial Defense Review now underway  at the Pentagon. The history of such efforts, most recently the Commission  on Roles and Missions, indicates that they generate little save uneasy  compromises, artful dodging, and <I>per diem</I> claims. This one may be  different, given that it may no longer be possible to &quot;ration the  poverty&quot; among the services. But cuts themselves mean less than restructuring,  the realignment of roles and missions, and - could it happen? - at least  a theoretical recognition of the growing need for homeland defense.</P>  <P>      Deputy Defense Secretary John White, who chaired the last commission,  claims that &quot;Everything is on the table.&quot; To translate from Beltwayese  into plain English, that  usually means that a rather intricate charade  is about to begin, an elaborate pretense resulting in little real change.  Perhaps this time will be different. And  one indicator of real change  could be whether homeland defense - <I>the common defense</I> - even gets  to the table at all.</P>  <P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based Discovery  Institute and director of &quot;ReVisioning Defense: Protecting the People,  Defending the Defenders,&quot; a Discovery Institute project in cooperation  with the Heritage Foundation.</I></B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P> </P><P>      </P><P> </P><P>     <BR></BODY></HTML>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I learned about the Bucks County Coffee Company through the
younger sister of a former lover. She's a regional manager now. The sister,
not the lover (a Carter White House staffer now wed to a gentleman squire
farmer. We talk.) I did a magazine story on the company five years ago,
a favorable piece which duly impressed the boss of the sister of the lover,
and which garnered me a pass to their coffee nut &amp; chocolate warehouse
whenever I happen to visit Langhorne, Pa. I'll probably get another batch
of goodies out of this essay, but that's not why I'm writing it. I tell
myself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bucks got going in 1981, when Rodger Owen, a Navy veteran and bored executive,
bought a book on nuts, 25 pounds of cashews, and a little deep fat fryer
that he had a volunteer fireman rig up in his garage. After saturating his
primary market (the neighbors) he rented a 300 square foot carriage house
in downtown Yardley, Pa., conveniently near the town's only traffic light.
Rodger started advertising mail-order nuts in the <I>New Yorker</I> under
the name &quot;Squire's Choice&quot; (an unintended reference to the sister
of one of his future regional managers). He prospered, went into coffee,
named the new endeavor after its home, and today the Buck County coastal
empire boasts 42 stores, coffee houses, and kiosks from New Jersey to Washington,
DC. The coffee is good. The service is friendly. The Emperor presides. And,
until the arrival of the Conquistadors, there was peace.<BR>
<BR>
According to <I>Newsweek's</I> 18 September article, &quot;Not in My Backyard,&quot;
Starbucks has over 970 stores, with plans for 2,000 by 2000. But a popular
backlash may be developing, as non-northwest indigenous peoples struggle
to protect their local coffee cultures from the depredations and ravishments
of the newcomers. Indeed, if you believe a student columnist in <I>the Daily
Princetonian</I>, &quot;Starbucks is notorious for waiting for other coffee
shops to create a niche and then coming in with its sleazy old brand-name
recognition and usurping all the business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Bucks has a coffeehouse/Internet caf&eacute; in Princeton. Starbucks recently
opened down the street. Still, since Bucks' Princeton facility attracts
far more townspeople than students, and since the author (a certain Snow
Tempest, '97, English major) never mentions Bucks, but does allude to &quot;Small
World Coffee&quot; and &quot;Harry's Luncheonette,&quot; one may assume
that she neither flacks for Bucks nor has access to their warehouse.<BR>
<BR>
Rodger Owen lacks Ms. Tempest's, well, tempestuousness. Indeed, he exudes
benign serenity and multicultural tact. Owen says that in the areas where
Bucks and Starbucks go bean-to-bean, he's holding his own. &quot;In many
ways, they're a good competitor. It's not like going against Wal-Mart. You're
not forced to compete on price.&quot; He knows that in some places Starbucks
has conducted saturation operations. Still, says Owen, &quot;Starbucks is
good for the business because they help build awareness of coffee.&quot;
Then he warns: &quot;Starbucks needs competition. People are fickle. If
Starbucks were the only [specialty] coffee purveyor, people will find another
beverage.&quot; <BR>
Concludes Mr. Owen: &quot;I have nothing but admiration for Starbucks. They
put out a quality product. They don't cut corners. Our biggest virtue is
that they're great and we're not them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
How exquisitely multicultural. <I>They're great and we're not them</I>.
In fact, it's surprising how many ways Starbucks differs from its alternative-coastal
coffee competition. The eastern tribes generally prefer lighter roasts.
Starbucks roasts so darkly that some among the natives call it, &quot;Charbucks.&quot;
The eastern tribes like flavored coffees. Starbucks eschews such undeveloped
tastes. Starbucks sells mostly drop-in and carry-out beverages. Bucks earns
over half its money in bean sales, much of that bought in supermarket kiosks
that often double as real-reality chat rooms Starbucks has moved into milk-based
beverages. Bucks makes a mocha crush that can give a frappacino chills,
but still concentrates on the hot stuff, which it offers in a polystyrene
cup that, Rodger asserts, is both easier to handle and more environmentally
benign than Starbuck's finger-stinging paper.<BR>
<BR>
Yet none of this really captures the spiritual aspect of east coast coffee,
or suggests that Starbucks can operate for long in such hostile territory
without spiritual damage of its own. The eastern tribes live harried lives.
Rodger sells them moments of peace, quiet times in the morning and evening
when they withdraw into themselves with their mix of French Roast and Hazelnut
(two-thirds/one-third), or Costa Rica La Minita Estate, or Yemen Mocha Mattari,
or Amaretto, or Ethiopia Yirgacheffe. In fact, says Rodger, &quot;People
enjoy standing in line for their coffee. I've been criticized by some of
my landlords because my lines are too long. I tell them it's their morning
pause. And,&quot; he adds, &quot;maybe a chance to stand in line next to
some one interesting.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Bucks offers solace, communion, the call of the mini-retreat. Starbucks,
curiously, has taken on the frenetic quick-in/quick-out ambiance of the
eastern tribes. (Try DC's Dupont Circle and Georgetown locations if you
want to get jolted by more than caffeine.) It's as though the natives have
reserved their gentleness and grace for their own, meanwhile corrupting
the intruders with their coarser ways.<BR>
<BR>
If so, it wouldn't be the first time in history that Conquistadors found
themselves afflicted with the ills of the conquered. Nor would it be inappropriate
to suggest that some of the east coast's native remedies for incivility
and spiritual unease might have value here. If not as a civility therapy
(none needed, yet), then as an exercise in applied multiculturalism. Says
Rodger: &quot;Starbucks has come here. East coast coffee has never gone
west.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Celebrate diversity, Seattle. Try some east coast coffee. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

</H5>
<H5></H4><FONT FACE="Palatino"><FONT SIZE=3>We have crafted an era as abhorrent
to the future as to the past. Bill Clinton's as good a symbol of that era
as any.<BR>
<BR>
When John Kennedy wanted to author a book that would help him toward the
white House, he assembled (with <I>mucho</I> assistance from my old Georgetown
colleague, Jules Davids) <I>Profiles in Courage</I>. Jimmy Clinton borrowed
Admiral Rickover's imperious question, <I>Why not the Best?</I> for his
tome's title. Now Mr. Clinton has allowed his name to be associated with
<I>Between Hope and History</I> - an allusion to the site of his birth and
the locale where he will be remembered for at least eternity. A more accurate
title might have been,<I> Between Hype and Hubris. </I>A less pretentious
alternative: <I>The Gospel According to Bill</I>.<BR>
<BR>
This canonical (or is it apocryphorical?) document, written in a style perhaps
best described as trickle-down prose, begins by reminding the Republic that
&quot;[t]his book continues the conversation I have had with the American
people about our destiny as a nation . . . The Proverbs teach us that 'Where
there is no vision, the people perish.' I ran for President in 1992 because
I thought that our nation lacked a unifying vision for our future.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
So<I> that's</I> why he did it.<BR>
<BR>
The text next informs us that The Unifying Vision consists of Opportunity,
Responsibility and Community, all of which have been heftily advanced since
that magical moment when Bill took over. He offers hard examples - facts
and statistics spinning so wildly and weirdly that it's a wonder they stay
on the page - and buttresses them with Vivid Personal Examples. I remember
in 1992 how he responded so touchingly to the pain of a thirtysomething
male who moaned out at a rally, &quot;We're your children.&quot; My personal
favorite from this text: How an immigrant hotel worker, complaining that
his son wasn't safe on the streets, asked him, &quot;If I vote for you,
will you make my boy free?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The text does not record Mr. Clinton's response. Perhaps it ran along the
lines: &quot;Your faith has made him free. Go and sin no more.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In short, this book is pure political pap. Sensitivity aside, Phil Gramm
could have written it. But what makes this paean to vision so repellent
is the character (as buzzy a word of the 90s as relevance was to the 60s)
of the official author.<BR>
<BR>
In <I>Boy Clinton</I>, R. Emmett Tyrrell assesses that character. Mr. Tyrrell
might fairly be described as the John Wayne of conservative journalism.
You read him to read Tyrrell; the subject is the vehicle for the star. Tyrrell
has the virtue of consistency. A 60s campus conservative and founding editor
of &quot;The American Spectator,&quot; a fine and lively rag, what you see
is what you get. <I>Boy Clinton</I> is vintage Tyrrell: a stream of reportage
and scornfest, moving with the speed of, well, white water. He views Mr.
Clinton, his missus, and their breed as no more than 60s phonies, half student
council nerds, half countercultural radicals-of-convenience, who have learned
nothing and forgotten northing . . . and whose self-righteousness blinds
them even to their own criminality. <BR>
<BR>
Writes Mr. Tyrrell: &quot;They began their public lives in the petty charlatanry
of student government and ended in the 1990s as fit objects for grand jury
inquiries, government subpoenas, congressional investigations . . . chaos
is what he and Hillary are pleased to call public service.&quot; Mr. Tyrrell
also considers matters of sexual manners and mores, drugs, cash, and truth.
He concludes by predicting the Clintons' &quot;massive rejection by the
electorate.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And yet, massive rejection is precisely what is not happening. One reason
may be the sheer joy that Mr. Tyrrell and his legions take in trashing the
president. Mr. Tyrrell notes that, in 1992, Gennifer Flowers' charges got
lost amid the smarminess. Here they get lost amid the cleverness. And, in
a sense, Mr. Tyrrell has also learned nothing and forgotten nothing. He's
still fighting the 60s. Perhaps it's time to stop.<BR>
<BR>
And yet, the brilliant ineptitude of Mr. Tyrrell's assault - or the piteous
ineptitude of Mr. Dole's campaign - do not explain Mr. Clinton's resilience.
Jodie Allen, writing in &quot;Slate&quot; Magazine, argues that Clinton
may be the Nixon of the 90s - you hold your nose and give him his landslide.
Yet even this explanation seems inadequate. Time after time, in conversations
with liberals (especially women), people tell me that they like Mr. Clinton
because they see something of themselves in him. By conventional standards,
this would be impossible, or at least something you wouldn't want to brag
about. To what are these people relating? Certainly not his bimbos, his
draft record, his infatuation with cruise missiles, his ability to sell
you down the river (cabinet nominees, gays, welfare). Certainly not his
invocations of a morality that makes vanilla Dairy Queen positively piquant
by comparison. <BR>
<BR>
What's turning these people on?<BR>
<BR>
The answer may be as simple as it is ugly. We live in the Age of Getting
Away with It. Bill Clinton, more than any other American, Gets Away with
It. Part of this derives from the nature of politics. So many groups, so
many millions, believe they've nowhere else to go. They let him get away
with it. His personal morals may be repellent . . . but hey, who are we
to be judgmental? He gets away with it. Conservatives decry him as a pathological
liar. But hey, that's the way it is today. You know, image versus reality,
spin control. Everybody plays that game; Bill just plays it better. So he
gets away with it. And he gets away with it because he's more than the first
Baby Boomer president. He's also the first slacker president. Maureen Dowd,
writing in the &quot;New York Times,&quot; suggests that, while we may secretly
fear that we can't live up to Bob Dole's standards, we know we can meet
Bill Clinton's.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps. But he also gets away with it as a child would. He's a spoiled
prodigy who never got over it. He's a weird, postmodern Tom Sawyer. He's
&quot;Home Alone.&quot; He's Robin Williams in &quot;Jack.&quot; And we
treat him as such.<BR>
<BR>
We may or may not be Bill Clinton's children. He's certainly our child.
The Bible predicted that a child would lead. But history indicates that,
when children try, there's little reason for hope. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Great news from the Culture War. <BR>
<BR>
Political Correctness has entered its Brezhnev era. <BR>
<BR>
PC isn't dead, of course. Far from it. But the time has come to state, with
the serene certitude that only a vague metaphoric prophecy can generate,
that President Clinton (especially if re-elected) will go down in history
as the Leonid Brezhnev of PC . . . and that, five years from now, we may
be referring to the current Vice President as &quot;Goreby.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Here's what's coming down. <BR>
<BR>
The Brezhnev era (for those fortunate enough to know nothing about it) roughly
describes the Soviet Union during the twenty years between Nikita (&quot;Hare-Brained
Schemes&quot;) Khrushchev's enforced retirement and Mikhail (the original
&quot;Gorby&quot;) Gorbachev's ascent, i.e., mid-1960s to mid-1980s. The
Brezhnev clique and claque shipped Mr. K. back to his dacha for, among other
schemes, putting missiles in Cuba, wheat farms in Siberia, and venom in
the Sino-Soviet snuggle-fest. Gorby had only one hare-brained scheme: thinking
he could make communism work by giving people a taste of late 20<SUP>th</SUP>
century western alternatives (How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after
they've seen MTV?). But what concerns us here are the years between the
schemes, and what they tell us about the human soul. <BR>
<BR>
The Brezhnev era apparatus seemed omnipresent, invincible, expanding almost
at will. The Bolshies had also gone affluent. The future was secure. <BR>
<BR>
Yet within this structure of dominance, corruption took on a troika of forms.
The more cynical knew that the system was bankrupt, had nothing to offer,
and couldn't survive. They chose to enjoy it while it lasted. (Many have
since printed up new business cards.) The more vicious chose to exercise
power for the sake of power, in countless sterile oppressions at home, in
the construction of an utterly lunatic defense establishment, and in costly
foreign games. The more sincere and self-deluding, who still believed the
weary phrases, joined the vicious in pushing the system to what Polish dissident
Adam Michik once called the highest stage of communism: complete absurdity.
<BR>
<BR>
As for the rest, those who were neither vicious nor cynical nor self-deluding:
They went along. Later, many conceded that they had lived through a time
when theory collided with reality and lost - a time when ideological dementia
encountered sullen popular indifference, and lost to that, too. <BR>
<BR>
And so it is with PC today. The clique and claque are everywhere: the government
and courts, the universities and schools, the churches, the media, the family,
the street. But the sterility's starting to show. <BR>
<BR>
After all, once you've deconstructed everything, what's left to offer, create,
or preserve? After you've made it an article of faith that all human relationships
are based upon power, and all standards relative and oppressive, what's
to keep people from applying that notion to the explainers themselves? <BR>
<BR>
The life is gone. The PC promise of multi-cultural efflorescence and diversity
long ago segued into mere power politics. The PC promise of postmodern literature
and art and scholarship long ago sank, Marx-like, beneath its own pedantic
nihilism. And people know it, and are growing weary of it - not least of
all those young people who sit through the sensitivity training and the
screed-lectures and the rest with expressions that would not have been out
of place in Moscow, circa 1975. <BR>
<BR>
So the PC clique and claque begin to face their own Brezhnev era choices:
to take the money and power as long as it lasts; to become ever more bizarre
in their pursuits; or to just go along, evading the fact that PC suffers
from the same fatal deficiency as Marxism. It neither explains the world
adequately nor works well in it. Whether the claim be that there is only
one reality - the Marxist - or no reality at all, the net effect is the
same. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, the Soviet Union did not collapse from internal failure alone.
The United States hastened the demise in two ways. We kept the pressure
on, and we offered at least the image of alternatives. Inefficiency alone
was not enough to bring it down. There had to be a sense that something
better also existed, or could be made to exist. <BR>
<BR>
And that's how to bring down PC. Pressure and offer. Pressure the movement
toward the extremes of its own innate absurdity. It won't be hard; they're
already half-way there. Their weakness is their inability to abide any reality
(or unreality) other than their own, coupled with a lascivious desire to
exercise power for its own sake. It's an ugly combination, whether in the
courtroom or the classroom. Still, any movement that has reached the point
of claiming that the laws of physics are a sexist conspiracy can probably
be invited to prove it by jumping off the roof. <BR>
<BR>
And offer. The Republican Party and the conservative feminist movement now
terrify PC - not because they're movements of inclusion yet, but because
they could be. What might even a modest academic and literary renaissance
accomplish? PC rage nowadays has a curious quality: no longer the anger
of righteous indignation, just the shrill resentment of being challenged,
concealing - no longer completely - the beginnings of a fear that there's
nothing left inside, that perhaps there never was. <BR>
<BR>
And a fear that people might be noticing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Students of the military art</B> have long been familiar with the
Iron Law of the Inverse. This great truth holds, among other things, that
a service's leadership effectiveness is inversely proportional to the number
of generals available to lead; that combat ferocity is inversely proportional
to the quantity of medals awarded; and that a service's budgetary discipline
is inversely proportional to the amount of money thrown their way.<BR>
<BR>
Time, perhaps, to add a new codicil: The American military's long-term prospects
are inversely proportional to the slickness of their doctrinal brochures.<BR>
<BR>
Recent example: <I>Joint Vision 2010,</I> a 34-page, heavy-paper, glossy
 little pub, with several dozen  military action photos and busy full-color
schematics,  counterpointing modest quantities of large-type, double-spaced
prose. JV 2010 emanates from the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, but its style resonates of <I>New Townhome Community Prospectus
(80 percent Already Sold!),</I> or perhaps a mass mailout for a group of
recently incorporated Bill Gates wannabes, scavenging for start-up money.<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010, which recently hit the streets after months of  internal workup,
has a purple cover. This signifies jointness. (Those who labor at inter-service
tasks have long been known as &quot;purple suiters.&quot;) The pamphlet
begins with a statement from the Chairman, General John Shalikashvili, emphasizing
that modern warfare requires teamwork. The usually-obligatory quote from
the Commander-in-Chief appears conspicuous by its absence. But General Shalikashvili
writes that  that this little document provides &quot;an operationally based
template for the evolution of the Armed Forces for a challenging and uncertain
future.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010 goes on to explain that the future belongs to high technology: the
precision-guidance and information-age gizmos which will generate the capabilities
for: &quot;dominant maneuver; precision engagement; full dimensional protection;
and focused logistics.&quot; JV 2010 notes almost casually that, in some
cases, &quot;boots on the ground&quot; will still be necessary. But, clearly,
the future belongs to the machines.<BR>
<BR>
JV 2010 isn't wrong. The &quot;dazzle-'em-with-imagery&quot; format can't
quite conceal that this is a coherent, well-crafted approach to 21st century
warfare. But for two reasons, both beyond the military's control, this is
also a template for disaster.<BR>
<BR>
The first problem is perennial: Where's the money coming from? There is
simply no way the military can fund even a fraction of the necessary modernization
programs &shyp; necessary because the technologies to counter information-age
warfare are diffusing across the planet. Information-age forces are far
less vulnerable to destruction than disruption; a three-to-five year technological
lead is absolutely vital and easily lost.<BR>
<BR>
Money is also critical because of a condition peculiar to periods of rapid
technological change. Obviously, not everything can be modernized at once.
But insufficiently funded modernization can leave significant portions of
the force two and three generations behind, creating enormous interoperability
problems, especially in communications, supply, and maintenance. Incomplete
modernization could well result in a degraded active force and a marginal-to-useless
reserve . . . or a modernized but tiny active force and a semi-skilled,
cannon-fodder reserve.<BR>
<BR>
The second, and even more disturbing  failure involves the paper's attitude
toward weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The battlefield approach seems
sensible enough. Active measures (anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses,
among others) do what they can, while mobility and dispersion limit damage
on the ground. But JV 2010 nowhere mentions homeland protection, as though
the constitutional requirement to &quot;provide for the common defense&quot;
doesn't include the people and territory of the United States. Again, this
is primarily a political failure. But it would certainly have been an act
of military statesmanship, had JV 2010 contained a paragraph reading:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Today, the United States is involved in an unprecedented and potentially
catastrophic asymmetrical arms race. While we concentrate on precision-guidance
weaponry and information-age warfare, potential enemies (nation-states and
subnational groups) acquire WMD and a variety of crude but serviceable delivery
systems. New technologies permit development of active defenses that could
prove highly effective against small WMD attacks. Many of these defenses
could be adapted for homeland protection. Further, many defenses against
non-airborne WMD may have domestic uses. Finally, the National Guard should
be given WMD disaster relief as a high-priority mission, and trained and
equipped accordingly. Ironically, to the extent that we maintain invincible
conventional forces, potential enemies will be forced to consider terrorist
use of WMD, especially against this open society. We hope that deterrence
continues to work, even against the most fanatic rogue nations and their
terrorist clients. But it is always better to save lives than to avenge
them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Why hasn't this been said?<BR>
<BR>
The reasons are many, and often valid: unwillingness to defy the civilian
leadership; the possible effect on other military priorities; lack of funding;
reluctance to draw the military too deeply and openly into domestic counter-terrorism;
inertia; exhaustion. But it grows ever harder to avoid the conclusion that,
as a matter of professional as well as constitutional responsibility, the
military must begin to take homeland defense seriously.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1920s and 1930s, a diverse group of officers united around a common
goal: to get the United States some air power. Two decades of public advocacy,
professional struggle, and personal sacrifice paid off in World War II,
then laid the foundations for the aerospace dominance which the United States
has taken for granted ever since.  Perhaps it's time for a similar visionary
movement to emerge around homeland defense.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Less than a decade</B> after the great victories of the Cold War and
Desert Storm, the U.S. military faces a very different kind of crisis&oacute;indeed,
a crisis unique in all of military experience. Numerous factors have contributed:
a complex, volatile world situation; the spread of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD); the military technological revolution; deep budget cuts; and the
ill-advised use of the military to advance certain Politically Correct civilian
political and cultural agendas. Each of these problems can and must be addressed
individually, through normal policy channels. But, taken together, they
constitute a crisis so profound that the American people must also become
involved. Unfortunately, for reasons ranging from media bias to normal peacetime
inattentiveness, the American people have scant idea of either the depth
or the complexity of the crisis.<BR>
<BR>
It is time to make the people aware. It is also time for a new, historically
unprecedented covenant between the American people and the defense establishment
that exists to protect them, their territory, and their interests. In the
past, the American people have supported the military with their treasure,
and their sons and daughters. They shall continue to do so. But now &oacute;
and this is the essence of the new covenant &oacute; the American people
must defend their defenders against unwise and unwarranted civilian political
pressures and agendas. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives have argued for years against excessive budget cuts and imprudent
use of the military in other-than-war situations. But only in recent months
have conservatives and concerned centrists begun seriously to address the
problems of subjecting the military to social engineering and experimentation.
There has been outcry, and the marshaling of evidence. But, sadly and predictably,
the public debate has descended into a &igrave;rights versus readiness&icirc;
mode. Conservatives have argued the needs of the military while the PC left
has argued &igrave;rights&icirc; &oacute; unfortunately, a far more evocative
theme in this era. The conservative approach is necessary and correct, but
insufficient either to save the military or to place the military crisis
in a larger national context. Conservatives know that, ever since Vietnam,
the PC left has assailed the military as a strategic target in the Culture
War: the final bastion of traditional values. But conservatives naively
underestimated the tenacity and ferocity of the PC foe. The results are
now becoming clear: military resignations by the thousands, ruined careers
by the hundreds, suicides, and the gradual degradation of the ability to
fight. <BR>
<BR>
Conservatives (and concerned centrists and non-PC liberals) understand this.
But conservatives, by and large, have yet to do what the PC left has done
so successfully: make the military a cultural issue, and do so in a manner
relevant and compelling to the largest possible audience. There are two
reasons for this, both valid. First, many of those most knowledgeable about
the military tend not to venture beyond their area of expertise (a notable
and happy exception: decorated marine veteran, novelist, and former navy
secretary James Webb). Second, many conservatives of non-military background
stress only the need for traditional values: again, a correct and necessary
approach, but insufficient to reach and influence the widest possible audience.
<BR>
<BR>
This Discovery Inquiry provides a strategy for a &igrave;Culture Wars&icirc;
approach to military issues that can help generate the popular support necessary
for policy changes. The Inquiry has two parts. The first proposes the contours
of a new covenant between people and military. The second suggests the structure
of a new debate, through which conservatives and concerned centrists can
carry the subject to the largest possible audience: the general public as
well as decision-makers, analysts and punditry. Accordingly, this Inquiry
contains no policy recommendations. These will be provided in forthcoming
papers. What matters here is to introduce a concept that is as relevant
to the American society as to the American military, as relevant to the
Culture Wars of the last few decades as to future military conflicts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, Americans worried that the military might grow too distant
from the people. Today, the reverse has happened. The American military
has become too much like the society it exists to defend. Indeed, the military&iacute;s
crisis provides a metaphor for the ills of the culture as a whole. In a
sense, when Americans look at the military, they&iacute;re looking into
a mirror. <BR>
<BR>
And it&iacute;s time to start asking: Do we entirely like what we see?<BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>I. Toward a new covenant</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Any covenant between people and military must contain two
elements: a clear statement of what the people expect and require of the
military, and a statement of what they&iacute;re prepared to do to ensure
that the military meets these requirements. But first, it would be useful
to clarify one of the most abused and misunderstood concepts in the American
political lexicon: civilian control of the military.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Civilian control of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The American military belongs to the American people. It
does not belong to the government. Today, the government has expanded the
doctrine of &igrave;civilian control of the military&icirc; in ways that
the Founders would have deemed abhorrent, and which common sense indicates
can only lead to catastrophe.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Founders desired civilian control of the military to forestall
military adventurism, foreign and domestic. But control was never meant
to entail government micromanagement and arbitrary interference in purely
military matters. The Congressional power to raise armies and maintain navies
did not imply that Congress should routinely substitute its opinions for
the professional judgment of the military on military matters. The president&iacute;s
role as commander-in-chief does not entitle him to command troops in the
field . . . or to supervise routine military matters and operations from
the comfort of the Oval Office. No one save the Supreme Court ever decreed
that the Court should intervene in military affairs. Civilian control meant,
and should mean, making sure that the military remains subordinate and responsive
to the will of the people (through the instrumentality of the government)
in its defense of the people. The government abuses its authority when it
forces the military to abdicate its professional expertise and values to
honor the whims and advance the fortunes of whoever happens to occupy the
White House or hold some position in Congress.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The institutional trend toward civilian micromanage-ment and
interference in purely military affairs began in 1947, with the establishment
of the Department of Defense, and creation of a secretary of defense whose
full-time job it was to manage services whose secretaries formerly reported
directly to the president. The trend intensified during the Kennedy and
Johnson years, when secretary Robert McNamara , who pointedly denied the
validity of military expertise &igrave;There is no more strategy, only crisis
management&icirc; &oacute; usurped many of the planning and budgetary powers
of the services, and began using the military for social engineering and
experimentation. Project 100,000, which forced the military to accept unqualified
entrants for service during the latter years of Vietnam, may indeed have
helped some unfortunate souls. For the military, it was at best a costly
and disruptive additional burden. Since then, the routine and often arbitrary
substitution of civilian for military judgment in purely military matters
has permeated the military and corrupted its functioning, its ethics, and
its morale.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Of course, the military of a democratic society must reflect,
to the extent possible, the core values of that society: equality, justice,
the value of the individual. But the military is also a unique profession,
engaged in a unique activity. The issue is balance, and the balance of one
era will differ from another. Today, the government is upsetting that balance
by advancing PC civilian agendas, just as surely as it upsets the balance
by buying pork-barrel weapons or maintaining useless bases while starving
essential programs. In this sense, the use of the military to advance PC
civilian agendas is part of the larger problem of the limits of governmental
interference in internal military affairs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the people</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>In the abstract, the requirements of the people have not
changed one iota since the Founders determined to provide for the common
defense. These include protection of people and territory; defense of vital
national interests; and the occasional use of military capabilities for
other purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But defense is not an abstraction. Forces are raised and maintained
to deal with specific threats in specific places at specific times. They
also exist to deal with the unexpected, the evolving, and the accidental.
They cannot, therefore, be artificially limited by bureaucratic or professional
preferences, or by constricted views of what a military should or should
not do. This is especially true in periods of rapid change.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, this does not mean that, in such periods, &igrave;anything
goes.&icirc; The present world and domestic situations are complex and in
some ways incoherent. Still, the lack of a clearly-defined mortal enemy
&oacute; an Axis or a Soviet Union &oacute; and the lack of a clear national
consensus on certain cultural and moral matters does not justify incoherence
or expedient military thinking. Nor should the blurring of previously distinct
boundaries between domestic law-enforcement and the military be used as
an excuse for avoiding serious consideration of why that blurring may be
necessary. The United States may have to live without a clear declaratory
strategy for some time to come, and with an increasingly unpalatable cultural
and social situation. But, in the long run, it cannot live without a clear
sense of the requirements of national survival and welfare.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Homeland Defense</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>First and foremost, the people require that the military defend
their lives, territory, and property against deadly attack. Today, this
means defense against weapons of mass destruction (WMD), whether a single
terrorist device or an accidental or limited launch by a hostile state or
subnational group. Sadly, it may also include defense against domestic terrorism/insurrection
that may have foreign support. Defense against WMD is no longer a nice-to-have
adjunct to conventional military capabilities. Nor does it become a law-enforcement
matter when such devices are assembled or brought into the United States,
rather than fired at it. Indeed, never before has the fundamental problem
of home defense seen such a confluence between foreign and domestic threats.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Militarily, the vital task is: How to locate little things
(Scud launchers, cruise missiles on yachts, suitcase bombs, anthrax canisters)
in big places (the Iraqi desert, Manhattan, the Pacific Ocean) and then
get the information to those who can do something about it before the detonation.
The military&iacute;s primary responsibility here is to develop and field
&igrave;multi-use&icirc; defenses and supporting systems that can protect
troops in the field, theater-level operations, and the homeland. For example,
Aegis-equipped naval vessels, originally designed to protect carrier battle
groups against massed air attack, can do picket duty off the coast of Saudi
Arabia . . . or Puget Sound. 747s equipped with anti-missile lasers can
deploy in defense of London or Long Beach. Countering small numbers of relatively
rudimentary weapons is far easier than the challenges faced during the Cold
War. Vital technologies are far more advanced. Only lack of political will
(and wisdom) prevent anti-WMD defenses from becoming reality.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The military&iacute;s second homeland responsibility entails
operating in that gray area between conventional war and law enforcement.
Here the military finds itself in an alliance of convenience with the civil
libertarians. Neither wants the military involved, the former for professional
and bureaucratic reasons, the latter for fear of constitutional trespass.
Both concerns are valid. But the military&iacute;s responsibility is to
defend the nation against the threats it faces, whether those threats be
&igrave;conventional&icirc; or not. And whatever else may be said of the
Bill of Rights, it is not a suicide pact. Military participation in two
counter-terrorism activities &ntilde; intelligence and armed response &ntilde;
must, of course, be carefully monitored and limited when it occurs within
the United States. But it must not be proscribed for fear that any military
involvement automatically and inevitably produces mass violations of civil
liberties, military dictatorship, or worse. The issue is balance, not a
spurious either/or.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third homeland responsibility is disaster relief after the
use of WMD. This mission should be entrusted to the National Guard, and
funded appropriately. The advantages are obvious. Guard units already know
the territory they&iacute;ll work in and routinely participate in non-terrorist
disaster relief. Since the active-duty military rarely needs this capability
in peacetime, assigning the mission to the Guard cuts the expenses by 50
percent or more. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Major conventional conflict</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Properly maintained and modernized, U.S. conventional forces
will remain by far the most capable on earth. Their primary function should
be to serve as a deterrent. Failing that, conventional forces should be
prepared to win, quickly if possible, but always decisively and with minimal
loss of life.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>These capabilities need not be linked to dubious concepts such
Therefore, to the maximum extent possible, ground power should reside in
the reserves and the National Guard. These forces cost considerably less
than full-time equivalents and can be made combat ready in less time than
&igrave;weekend warrior&icirc; folklore &ntilde; or the instinctive preferences
of the active establishment for active forces &oacute; would indicate. This
does not mean, of course, that reliance on reserves should be used to justify
excessive cuts in active structure. Simplistic formulas such as &igrave;all
heavy forces into the Guard&icirc; should be avoided. It does mean that
the bulk of the country&iacute;s land combat power should reside with the
people.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is true for another reason. Mobilization of the reserves
and Guard provides a crucial test of popular will and support, as the Persian
Gulf experience demonstrated. The war demonstrated this because, in the
aftermath of Vietnam, the Army structured itself so that it could not wage
protracted war without the reserves. That policy paid political as well
as military dividends. Further, in this era of power devolving from the
federal to state levels, the National Guard &oacute; a classic &igrave;multi-use
system&icirc; &oacute; should be strengthened.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Operations other than war and short of war</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The United States cannot be the world&iacute;s policeman. It
should not try to be the world&iacute;s social worker, therapist, or nanny.
There is more misery out there than America can ever hope to alleviate.
U.S. forces do not exist for these purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, a world in which aggression runs rampant, and in which
atrocity becomes standard media fare, is in nobody&iacute;s interest, save
that of aggressors and criminals. From time to time, humanitarian, peace-keeping,
or peace-enforcing operations may become desirable. The American people,
generous and humane, understand this. They also understand that such operations
rarely achieve their objectives. And those with experience in this area
know that such operations are costly, demanding, demoralizing, and distracting.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because of the uncertainty of the world situation, it is probably
unwise to rely on a checklist approach to decision-making. As a rule, commitment
to other-than war operations generally should be regarded with healthy skepticism
and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Further, belief in the value of &igrave;America&iacute;s
global leadership role&icirc; should not be used as justification for imprudent
engagement. &igrave;Showing our resolve to show our resolve&icirc; rarely
fools anyone for long. Further, every global problem is also a regional
and local problem, and best handled at those levels. Only when these fail,
or cannot succeed without U.S. support, should direct involvement become
an option. And if U.S. direct involvement is vital, it goes without saying
that no compelling reason exists to place U.S. forces under foreign command.
It also goes without saying that funding for such operations should not
come out of military appropriations, and that other nations should be encouraged
to contribute.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Beyond this, operations short of/other than war should make
maximum use of reserve and National Guard assets. This has been true since
Vietnam for certain capabilities, including air transport, medical, special
operations, and supply. Reserve and Guard use should be expanded to include
ground forces. Just as mobilization provides a de facto &igrave;people&iacute;s
veto&icirc; on entering major war, so does selective participation offer
a test of popular support for lesser contingencies.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>The requirements of the military</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>We now come to the most difficult issue: What are the obligations
of the American people to the military? Throughout most of this country&iacute;s
history, the answer has been, nothing. Properly speaking, there has never
been a covenant between people and military, certainly nothing on the Israeli
or Prussian models. There has been no need.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>American attitudes toward the military have always been conflicted.
Belief in military service as an obligation of citizenship coexisted with
a lively detestation of that obligation&iacute;s practical expression, the
draft. Admiration of the military as a profession &oacute; admiration for
qualities of courage, purpose, discipline, and devotion &oacute; still thrives,
but so does distaste for &igrave;lifers&icirc; and contempt for bureaucrats
in uniform. Traditionally, the military has enjoyed a higher status than
the well-publicized &igrave;detestation&icirc; of the left might suggest.
But this good will rarely has translated into direct support for the institution.
Americans have paid taxes, sent their sons and daughters, supported the
troops, and aided the veterans for centuries. The people have also benefited
the military by their innate caution regarding foreign involvements and
reluctance to accept heavy casualties. But the sense of obligation has been
attached to citizenship and to country, not to the military as such. Never
before have the American people been asked to defend their domestic political,
social, and cultural forces.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the American people have two new responsibilities
toward their defenders. The first is to insure adequate funding for development
and deployment of defense against WMD, and for modernization sufficient
to maintain the conventional deterrent (a modernization that should include
further downsizing and outsourcing of support functions and major restructuring
of combat forces). The second responsibility is to defend the defenders
against civilian PC agendas that produce significant erosion of military
capability, while the military evolves a new balance appropriate to its
needs and democratic values of equality and opportunity. It is often forgotten
that, when President Truman ordered the desegregation of the military, African
Americans were already present in force, and had proven themselves in two
world wars. The inclusion of women in non-support roles is an entirely different
matter; no civilization in history has ever tried it, save in extremis.
So are issues related to the inclusion of openly homosexual men.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>II. To contour the debate</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Since the 1970s, the U.S. military has been under implacable
assault by an array of radical feminist, gay-rights, and other forces who
regard the military as &igrave;key terrain&icirc; in the Culture War and
who appear willfully oblivious to, and sometimes delighted by, the damage
they do. But (to reiterate) only recently has conservatism recognized the
seriousness of the assault. The conservative strategy has been to reaffirm
the obvious: that the military exists to perform certain unique functions;
that its traditional values relate to its functions; and that whatever harms
the ability to perform those functions is unacceptable. This strategy is
not wrong. But, to those with agendas of their own, and to much of the public,
it is largely irrelevant.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In order to begin to correct this situation&oacute;in order
to defend the defenders successfully&oacute;it is necessary to reformulate
the issue, away from the scripted pseudo-exchanges of &igrave;rights versus
readiness,&icirc; toward forms resonant in the larger culture and society.
This can be done in two ways: first, by changing the structure of the debate
and, second, by presenting the military as symbolic of what&iacute;s been
happening in the country as a whole. Conservatives and concerned centrists
must not confine themselves to presenting the military as an institution
apart, the unique exception to the rules. The present crisis should be seen
as a metaphor for what happens when individual &igrave;rights,&icirc; sexuality,
and &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; come to negate, not only individual responsibilities,
but also common purposes.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Therefore, emphasize the following:</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The vast majority
of women and minorities in the military are not the enemy. The problem rather
comes from those self-appointed activists who presume to speak and act on
their behalf, while damaging the very institution to which these women and
minorities have dedicated themselves. Equality is here to stay, and equality
means equality of responsibility as well as equality of opportunity. Equality
of opportunity includes the chance for honest failure: There are things
not everyone can do, and honest failure is no disgrace. Equality of responsibility
does not, and cannot, mean sameness.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>There is no such
thing as a &igrave;right&icirc; to serve in the military. No one has it.
Nor is there any right to any particular job or security clearance. There
is no right to remain in the military, commensurate with civilian employment
protection. To define the military in terms of rights is to reduce it to
a vehicle for advancing the careers and agendas of individuals and pressure
groups. This is like saying that the purpose of a business is to benefit
its employees, with no reference to what that business is supposed to produce
or how it functions against the competition. Military necessity takes precedence
over manufactured individual &igrave;rights.&icirc;</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>But &igrave;military
necessity&icirc; is not an historical absolute. Once, military necessity
required corporal punishment and drumhead courts martial. Once, military
necessity seemed to require exclusion of African Americans. In the largest
sense, a democracy&iacute;s military must reflect its values. Today, these
values include an unprecedented degree of tolerance and willingness to experiment
with social arrangements. But even these values must, in the end, recognize
that reality imposes limits, in the military as in all other activities.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Zapf Dingbats">u</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>That said, sexuality
poses peculiar problems for the military. Sexuality, unlike race or ethnicity,
entails behavior. Sexual behaviors acquire special significance in an institution
as hierarchical as the military, and under conditions of extreme danger,
stress, and privation. The radical feminist agenda requires that heterosexual
males conform completely to their codes of behavior and thought, while demanding
nothing of women. The gay agenda demands total acceptance under any and
all conditions. One need not be either male chauvinist or homophobic to
ask what self-controls might be required of women and gays, especially under
extreme conditions. By the same token &oacute; and this is an issue that
conservatives have yet to address &oacute; it seems wrong to exclude entire
categories of persons from service, or from certain kinds of service, on
the basis of what they might do. It also seems wrong to legitimize the notion
of &igrave;behavioral minorities.&icirc; A more compelling approach would
be to emphasize that the responsibilities of women and gays toward the military
&oacute; indeed, toward the country &oacute; could conceivably include not
serving, or not serving in particular capacities.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And therein may lie a possible new balance, with &igrave;role
model&icirc; potential for the larger society. At a July 1996 Heritage Foundation
National Security Symposium, retired Army Col. William Hauser suggested
that the military should be deemed to have a central &igrave;core&icirc;
&ntilde; the combat arms &ntilde; which must be allowed to retain its traditional
values and exclusions. The non-combat portions of the military could adopt
far more liberal personnel policies. The PC left will no doubt object that
this violates their principles of &igrave;equality&icirc; as the only absolute,
and &igrave;equality&icirc; no matter what the real-world cost to other
people and to common purposes. Conservatives may emphasize negative effects
on readiness and object to the perceived surrender of principle. Still,
it seems a reasonable compromise: exclusion only when absolute military
necessity requires it, inclusion the rest of the time.</FONT> <BR>
<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5></FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>To bring about a new covenant between people and military,
two separate but related efforts are necessary. One is to emphasize that,
while the abstract responsibilities of the military have not changed, the
real-world situation is unprecedented. Old formulas, old divisions of labor,
no longer avail. The second is to emphasize that support of the military
can no longer be limited to paying taxes and waving flags. The defenders
need to know what they&iacute;re expected to defend, and that they will
be defended in turn. One effort should resemble that of the late 1970s and
early 80s in making public the need to rebuild America.s defenses &oacute;
a campaign that helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1980, and then aided his defense
program during the crucial first years. The other effort should resemble
that of the late 1980s and early 1990s, documenting and publicizing PC in
the military as it was exposed on campus. In purely military terms, the
goal should be to convert popular awareness into pressures for policy changes
that will bring about a new and livable balance. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>But, in the larger sense, the military disarray must be addressed
as part of the larger American crisis of values: specifically, of creating
a world of endless &igrave;rights&icirc; and demands, to the exclusion of
responsibilities and purposes, of elevating sexuality to the status of an
absolute, and of making &igrave;sensitivity&icirc; a legally actionable
standard of conduct. In this final sense, the goal should be to make the
struggle over the military the &igrave;beginning of the end&icirc; battle
of the Culture War &ntilde; to demonstrate both the limits of PC engineering
and the ability of the military to adapt to changing civilian values, and
thereby to suggest that reasonable compromise &ntilde; the way of democracy
&ntilde; can be attained, whether the PC crowd likes it or not.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>And, in the end, the debate over the proper composition and
uses of the military reveals one of the fundamental truths of civilized
life. If what unites us is more important than what divides us, we are friends;
we can work it out. If what divides us is more important than what unites
us, we are enemies; our relations will be determined by the exercise of
power. The uniting issue here is the survival and security of the United
States: a goal which can be achieved in many different ways. Only those
united in this matter should have standing in this debate.</FONT> <BR>

<P>&quot;Modern American life . . . is characterized by new communities
far more numerous and far less intense than those of earlier ages.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So wrote historian Daniel Boorstin more than 30 years ago. At the time,
he was speaking of &quot;consumption communities,&quot; and the notion that
those of similar lifestyle have more in common with each other than with
their geographical, religious, or ethnic compatriots.<BR>
<BR>
Concluded Boorstin:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The modern American is tied &shyp; by the thinnest of threads and
the most volatile, switchable loyalties &shyp; to thousands of other Americans
by nearly everything he eats or drinks, or wears, or reads. . . . We are
held to other men, not only by a few iron bonds, but by countless gossamer
webs tying together the trivia of our lives every day.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since then, several generations of social critics, researchers, and politicians
have made entire careers deploring the weakening, if not the outright demise,
of those few &quot;iron&quot; bonds of family, faith, community, country.
The Right, religious and non, touts the so-called traditional values that
made sense before the iron rusted. The Communitarians proffer an apolitical
return to the neighborhoods where you heard gossip about your sins on your
way back from (or to) committing them, albeit with a much-abbreviated catalogue
of sins. Most recently, political scientist Robert Putnam has decried the
&quot;Bowling Alone&quot; phenomenon: the decades-long decline in old-fashioned
voluntary group membership, and presumably therefore in sociability. And
nearly everybody, from the Christian Coalition to the Politics of Meaning
crowd, agree that this is a civilization of human beings seemingly unable
to relate to much of anything beyond the twitchings within their tummies,
their genitalia, and their skulls.<BR>
<BR>
Or maybe not.<BR>
<BR>
One of the most remarkable phenomena of the last few decades has been the
&quot;small groups&quot; movement &shyp; actually not a movement at all,
but the spontaneous rise of myriad little organizations, some <I>ad hoc</I>
and evanescent, others more permanent. Sociologist Robert Wuthnow estimates
that as many as 30 percent of all Americans may participate in such activities.
In his recent book, &quot;Sharing the Journey,&quot; he suggests that these
groups, which feature minimal levels of commitment, easy entry and exit,
and which usually concentrate on a single activity, are now a permanent
fixture of American life. A glance at the newspaper personal section will
reveal their extent: everything from Bible study to addiction recovery,
from confederations of space alien abductees to Adult Survivors of Fairly
Normal Parents. Many view these groups as little more than psychotherapeutic
and spiritual versions of Boorstin's &quot;consumption communities,&quot;
providing audiences for the empty and the self-obsessed. Wuthnow, while
acknowledging their limitations, sees them as valuable, provided they're
expected to augment, not replace, the older and larger assemblages.<BR>
<BR>
But maybe not.<BR>
<BR>
To understand the significance of the small group phenomenon, and the corresponding
decline in more permanent affiliations, it may be necessary to deep-six
two common sense notions: that small groups are trivial, and that the &quot;iron
bonds&quot; are natural. In fact, in a world of political and economic megastructures
and accelerating cultural globalization, these groups may provide a vital,
and perhaps a final, access to sanity. Perhaps they can help restore the
civility that civilization, by virtue of its scale and unnatural harshness,
takes away<BR>
<BR>
As a species, <I>homo sapiens </I>may be 100,000 to 300,000 years old. For
all but a few thousand of those years, <I>homo sapiens</I> lived in small
groups of hunter-gatherers. Evolutionary biology tells us that we are genetically
encoded for such an existence, that our genetic make-up has not changed
since the Neolithic Revolution which established sedentary civilization,
and that genetic coding includes behavioral repertoires as well as physiological
characteristics. Yes, humankind is the only species to evolve culturally.
But the fact remains: We are programmed to live in small groups.<BR>
<BR>
Yet we cannot. Even if we could, few of us would wish to return to such
a life, or endure the small group as the limit of physical survival and
social reality. &quot;Back to the Pleistocene&quot; is not an option. But,
in a world of seemingly endless impersonal and anonymous possibilities &shyp;
a world of people who often feel compelled to avail themselves of more possibilities
than might be good for them &shyp; some form of participation in small groups
makes genetic, and therefore psychological sense. The combination of right-size
and reasonable distance from others can be both therapeutic and civilizing:
indeed, more civilizing than life amid the megaliths and the masses which,
whatever their material contributions, have always been acknowledged as,
in so many other ways, dehumanizing. Small groups provide &quot;transient
stability&quot; in a world of civilized creation which inevitably gives
rise to decidedly uncivilized, and ofttimes savage behavior. <BR>
<BR>
But if this is true, or even plausible, an uneasy question arises. What
about loyalty? If conventional structures no longer command it, and if small
groups don't demand it, and if self-interest and survival no longer adhere
to anything in particular, what can hold civilization together? Will jogging
clubs and support groups, Republicans and Democrats, Star Trek conventions
and alternative Sunday schools, be enough? Can a world be maintained on
trivia?<BR>
Or would it even have to be?<BR>
<BR>
Archeology and anthropology show that small hunter-gatherer groups tend
toward the nonviolent. Their moral codes tend to be self-enforcing. Few
dare risk banishment from the group; few dare attack their sole source of
survival. Still, history shows that, ever since the species settled down
and opportunities for interactions with strangers began to increase, humans
have oppressed, tortured, and killed each other over different concepts
of what the &quot;iron bonds&quot; beyond the small group should be. Would
the spiritual and therapeutic hunter-gatherers of postmodern civilization
be willing to fight over the &quot;gossamer webs tying together the trivia
of our lives every day?&quot; It all depends, I guess, on what one considers
trivial.<BR>
<BR>
And on how many of them there are.<BR>

Has American Judaism lost its roots?</CENTER>

<BR>
Modern American spirituality is a lot like Interstate Five. Everybody seems
to be on it. Nearly everybody's changing lanes. The road signs are large
but not always helpful. Entry and exit can be tricky. If you drive long
enough you end up in Canada &shyp; decent and pleasant, though not often
inspiring. But if you drive long enough the other way, you find yourself
in . . . well, California.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, American Judaism took to the interstates. Specifically, the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), the major Reform organization,
began offering &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; outreach seminars, designed
for anyone with any kind of interest in the subject. Seattle was the 16th
city on the UAHC list. From March through May of this year, thirteen sessions
were conducted at area Reform temples.<BR>
<BR>
I became aware of the program through an ad in the EastsideWeek. <I>A  Three
Session </I>Journey &shyp; Come <I>Share</I>. The simple invitation accessed
some files I thought I'd deleted decades earlier. Not an entirely  pleasant
retrieval. Despite, or perhaps because of the discomfort, I made the phone
call. For the first time since 1973 (a bizarre Passover <I>seder</I> in
the Marines) I would enter a Jewish activity. Just to check up on the tribe,
I told myself. Just to see if  anything had changed.<BR>
<BR>
Nothing had. And, perhaps, everything. And, perhaps, much more than the
tribe was involved.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
To anyone over 40 with knowledge of the American Jewish experience &shyp;
my own background was Orthodox, intensely ethnic/Yiddish, and included yeshiva
time &shyp; the most striking aspect of the current situation is what's
no longer there. The old ethnicity: gone. This was, of course, inevitable.
The immigrant generations have passed, and with them their dialects, their
neighborhoods, their ways. And so have most of those who knew them well,
and who participated in American Jewry's version of the Eternal Triangle:
the three-generation struggle of immigrants, their conflicted, striving
children, and their affluent, baby-boomer-bratty grandkids to adapt and
succeed, yet  keep the faith available.<BR>
<BR>
Reform Judaism began in Europe two centuries ago as an avant-gardish, highly
intellectualized attempt to bring Judaism into the modern world, to offer
alternatives to the tradition-encrusted Orthodoxies of  the  ghetto and
the ghetto mentality. In the United States, Reform became a  pensive half-way
house for ambitious immigrant children, eager to shed their parents' ways
yet unwilling or unable to discard the old faith entirely. A Yiddish joke
tells of a conversation between an old Orthodox mother and her successful
Reform son. Do you still keep Kosher, Hymie? No, Mother. Do you still go
to <I>shul? </I>No, Mother. Do you date Jewish girls? No, Mother.<BR>
<BR>
So tell me, Hymie. Are you still circumcised?<BR>
<BR>
Beneath the humor, the anguish of  a past, no longer visible. Some one else's
war.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also, the Holocaust as an omnipresent, suffocating yet binding American
Jewish reality. The memory's been institutionalized and, to some extent,
denatured. It has to be to survive beyond the lives of those who knew it,
and of it, personally. There's the museum in Washington, D.C., its power
fittingly unspeakable. There's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and a healthy
academic and literary output. But the Holocaust  memory-as-solidarity is
different when the European branch of your family ended up in Auschwitz
and you learn the details from those who knew and mourn them. It's different
when the woman next door has a number on her arm that she neither conceals
nor talks about, and three houses up, the couple from Dachau  won't let
their kid out of their sight and on quiet nights you can hear their dream-screaming,
<I>Gangsters</I>! <I>Teuffeln!</I> and your street's more or less like the
rest of the neighborhood in this regard.<BR>
<BR>
Gone also: Israel &shyp; or, at least, the pre-1967, or pre-1982, or pre-1996
wide-eyed adoration and unquestioning support. &quot;Exodus,&quot; Leon
Uris' perennial seller about the creation of the Jewish state, used to be
dismissable as bad fiction. Now it's obscene.<BR>
<BR>
But, most of all, American Judaism no longer seems quite so special, American
Jews no longer quite so intriguing. Certainly, chunks of the old culture
have been mainstreamed. Jewish humor's everywhere; Yakov Smirnoff now works
The Nashville Network. There are probably more varieties of bagels in Seattle
than synagogues. But by the standards of the 1950s/1960s, when a confluence
of forces (Israel, the Holocaust, economic and intellectual success, the
waning of the more virulent anti-Semitisms) made Jews a fashionable minority,
it's over. And today, despite the well-hyped pronouncements of Mr. Farrakhan,
a few militia G-mo's, and some armed-and-ugly confrontations back east,
Jews don't get persecuted much anymore. Indeed, by the standards of the
1950s/1960s, most American Jews don't even seem all that interested in each
other, or themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Some years ago, the UAHC noticed this. Their sociological and statistical
researches showed that over half of all American Jews consider themselves
unaffiliated with any form of  organized Judaism. Over half of all Jews
now marry outside the faith. If present trends continue, American Jewry
could constitute less than one percent of the population within a couple
of decades.<BR>
<BR>
So the UAHC took the first step toward renaissance. They got a grant. Then
they put together &quot;A Taste of Judaism.&quot;  Kathryn Kahn, the national
program co-ordinator and assistant director of the UAHC's Commission on
Reform Jewish Outreach in New York, says that much of the material derived
from previous experiences working with lapsed Jews wandering home and interfaith
couples in which the Jewish partner wanted to cling to some part of the
tradition, but couldn't articulate why. &quot;A Taste of Judaism&quot; would
take it national.<BR>
<BR>
Says Kahn: &quot;We wanted to set up a barrier-free program. No cost. No
books. No homework. A minimal investment in time. We wanted to let Judaism
speak for itself. We started out with the three Jewish verities of God,
Torah, and Israel. But we felt that might be a little formidable, so we
changed it to Spirituality, Ethics, Community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Kahn, the program's success astonished even its creators. &quot;We
ran ads in secular publications. They weren't professionally done. People
said the ads just jumped off the page at them. Since 1994, we've had over
4000 people take the seminar. We're just starting to send out a major survey,
asking people at least six months out of the course, 'What Jewish choices
have you made?' We may never know the full impact. But we've had conversions,
temple joinings, many levels of response.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pam Waechter, the program's Seattle-area co-ordinator, says that the series
drew over 850 queries. 470 people took this year's offerings; there's a
waiting list for 1997. She adds that much of the interest here came from
adult children of interfaith marriages who'd been raised as Christians,
or in no tradition. <BR>
<BR>
So perhaps American Jews are still interested; all they need to re-up is
just some no-heavy-lifting spirituality. Or perhaps it's part of something
larger, a more general American returning to God and roots.<BR>
<BR>
In part, no doubt. But the most striking aspect of the &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot;
was that, within the context of Reform Judaism's oddly constricted view
of things, and beneath the back-to-faith patina, the class was doing something
of which it seemed utterly unaware. Of course, there was no way for them
to know that they were engaging in an ethical exercise of pagan origin which
could well provide the moral basis for 21st century American civilization,
Jewish, Christian, humanist, and a whole lot else.<BR>
<BR>
But first, let's  look at it the old-fashioned way.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Twenty-five people show up at Temple D'Hirsch Sinai on Pike Street. During
the obligatory self-introductions, more describe themselves as &quot;recovering
Catholics&quot; than wayward Jews. There's a cute little blonde who's pondering
conversion, some interfaith couples (one very pregnant), a Mercer Island
Episcopalian woman now dating a Jew, a black gentleman of the Ba'hai faith,
professing curiosity. A few others, Gentiles, mention curiosity; they either
 want to understand their Jewish friends, or have no Jewish friends but
want to understand, anyway. No one would mistake this crowd for refugees
from the club scene. They're older, serious, earnest.<BR>
<BR>
There's no strict curriculum. According to Kahn, the instructors were &quot;asked
to pick passages [from the Torah and other literature] that they feel passionate
about, and to talk on those.&quot; The temple provides the instructors:<BR>
<BR>
Associate Rabbi Beth Singer, one of those clergypersons who can't pronounce
her title without italicizing it and who, on ordination day, must have been
issued an inexhaustible supply of timed-release sincerity capsules. She'll
do Spirituality  (the session originally designated, &quot;God&quot;)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick, a retired public school teacher now working as the temple's
director of education. <I>(Gott i</I>n<I> Himme</I>l, he looks just like
my Uncle Milton). Chernick's the teacher everybody had once, if they were
lucky, the lively guy who humanized the course they dreaded taking. He was
also Chaucer's clerk in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; &shyp; &quot;Glad
would he teach, and gladly learn.&quot; He'll handle Ethics (formerly known
as &quot;Torah&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
Cantor Kenneth Koransky, a South African-emigre with an international reputation
and a passion for the people he sings for. He'll teach Community. Israel
receives mention as a place where Israelis do not follow the traditional
ways.<BR>
<BR>
The course is designed to entice people to Judaism,  not to confer advanced
degrees or conduct Talmudic disputations. But, almost immediately, two intellectual
weaknesses become apparent. One is an astonishing lack of basic knowledge
among the instructors, far in excess of the usual podium tongue-slippages.
One does not expect to hear from an ordained rabbi that King David built
the First Temple or that &quot;parts&quot; of the Hebrew Bible are found
in the Christian Old Testament. The class, properly more concerned with
impact than with trivia, says little about it. At one point in his session,
Koransky asks aloud why he keeps turning to me for answers, and muses that
I look like a rabbi, sent to spy on the proceedings. I'm not, I tell him.
I'm far worse. I'm a journalist.<BR>
<BR>
And don't mess with me, man. I been to<I> cheder</I>.<BR>
<BR>
The second flaw, and the second astonishment, concerns more substantive
matters. Reform has always tended toward a certain self-satisfied  parochialism:
part 19th century social gospel, part anachronistic New Deal liberalism,
part 60s time warp, with PC aplenty for spice. The positions, and the posturing,
hadn't changed one iota in thirty years.  The great sin of the Pharisees
&shyp; the  pride-in-goodness which even Jesus found incorrigible &shyp;
still resides among those who've done their best, for centuries, to distance
themselves from the Pharisees' putative descendants.<BR>
<BR>
Rabbi Singer leads off. She assures the room that she will be &quot;nonjudgmental&quot;
and &quot;noncoercive.&quot; She flits over a selection of quotations compiled
by a Rabbi Rossove of Temple Israel, Hollywood, CA. She tells the class
that Judaism is &quot;experiential,&quot; that you don't have to believe
in God to be a good Jew, as long as you feel it. She calls Orthodox Jews
&quot;fundamentalists&quot; &shyp; the first time I've ever heard one Jew
apply that inappropriate epithet to another. She asserts that, as far as
the old ways go, &quot;We take what makes sense to us and skip over the
rest.&quot; Some things &shyp; homosexuality and women, for example, &quot;they
just didn't understand the way we do.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Concludes Rabbi Singer: &quot;Sometimes I wish I could go through the Torah
with a bottle of White-Out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Then &shyp; wink/wink, giggle/giggle &shyp; &quot;Don't quote me on that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I decide to write. After class,  I identify myself to her as a journalist
and ask for a one-on-one follow-up interview to discuss her teachings. She
tells me how busy she is. A few weeks later, I leave another request on
her voice mail. Two days after, a woman from the temple calls. Rabbi Singer
wants to investigate my background before &quot;granting an interview.&quot;
The next day, another woman checks in. Rabbi Singer will be unable to schedule
anything, but I am authorized to write that she &quot;enjoyed teaching the
course.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reform seminaries, if they do not already do so, might consider offering
instruction in media relations.<BR>
<BR>
(Author's note: Before sending this article off into cyberspace, Rabbi Singer
received a third interview request. She did not respond.)<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick takes Ethics. He's excellent on expounding Jewish notions of
the sacralized life. You can sleep with your girl friend and it's not a
sin. But it's better if you do it married. You can eat your food without
a blessing, but it's better to say a little grace. No, you don't have to
believe in God, or in any particular conception of God, but we do insist
on monotheism and we do these things because God commands them.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming God exists.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick teaches with fervor that the essence of Jewish ethics is how
we treat each other, and how we work to bring on the Messianic Age that
may or may not require a physical Messiah.<I> Tikku</I>n<I> Ola</I>m. Repair
of the world. We must do this for the poor. We must do that for the environment.
I ask him if this ethic mandates any particular political ideology or action.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You bet it does. We don't have to get into the details here, but everybody
knows what they are. We have an obligation to insist that our government
reach where we can't. We have to be sure that our government is acting as
ethically as we are. If we're going to be holy, we have to use every venue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I don't respond that Jerry Falwell couldn't have put it any better. A few
days later, at lunch, I ask him to elaborate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, if caring about other people means you're a liberal, then I'm
a liberal. If not caring means you're a conservative . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Does caring require fealty to any particular bureaucracy or way of doing
things?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, obviously not . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
OK. This guy's sincere. In Jewish ethics, civility comes before scoring
points.<BR>
<BR>
Koransky, in class and on the phone later, proves the most challenging.
&quot;A Jew can eat a ham sandwich on Yom Kippur,&quot; he says, &quot;and
still be a Jew. Not a good Jew, but a Jew. You can disbelieve in God and
still be a Jew. But you can't be a Jew by yourself. Without the synagogue,
what does the Jew have?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
I ask him whether a Jew can acknowledge his identity and heritage and believe
in God, but not care for the company of his fellows.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Jewish self-hatred is an old thing. So is social-climbing. So is disagreement.
Once, two Jews were stranded on a desert island. A few years later, a ship
happened by and rescued them. One of their rescuers noticed that they'd
built three synagogues. He asked why. 'Well,' one of the Jews said. 'That's
the synagogue I attend. That's the synagogue he attends. And that's the
synagogue neither of us would be caught dead in.'<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The unaffiliated Jew,&quot; he concludes, &quot;just hasn't come home.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
No exceptions?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can't be a Jew in a vacuum.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
Still, there are vacuums and vacuums. Solitude is not the worst. Far more
vacuous (forgive the pun) is so much of what passes for modern American
religious questing &shyp; the endless shopping down at the spiritual supermall,
looking for just the right accessories for just the right spiritual life-style,
and for that perfect, nonjudgmental, noncoercive, get-the-White-Out deity.
 Seen in this sense, Reform Judaism's just one more boutique.<BR>
<BR>
Yet seen in another, exactly the opposite is true. Throughout this century,
the Orthodox Jewish rap against Reform was that they wanted to be Jews without
doing the hard Jewish work, indeed, to be Jews without being anything Jewish
in particular.  The yeshiva boys might drive you crazy, but at least you
knew where to find them. Reform wasn't Judaism. It was warm-and-fuzzy, feel-good
religion; it was an accommodation of convenience for life among the<I> goyim</I>.
In the end, to borrow a phrase, there was no &quot;there&quot; there.<BR>
<BR>
Irv Chernick disagrees vehemently. The people he deals with, especially
in his adult education classes, aren't dilettantes. They're determined to
find a way to make Judaism a real presence in their real lives. Their what
to leave in/what to leave out decisions are based on personal and family
needs, not fashion or whim. I got the same sense with the people in the
seminar &shyp; that the question on their minds was neither what's hot nor
what's not, but<I> How shall I liv</I>e?<BR>
<BR>
And therein lies the possible ethical future of this land.<BR>
<BR>
To explain:<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the only civilization in history to adopt, as its de
facto official value-system, &quot;How do I feel, especially about myself?&quot;
No other culture has ever elevated feeling &shyp; emotion beyond all external
validation or linkage to the outer world --  to the status of an absolute.
Most would have considered it insane. It doesn't work. The wreckage of the
attempt lies all about us: failed marriages and relationships, failed politics,
the culture of anarcho-banality, the endless immersion in the formulaic
pornographies of violated flesh and spirit.<BR>
<BR>
But for those who wish to move beyond the failed American psychobondage,
modern ethics offers only two alternatives, neither really workable. One
is submission to some external authority, technically known as the deontological
approach. What does the Pope say? What does the Torah say? What does the
Party say? How would Dan Quayle, or Hillary Clinton, handle this situation?
What would Arnold Schwarzenegger think of me?<BR>
<BR>
What is the law?<BR>
<BR>
Some folks need to submit. Others choose to do so, often in the belief that
they're returning to &quot;tradition.&quot; or doing it for the sake of
the kids, or just to structure their lives. But a multicultural, essentially
libertarian society doesn't have this option. As far as the rules go, one
size no longer fits all.<BR>
<BR>
The other modern ethical alternative is to live by trying to predict the
results of one's actions. But consequentialism doesn't work much better.
No one can know all the implications, or control all the results. Should
I marry Jack or Jill? If I give this street person money, will she use it
for food or drugs? At the political level, consequentialism leads from inept,
intrusive social engineering to the tyrannies of  &quot;the greatest good
for the greatest number.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there is a third alternative, slowly emerging from centuries of obscurity.
Its technical moniker is &quot;virtue-ethics&quot;.  It first regained general
notice in the 1970s, with the publication of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre's<I>
After Virtu</I>e. Since then, its most effective expositors have been classicists
and philosophers such as Martha Nussbaum <I> (The Therap</I>y<I> of Desire</I>)
 and Julia Anna<I>s (The Morality of Happiness)</I> &shyp; women writing
for a general audience, but also seeking  an ethic for women of the post-feminist
era. During the Vietnam War, virtue-ethics were practiced by the American
prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton. Admiral James Stockdale, who won the Medal
of Honor for his prison leadership and who once described himself as &quot;the
lawgiver of an autonomous colony of Americans who happened to be located
in a Hanoi prison,&quot; had studied virtue-ethics in graduate school. His
extensive writings on how he and his comrades adapted and applied them in
prison were totally ignored by the media during  and after Stockdale's painful
performance in the 1992 vice-presidential debates. (For the record: Jim
Stockdale introduced me to the field, first in his writings, then in a series
of personal conversations and letters in the 1980s. Everybody should have
the opportunity to get to know a great man or woman, at least once.)  <I>
</I><BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, the relevant question is neither &quot;What are the rules?&quot;
nor &quot;What are the consequences?&quot; It is certainly not, &quot;How
do I feel?&quot; Nor does it have much to do with the currently fashionable
&quot;Books of Virtues&quot; available in the bibliotherapy section of your
local bookstore. The vital question is &quot;How should I live?&quot; Rules,
emotions, consequences all matter, but only as guides. The North Vietnamese,
for example, did not want to torture their prisoners. They wanted information,
propaganda statements, help in breaking other prisoners. The torture decision
was American. Knowing full well that, in the torture room, they would ultimately
submit, they nonetheless decided that<I> their live</I>s required them to
take torture before surrender . . . and then to start the whole hideous
process again the next time.<BR>
<BR>
Virtue-ethics is a Hellenistic creation. It dominated the final centuries
of antiquity. It comes in many forms, among them the Aristotelian, Epicurean,
Stoic. It leaves many concepts vague. Virtue-ethics provides no answers
to the question it poses: How shall I live? It does offer ways of finding
answers.<BR>
<BR>
An Aristotelian might hold that virtue is the &quot;golden mean,&quot; that
midpoint between excess and defect in any character trait. Courage, for
example, would be the mean between cowardice and rashness. The wise woman
would then apply this trait to the situations of her life. An Epicurean
might hold that, since the world is a meaningless jumble of atoms and random
events, and since the gods either don't know we're around or else don't
give a damn, the wise person maximizes his or her own pleasure &shyp; but
only in ways that don't cause painful and anxious dependence on that pleasure.
 Curiously, the virtue-ethic most appropriate to a libertarian, multicultural
society &shyp; a society desperately trying to amend its materialistic,
planet-trashing ways &shyp; might well be an updated Stoicism.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism today connotes little more than heroism in the dentist's chair,
or taking the bad news in a certain way, on maybe Mr. Spock on the bridge
of the Enterprise. In reality, it's far more subtle.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism was founded in the third century, BC by Zeno, a native of Cyprus,
an  island with a large Jewish community. The doctrine received its name
from the Stoa, or colonnade in Athens, where he held forth. Its most famous
expositors were a Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and a Greek slave, Epictetus.
Stoicism, the most popular of the philosophies of late antiquity, filled
that half-millennium gap between the waning of the pagan gods and the rise
of Christianity. Many of its concepts were, in fact, taken into the new
faith. And many of its concepts have an oddly Jewish intinction.<BR>
<BR>
Stoicism holds that there is indeed deity in the universe. Most often that
deity is pantheistic, present throughout creation but with no separate existence.
Yet Stoicism also allows for other gods, capable of suffusing human affairs.
 Stoic cosmology bears an eerie likeness to the current Big Bang theory.
And the Stoic insistence that the universe is an inter-related whole, with
that condition conferring ineluctable responsibilities on humanity, anticipates
modern deep ecology by two thousand years.<BR>
<BR>
But what matters here is the Stoic answer to the question, &quot;How shall
I live?&quot; Stoicism doesn't say, &quot;Be rid of your feelings.&quot;
It does say, &quot;Don't let your feelings &shyp; especially certain kinds
of feelings &shyp; jerk you around.&quot; Stoicism holds that the only thing
we can truly call our own is our will (or, if you prefer, intellect or spirit).
All else is beyond our control, and therefore, in technical terms, &quot;indifferent.&quot;
But some indifferents are clearly to be preferred to others, because we
are creatures inextricably involved with our fellows,, with the environment,
with deity. What form those relationships take depends on chance and circumstance.
Stoicism, for example, would never say, &quot;Get married. Have kids.&quot;
It would say, &quot;Whatever you choose, you cannot escape the responsibilities
to yourself and others inherent in that choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Epictetus put it, &quot;Let whatever seems to you the best, be to you
an inviolable rule.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Or Marcus Aurelius, writing his own creed: &quot;The man who values a soul
that is rational and universal and social no longer cares for anything else,
but aims solely at keeping the temper of his own soul and all its activities
rational and social, and works together with his fellows to this end. .
. . I have a city and I have a country; as Marcus I have Rome, and as a
human being I have the universe; and consequently what is beneficial to
these communities is the sole good for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But only Epictetus could decide what was the inviolable rule for Epictetus,
and only Marcus could make the final decision in what Marcus would do about
it.      <BR>
<BR>
In this sense, Reform Judaism is a something of a Stoic virtue-ethic. God
remains vague. A Jew can accept anything from a personal deity to a suffusion
of the universe with ethical implications. Laws and traditions offer guidance
only, even if their origin is taken as divine. The sovereign individual
reasons, asks,<I> listen</I>s, and decides. And &shyp; a fundamental tenet
of nearly all virtue-based systems -- this sovereign deciding leads the
individual, in the end, to the conclusion that others, and community, and
planet, and deity, make legitimate claims.<BR>
<BR>
In virtue-ethics, you can't be  sovereign &shyp; or human &shyp; in a vacuum.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;Taste of Judaism&quot; people see themselves as participating
in, and encouraging, a return to tradition. Perhaps it would be more accurate
to say that they're returning to a blending of traditions. Or perhaps it
would be more accurate to say that all ages blend traditions, whether they
care it admit it or not. We live amid a mingling of strange gods. But then,
so did Abraham, and Moses, and Aristotle, and Jesus. As for virtue-ethics,
you don't have to be pagan to understand, or practice it.<BR>
<BR>
You also don't have to be Jewish.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Military as Metaphor</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>The United States defense establishment is approaching the verge
of open rebellion and internal collapse. If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, it
will probably happen in 1997. If Mr. Dole wins, it might take a little longer.
At this point, perhaps the only thing that can avert it is getting the American
people involved. The most pressing defense issue in this country is now
the need for a new covenant between the people and the military they support
with their treasure, their lives, and their blood.<BR>
<BR>
The revolt will begin over money. It no longer matters whose figures you
play with; the money to sustain and modernize the armed forces, in their
present configuration, simply isn't there. After the 1997-1999 projected
cuts, an additional twenty percent force reduction (personnel, weaponry,
readiness) may be inevitable. &quot;Rationing the poverty&quot; among the
services is no longer an option. Nor should it be, given the long-acknowledged
and long-ignored need to restructure for the 21st century.<BR>
<BR>
The rebellion could begin with a single service, reminiscent of the 1949
&quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; after cancellation of the &quot;supercarrier&quot;
that eventually evolved into the modern aircraft carrier. It could easily
erupt into open and vicious inter-service rivalry and turf battles, with
each service protecting its favored systems, and the roles and missions
that justify them. (One of the great technological truths of 20th century
warfare is that, while weapons systems have proliferated, effects have converged.
It is now possible to do things in many different ways: a fact studiously
ignored when it points to the need for major changes in service tasks.)
The revolt may also have an intense - and intensely public -- reserve aspect,
as the services attempt to siphon dollars to the active forces. However
it happens, it won't be pretty.<BR>
<BR>
The internal collapse will come about - indeed, it's already underway -
because of money, and because of the continuing subjection of the military
to civilian social and cultural agendas and experiments, and the continuing
refusal of the senior leadership to (as the beer commercial has it), &quot;know
when to say when,&quot; even at the cost of their careers.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Webb, decorated Marine veteran and former Navy secretary, made the point
loud and clear in his recent speech at the Naval Academy. But Jim Webb can't
do it alone. It's time for the American people to get loud and be clear
about what they expect from their military.<BR>
<BR>
A new covenant between people and military might sound something like this.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Listen up, Pentagon. You too, Commander-in-Chief (assuming that you
happen to be on active duty). You've got three primary missions. The first
is to defend We the People against that which threatens us the most. Currently,
that's weapons of mass destruction, especially small numbers of crude weapons
in the hands of small, crude nations and unlovely subnational groups. Deterrence
can't do it all. We expect to be defended, even if it means interfering
with some of your bureaucratic priorities. It's doable. Just do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your second task is to maintain conventional forces strong enough
to deter conventional aggressors, or whup them handily. This doesn't mean
large standing forces. It means restructuring to take maximum advantage
of U.S. technological superiority (especially in aerospace), and making
maximum use of the reserves and National Guard. Mobilizing the reserves
is We the People's de facto veto on going to war. If you don't have the
political support to invite us along, don't go.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Your third task is to conduct (from time to time) humanitarian and
short-of-war operations, such as Bosnia, also with maximum use of the Guard
and reserves. We don't want to be the world's policeman; we'd rather not
be the world's nanny, guru, or sociopolitical therapist. But sometimes we'll
need to use a little muscle, just to remind the planetary DINGOs (Disturbers
of International Good Order) that we're capable of it.<BR>
&quot;Now, regarding who serves, and how, and why.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Get two things straight. (And pay attention, federal government, because
we're demanding some major policy and legislative changes here.) First,
nobody has a right to serve. Second, nobody should be excluded from service
simply because somebody else doesn't like his, or her kind messing up the
club. As a society, we're dedicated to equality. But equality doesn't mean
sameness. And equality of opportunity includes the right to honest failure.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Minorities, women, and gays are in the military to stay. They should
have exactly the same rights, and be held to the same standards, as all
others in their positions. It's no disgrace for a woman not to be able to
fly an F-14; few people can. (By the same token, the Air Force has no need
of white male pilots; women and minorities can provide adequate numbers
and skill levels.) It's no disgrace for most women to be weaker than men.
But it is a disgrace for people to be recruited or promoted according to
quotas or &quot;guidelines.&quot; It is a danger for people to fly airplanes
they're not qualified to pilot. And it is preposterous when the Army, for
example, evaluates co-ed basic training on the basis of &quot;equality of
effort,&quot; not equality of results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are no gender-normed battlefields.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And speaking of battlefields, let's talk about sex. When homosexuality
is practiced within a unit, that unit becomes vulnerable to collapse. Ditto
heterosexuality. Sex within the same chain of command compromises that chain.
Sexual harassment is abhorrent. Zero tolerance. But the criterion for action
against offenders should be behavior, not gender or inclination It certainly
should not be unsubstantiated and anonymous allegations, the Tailhook Transgression
(guilty by virtue of just being there), or a single slip of the tongue,
no matter how boorish.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Finally, we're going to help you do all this in two ways. First, we'll
give you about a quarter-trillion a year to play with. More when you're
out there doin' it for fair. That should be enough, if you get your priorities
in order and use it right. Second, we're going to lessen the social and
cultural pressures upon you by severely limiting your vulnerability to lawsuits
from the civilian sector. Your minorities, your women, and your gays are,
by and large, competent and dedicated. But many of their self-styled civilian
defenders are more interested in scoring points - and wrecking institutions
- than in providing for the common defense. They impose their agendas on
you, whose reason for being is to defend us, not submit to their demands.
We want you to be free of endless predatory litigation and threat of litigation
while you're figuring out how to function in this post Cold War world and
this post racist, post patriarchal, post homophobic society that We the
People - fine People that we are - have become.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there is no reason to believe that, short of national emergency,
the American people will devote much thought to their military. They rarely
have before, and for that reason, many worry about the military becoming
a world too-apart. Yet perhaps the opposite is happening. In many ways,
the military has become a metaphor for the larger civilization - the loss
of purpose to peripheral concerns; the surrender to intimidation and expediency;
the vicious, wanton destruction of reputations, careers, and life. Why should
Americans think about the military now? Because it's like looking into a
mirror.<BR>
<BR>
Do we like what we see?

NEW AGE CHANNELLING FOR RIGHT-WING WONKS</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Dr. Philip Gold<BR>
Discovery Institute Senior Fellow</B></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Got a grant to write a culture book. Started reading New Age stuff (Know
Thy Enemy). Unbidden, the question arose: Can conservatives also recover
past lives? I asked a very liberal, very Buddhist lady friend. She replied
that conservatives could not recover past lives until they acquired present
ones. That made it personal. I decided to attempt Recovery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was a dark and stormy night. I sat on the porch with the necessary meditation
aids -- scotch 4 soda, good cigars, meat-based munchies, and a yellow legal
pad to record the results. Trees howled. Wind swayed back and forth. And
when I accessed my first prior life -- Betakh-Betakh, senior fellow _ King
Solomon's think tank, the Center for_ Proverbial Wisdom -- I knew that the
Foundation would soon be getting its money's worth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fourteen other lives were recovered that night. Names have been omitted
when unverifiable and *** indicates possible false recovery.<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	2)	&quot;St. Olga,&quot; nom de guerre of Bolshevik female

		After the Franco-Prussian War, Kost-Uberrun ruined his career by 				
demanding that the national anthem, &quot;Deutschland uber Alles,&quot;
be renamed, 			&quot;Eine Kleine Machtnusik.&quot; Chancellor Otto von Bismarzk
(after whom, it 				should be noted, the modern German highway system, the
Otto von, is 				named) had more sense. Kost-Uberrun later sat on commissions

<BR>
<BR>
10) 	Perpetua Mal, 14th century Tuscan fishwife, burned at the stake, amid
					general applause, for her disposition. Now the unofficial patron saint

<BR>
<BR>
11) 	Evil Merovingian restaurant critic, condemned to spend eternity practicing
his 		trade only in cities undergoing prolonged sieges..Sentence reduced
to eons of 			community service in 1986. Now wanders the globe in search
of bachelors 				needing help with their microwaves.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
12) 	Otto Partz.***<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
13) 	Billy Joe-Bob Thud, Confederate agent provocateur during American Civil
				War, assigned to organize Quaker terrorist underground. Only man on

14) 	Hiddekel Ben-Hikkup, cub reporter for the Tigris 4 Euphrates News-
				Necromancer. Assigned to cover the Tower of Babel (&quot;in case something
				breaks&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
15) 	Harold -- the man in all the 1950s soap operas, of whom the women always
			asked each other, &quot;Does Harold know?&quot; Also known as Harold
the Clueless, 			Harold the Confused, Harold the RecentlySeparated and Harold
the Newly-				Available. Later developed into Harold the Traumatized and
Harold the 				Sensitive. May have founded modern Men's movement. Whereabouts
				currently unknown. Report of demise eagerly anticipated by many.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
In sum, the Recovery was an unqualified success. Only problem is, the book's
getting impossible to write. Everybody has their ideas, wants their input,
needs to share. Except for Hiddekel, Perpetua, and Sir Hamilton. They just
edit.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Apollo Covenant beyond the Oscars</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>

<P><HR><BR>
     &quot;Apollo 13&quot; did well at the box-office last year. A few nights
ago, it garnered _______ Academy Awards, for ___________. (Or: A few nights
ago, it didn't do quite so well at the Academy Awards, going zero for seven.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The movie was a hit for three reasons. Two are obvious. The third pertains
to the national crisis of soul, although not in a comfortable manner. Because
of this discomfort (actually, more of an existential bad faith), the real
significance of the film remains only dimly and squirmily acknowledged.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Dramatically, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a natural: a fast-paced technothriller
about a business-as-usual moon mission that went terribly wrong, then heroically
right. It was also a natural because it happened to be true. Technothriller
fused with nostalgia, for those years of hope and aspiration before JFK
got his sex life deconstructed and the Cold War's end deprived us of the
folks who, alone of all the powers on earth, could determine whether we
were Ahead or Behind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     But in a larger sense, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is about civilization
itself, and what it takes to sustain it. Seen this way, the movie teaches
some lessons that this country and its politicians and pundits -- for all
the glib-and-gushy verbiage about &quot;restoring trust and civil society&quot;
-- still haven't taken to heart.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The U.S. space effort of those years was, in essence, a set of three
covenants. One was between the government and the people, in accordance
with the constitutional requirement to provide for the common defense and
promote the general welfare. The Apollo project went forward to acquire
knowledge and opportunities, and as part of the global confrontation with
the USSR. That the knowledge and opportunities never materialized, and that
the Cold War aspect now seems questionable, does not negate the constitutional
validity of the covenant. The state, on behalf the the people and with broad
popular support, did what was deemed necessary at the time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second covenant was between the state and the men and women of
the space program itself, to make possible and sustain their success. This
the government honored as long as convenient. In a sense, the space program
met the same fate as Vietnam: not defeat, but abandonment. Perhaps, had
the government honored its commitment to exploration more steadfastly, greater
benefits might have been derived.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      But the most important covenant here was between the men and women
in the civil society of the space program, mutually pledging, if not their
fortunes, certainly their lives and sacred honor in the common endeavor.
In the film, Tom Hanks (playing astronaut Jim Lovell) tells his wife about
the first moon landing: &quot;It wasn't a miracle. We just decided to go.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    But the Apollo Covenant would have been quixotic without three human
virtues, each developed to near-perfection by the covenantors.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
   The first is hard-earned competence. After astronaut Ken Mattingly aces
a surprise simulator emergency, he waves off the praise and asks to work
the problem again because his performance hadn't been perfect. Lovell's
response: &quot;Let's get it right.&quot; When Mattingly's last-minute replacement,
Jack Swigert, muffs a similar drill, crewmate Fred Haise exudes a contempt
that doesn't abate until Swigert's final-hours display of skill and endurance
in preparing the command module for re-entry. &quot;Way to go, Jack&quot;
-- followed by Swigert's stoic, silent, and eloquent acknowledgement of
a covenant kept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     Perhaps those who teach that self-esteem derives from psychobabble,
or that respect need not be earned, should include this film in their curricula.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The second virtue is trust. Not touchy-feely emotion, but confidence
based upon experience of each other's competence and character. When flight
director Gene Kranz receives the devastating recommendations that they must
shut down the fuel cells (thereby &quot;losing the moon&quot;) and later
must power down the lunar module-lifeboat, his resistance fades before his
reasoned trust. When Swigert doubts that Houston can concoct a re-entry
procedure, Lovell assures him that &quot;they've got half the Ph.Ds on the
planet working on it.&quot; But near the end, when the crew almost believes
they're doomed, Deke Slayton tells them that &quot;Ken Mattingly's in the
simulator.&quot; Lovell's face and voice radiate relief.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Ken's working on it . . .&quot; One man they know and trust, worth
more at that moment than half the Ph.Ds on the planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     The third virtue is courage, in Plato's definition: &quot;endurance
of the soul,&quot; in the face of both hardship and expediency. When Kranz
learns that President Nixon &quot;wants odds,&quot; presumably to prepare
for political damage control, Kranz replies: &quot;We're not losing those
men.&quot; When the &quot;Grumman guy&quot; starts hedging that his company
&quot;can't make any guarantees&quot; about the lunar lander's performance
in space,  Kranz first tries to stiffen him. &quot;I'm not interested in
what anything was designed to do. I'm interested in what it can do.&quot;
Later, he writes the guy off as beneath contempt. When he tells his flight
controllers, &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; he knows they understand
what he means, and they know he means it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
      Marilyn Lovell displays similar endurance, her circumstantial passivity
spiked by unwillingess to tolerate anything less than honesty from NASA
and her abhorrence of media ghoulishness. Indeed, among the Apollo convenantors,
those on the ground displayed endurance of the soul equal to those in the
space craft. It was fitting, if no doubt unintentional, that the film's
two nominations for acting excellence went to Ed Harris, who played Gene
Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan for her performance as Marilyn Lovell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     In sum, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was a morality play. Its moral: You can
have your civilization, your accomplishments, your greatness. But it isn't
free and it isn't safe and it isn't easy. And, unless you're committed to
doing what it takes, one day failure will become an option.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
     And then a fact.<BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>The awful case of Commander Stumpf</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><B><I>From the Seattle Times Friday, January 26, 1996<BR></I></B><H1><CENTER>UNWRITTEN LAWS GROUND <BR>STAR NAVY PILOT</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>By <BR><I>Philip Gold </I></CENTER></H3><HR><BR><BR>The Romans had a proverb. Of all our laws, some are written and some arenot. <BR><BR><BR>As is often the case with proverbs, their surface simplicity conceals deepertruths. In this instance, at least two. <BR><BR><BR>First, written law can't do it all. There must be other sources of valueand discipline and mercy: religion, morality, honor, tradition and commonsense. <BR><BR><BR>Second, these &quot;unwritten laws&quot; are just that - laws. They toocan become unjust, oppressive, insane. <BR><BR><BR>Latest American example: The case of Commander Robert E. Stumpf, UnitedStates Navy. The particulars concern his career. But his situation shouldbe a warning, a clear signal that the &quot;unwritten laws&quot; of thecivilian political processes are corrupting the military, just as they'vetainted politics. And the growing bipartisan support for Cmdr. Stumpf shouldalso be read as a sign. The American people are beginning to say, enough.Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf is, by all standard measurements, a man on the fast track to thestars. An accomplished fighter pilot, he flew with distinction in the GulfWar, commanded the Navy's elite Blue Angels precision flying team and enjoysa fine reputation within the service. The Navy selected him for promotionto captain in 1994; the Senate confirmed him. He was then selected for futureassignment as an aircraft carrier group commander, perhaps the most covetedflying job in the Navy. <BR><BR><BR>Now, what's wrong with this picture? For starters, three things: Cmdr. Stumpf'spresence at the notorious Tailhook '91 convention; a Navy clerical error,and the judgment of some people in very high places. Cmdr. <BR><BR><BR>Stumpf attended Tailhook under orders to receive an award for the squadronhe commanded. He flew there in an F/A-18, logged as a training mission -a totally acceptable practice, when such training missions have to be flownanyway and other forms of transportation are either inconvenient or costly.Cmdr. Stumpf was present in one of the &quot;hospitality suites&quot; andwitnessed a hired stripper's performance; tacky, but hardly illegal. Heleft and retired for the night before some reprehensible but consensualactivities took place. No assaults occurred in this particular suite. .<BR><BR><BR>Stumpf was later investigated by the Navy, along with everybody else sweptup in that botched inquisitorial frenzy. He was completely exonerated andreturned to duty. <BR><BR><BR>His second ordeal began a few months ago, after the Senate had confirmedthe promotion list on which his name appeared. Apparently, the Navy hadviolated Senate instructions to &quot;flag&quot; the name of anyone connectedwith Tailhook. The Navy informed the Senate Armed Services Committee ofthe error. It seems senatorial pique at having been &quot;deceived&quot;coincided with an anonymous phone-accusation campaign directed at the committee.Last October, apparently at a non-quorum meeting, the committee voted tooppose the promotion. The result was a letter so indicating to Navy SecretaryJohn Dalton, signed by committee chairman Strom Thurmond and ranking DemocratSam Nunn. The letter noted that, since, the full Senate had already acted,rescinding the promotion was the Navy's job. <BR><BR><BR>Secretary Dalton complied. <BR><BR><BR>As of this writing Cmdr. Stumpf has been informed neither of the &quot;accusation&quot;against him nor the identity of his &quot;accusers.&quot; He has been refusedpermission to meet with the committee, or to defend himself in writing.Mr. Dalton defends the reversal by citing the need to maintain the &quot;integrityof the process.&quot; Also as of this writing, the Navy is considering anew policy to let promotion boards view &quot;potentially adverse&quot;information on officers that would not be contained in an individual's officialfile - such as anonymous accusations. The Marines have already adopted thispolicy. <BR><BR><BR>Let's dispose of the obvious first. Tailhook was abhorrent. So was the Navy'sresponse. The guilty walked. The innocent bled. The service humiliated itselftwice over. <BR><BR><BR>Also obvious is the fact that the Navy needs to change its &quot;unwrittenlaws&quot; governing treatment of female service members, perhaps its attitudetoward women in general. However, the Navy and the Pentagon, need to startstanding up to the shrill minority of feminists for whom no sacrificialexpiation will ever be enough. How ironic it is that service women havemore in common with their male &quot;oppressors&quot; than with their anti-military&quot;defenders&quot; in The Sisterhood. And how sad it is that militarywomen now complain that they can't get the kind of counseling and mentoringthey need from their male superiors. The guys are afraid to be alone withthem. <BR><BR><BR>Now to the less obvious but vital fact. The handling of Cmdr. Stumpf's casereflects what is now the unwritten law of the United States. While the &quot;written&quot;legal system stands ready to excuse almost anything (remember O.J.?), theunwritten system is always ready to convict. Accusation now equates to guilt,perpetual guilt. Punishment is automatic and severe. And those who are persecutedbecome not deterrent examples of evil, but warnings to &quot;good people&quot;to stay away. <BR><BR><BR>Men and women are leaving the service in disgust, their numbers lost amidthe statistics of the personnel drawdown. Others, whose names will neverbe known, are simply refusing to enter. The same is happening in civilianpublic life. <BR><BR><BR>Who needs it? When a hero's career can be destroyed for simply being ina room where somebody else later did something; when a woman can lose aCabinet appointment because she didn't pay her nanny's Social Security;when a man can win a Supreme Court seat yet remain pilloried for life onthe basis of He Said/She Said, this is no longer a partisan issue. Thisis not the upholding of any moral standard remotely related to reality.This is a vicious, pharisaical, ex post facto, pseudo-moral McCarthyism,and worse. <BR><BR><BR>Cmdr. Stumpf should be the symbol around which can rally everyone - Democrat,Republican, civilian, military, male, female - who wants this way of doingthings stopped. <BR><BR>Let the inquisitions end here. <BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Philip Gold is director of defense and aerospace studiesat the Seattle-based Discovery Institute and a lecturer at Georgetown University.</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Home</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Psychobabble Rising</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H3><I>Insight magazine December 18, 1995<BR></I></H3><H1><CENTER>Psychobabble Rising, but we <I>Feel the Pain</I> </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I><A HREF="gold.html">Philip Gold </A></I></CENTER></H3><BR><HR>Bill and Hillary. The president who feels your pain. The presidentialpartner (n&eacute;e first lady) who informs you that you know your lifeis empty and touts the Politics of Meaning as therapy. The couple who consideropposition to their caring policies as mean-spirited, unfeeling and paranoid,and who take to the airwaves to instruct the republic on how to talk tothe kids about everything from cigarettes to the Oklahoma City bombing.<BR><BR><BR>Ever since the Clintons first entered our collective consciousness (andcollective unconscious?) both the pundits and the people have noted theirpenchant for psychologized discourse. Columnist Suzanne Fields recentlysuggested that Clinton seems to aspire to a role nowhere mentioned in theConstitution or other legislation: therapist-in-chief. Most Americans probablyhave not viewed this as anything to get paranoid, neurotic, obsessed orborderline-disordered about. After all, psychobabble is everywhere. <BR><BR><BR>And that's the problem. Psychobabble-the reduction of personal and politicaldiscourse to minimal psychologized vocabularies-is no passing fad. It is,instead, the culmination of a century-long process. And, in many ways, Clinton-aman who seems to have neither core nor anchor, and scant sensibility savefor his image of others' image of him-is an appropriate president for anation in the final stages of psychologized dysfunction. <BR><BR><HR><H3><CENTER>***Psychobabble-discourse in psychologized vocabularies-is nopassing fad.*** </CENTER></H3><HR>A little history tells a lot. <BR><BR><BR>A century or so ago, this country experienced a deep cultural crisis. Comfortableold spiritual verities were yielding to the domineering, irrefutable truthsof materialistic science. As the cities filled with the new middle classesof the corporate workforce and with millions of immigrants, once-stablesocial patterns and traditions deteriorated. America seemed destined tobecome a multicultural, amoral mess. Divorce rates were rising. Crime wasrampant. Not everybody read, or even worse, respected the same books. Allthe little issues seemed to combine into one big issue that no one couldquite define, let alone solve. <BR><BR><BR>Enter the shrinks. <BR><BR><BR>One of the salient characteristics of the so-called Progressive Era (roughlyTeddy Roosevelt to Woodrow Wilson) was the bipartisan deification of expertiseand the professionalization of just about every human activity that couldbe professionalized. Psychiatry was a profession, albeit a poorly regardedand remunerated one. Psychiatrists worked at the margins of medicine andsocial relevance, mostly in state and charitable mental hospitals and asylums.Meanwhile, in the ruts and grooves of academe, psychology was strugglingto establish itself as a separate and independent branch of human knowledge,i.e., as university departments with their own budgets and as an organizedbody of practitioners with lots of dull journals to read and pompous conventionsto attend. <BR><BR><BR>Both groups decided that respectability and affluence could be attainedby expanding their purview. Psychiatry, with a nudge or two from Freud andhis claque, decided that the whole world was sick and in need of its ministrations,whether it knew it or not. Ditto psychology, and that strange amalgam, psychotherapy,was born. <BR><BR><BR>(Scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as psychotherapy, onlya melange of competing theories and practices. Imagine a chemistry thatcontained 50 different definitions of a molecule.)<BR><BR><BR><BR>The therapists also decided that they could be of inestimable value by insertingthemselves and their notions into the workings of every aspect of the stateand on behalf of causes that appealed to them personally. So these new expertson the human spirit began peddling their wares everywhere they could findcustomers. <BR><BR><BR>And find them they did-in social work, the juvenile- and criminal-justicesystems, in education and the other disciplines, among the clergy, the literati,the artistes. Some worked out of universities; other found employment withthe government or the private sector, teaching corporations how to manufacturedocile workers and ardent consumers, helping the government hype its warsand policies and generally convincing the populace that theirs was the kingdomand the truth. <BR><BR><BR>By the 1950s, few Americans could find a mate, raise their kids, confronttheir troubles or know what to feel without seeking, or being affected by,these experts. In the 1960s, politics itself became psychologized-protestbecame a form of growth and fulfillment and the issue protested matteredless than the protest. Jimmy Carter probably was the first president whosemajor attractiveness was his therapeutic value. Feminism devolved into the-personal-is-politicalschtick of consciousness-raising and if-I-feel-oppressed-I-must-be. Nukeshad to go because they upset the kids. Welfare is good because it's caringand compassionate. Ecological legislation will help restore our global consciousnessand that is the primary goal, regardless of the real-world effects. <BR><BR><BR>Then came the talk shows. And the recovery books. And the &quot;abuse excuse&quot;in law. And the Clintons, who, like so many of their generational and politicalconfreres, insist on judging policies by their intent and not their results,and who attack their opponents' emotions, not their ideas. Thomas Sowellsees this as the fundamental characteristic-and perhaps weakness-of theliberal self-anointed. <BR><BR><BR>Psychologized discourse has been around for a century. It has had a centuryto prove that it can't deliver. It's not just that if heart surgeons hadthe same success rate as psychotherapists, they'd all be in prison. It'sthat a civilization in thrall to the psychological can't work. It createspeople who can conceive of themselves only as isolated units with the outerworld important only as a source of frustration or gratification. It createsa politics in which emotions become the goal, not the fuel. It makes rationaldiscourse impossible. <BR><BR><BR>And Bill Clinton represents the final stage of this deterioration. It isreported that, in his latest incarnation, he intends to campaign in 1996by portraying the Republicans as &quot;heartless.&quot; <BR><BR><BR>Democrat or Republican-do you like this form of governance? <BR><BR><BR>In your politics? In your courts? In your culture? In your private lives?And in your souls? <BR><P><CENTER><B><I>Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Seattle-based DiscoveryInstitute and a lecturer at Georgetown University. </I></B></CENTER><P><HR><H2><CENTER><A HREF="1995view.html">Discovery Views</A><BR><A HREF="journal.html">Discovery Journals<BR></A><A HREF="inquiry.html">Discovery Inquiry</A></CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><BR><IMG SRC="discoimg.gif" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="93" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Discovery Homee</A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Gold Inquiry</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H2></H2><H2><CENTER>1995 Discovery Inquiry Vol. III, #1</CENTER></H2><H2><HR></H2><H1><CENTER><BR>What does a 21st century defense require?</CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Philip Gold</I></CENTER></H3><BR><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Americans favor a strong defense. But a nation can bestrong in the wrong ways. Since the 1994 election, there has been a growingdebate over the condition of the American military. Unfortunately, it isthe wrong debate, leading to the wrong conclusion-that America's defenseproblems can be solved by money alone. In reality, the present defense establishmentis an Industrial Age organization struggling to adapt to two new worlds:that of the post-Cold War disorder and that of the microchip. This year,the American people will devote well over a quarter-trillion dollars tothis increasingly obsolescent military structure. Because of mistakes duringthe post-Cold War builddown, some small selective, short-term increaseswill be necessary. But in the long run, the proper course is not to spendmore. The proper course is to spend smarter. This Discovery Inquiry offersa conceptual tool for thinking about such change. </I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><H4>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </H4><BR><BR>The current debate over national defense exhibits a curious sterility. Onthe surface, much of it involves the impassioned swapping of clich&eacute;s.Yes, we will always need somebody with a rifle on the ground; yes, aircraftcarriers can do things land-based aviation can't; yes, land-based airpowercan do things carriers can't; yes, redundancy of capabilities is important.Such statements have a &quot;true but not very helpful&quot; quality, sincethey say nothing about the proper mix of forces, or how to prepare and employthem. And, rather often, the clich&eacute;-mongers turn out to be thosewith special interests to protect. <BR><BR><BR>Beneath the bromides, the debate centers on two issues. One is readiness:real and perceived current inadequacies and the perhaps imminent dangerof a hollow force, unable to accomplish its missions, due to lack of training,equipment, and supply. The other is the capability of the current force,even if fully prepared, to handle the two &quot;nearly simultaneous majorregional conflicts&quot; posited as the strategic baseline in the Clintonadministration's Bottom-Up Review. <BR><BR><BR>So far, much of this debate has been an exercise in bean-counting, i.e.,quantitative assessments of how many billions spent, how many ships, divisions,and planes available, how many training days missed. These dry statisticsare often counterpointed by what might be termed &quot;analysis-by-anecdote&quot;-amelange of uncritically collected and repeated horror stories. <BR><BR><BR>The problem with this approach is twofold. First, readiness, like education,is a difficult condition to quantify. Statistics are easily manipulated,and readiness itself means nothing without asking: &quot;Readiness for what?&quot;For example, not everybody goes to war at once. If a division requires onemonth to prepare for deployment, but transportation won't be available forthree, high readiness is actually wasteful. Further, the services are stilldownsizing; it makes no sense to lavish resources on units slated for abolition.Many of the readiness horror stories appear to come out of lower-priorityunits. <BR><BR><BR>But more importantly, indices of readiness say nothing about what kindsof forces the U.S. ought to have. The analogy may be extreme but, in 1939,the Poles had the most ready cavalry in Europe. It is true that, short-term,the present force must be maintained at adequate, perhaps unprecedentedlyhigh levels. And, in fact, there is evidence that shortages have begun toaffect higher-priority units. But it is also true that the current forceis simply too large to be maintained at such readiness on any politicallyconceivable peacetime budget. Thus, the very attempt to maintain too largea force actually decreases overall readiness. A smaller force, differentlystructured and postured, is the logical alternative. <BR><BR><BR>Not surprisingly, the same bean-counting mentality that decrees the presentforce unready also calls for larger forces if the strategic requirementsof the Bottom-Up Review-the Clinton administration's conventional defensestrategy-are to be met. But the fundamental problem with the Bottom-Up Reviewis not that the forces available are inadequate. The problem with the Bottom-UpReview is that it's conceptually inadequate, and should be treated as such.<BR><BR><BR>The Bottom-Up Review posits the need to win two more-or-less simultaneousconflicts, presumably one in the Persian Gulf and one in Korea. The rationaleis that, should the U.S. find itself immersed in one war, another regionalpredator might be tempted to take advantage of the fact and start a second.Whether this might happen is speculative, at best. Less speculative is thefact that such a situation would be a national emergency unparalleled sincePearl Harbor (especially if an Iranian-Iraqi alliance ever materializes).Yet the Bottom-Up Review counts only active forces. In a two-front, perhapsa two-continent war, early and massive reserve mobilization would be unavoidable.<BR><BR><BR>Further, the Review accepts-indeed, effectively mandates-an operationalconcept guaranteed to produce maximum U.S. casualties and minimum results.In both wars, the U.S. would permit the aggressor to strike cross-borderfirst. U.S. forces would then &quot;stabilize the front,&quot; await reinforcements,counterattack and restore the status quo ante. Some of these forces, mostnotably heavy bombers and Marines, would &quot;swing&quot; between warsin a process lasting several months. This &quot;wait-get-hit-stabilize-reinforce-and-restore&quot;approach, itself a legacy of NATO planning for a Soviet invasion, workedin Desert Shield/Desert Storm largely because of Saddam Hussein's acquiescence.It must be doubted that the U.S. will ever again find so breathtakinglyco-operative an adversary. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, the Bottom-Up Review is far from the first U.S. strategy to sufferfrom a bad case of what is known at the Pentagon as the &quot;plans/realitymismatch.&quot; In the 1960s, Mr. McNamara and his Whiz Kids produced the&quot;2 1/2 War Strategy&quot;-simultaneous combat with the Soviets, theCommunist Chinese, and somebody else in a little war somewhere. (That 1/2war turned out to be Vietnam, which nearly wrecked the defense establishment.)Under Nixon, it became the &quot;1 1/2 War Strategy.&quot; During the Carteradministration, a &quot;Swing Strategy&quot;-moving hollow forces from warto war-enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame, and, mercifully, zero momentsof employment. <BR><BR><BR>In this sense, the Bottom-Up Review is not much different from its predecessors,and proof once again of General Eisenhower's dictum that &quot;Planningis essential; plans are useless.&quot; Or perhaps the Bottom-Up Review shouldbe regarded as merely a particularly inept transitional document, somethingto stick in the drawer until the world situation clarifies. But it mightnot be a bad idea if that drawer were to remain empty for a while. If theUnited States cannot currently produce a serious military strategy, perhapsit makes more sense to concentrate on the resources first. Then, with thattask underway, it might be useful to rewrite the brochure. <BR><H4>FORCE STRUCTURE, ROLES AND MISSIONS </H4><BR><BR>The military capabilities of any defense establishment are embedded in itsforce structure. Creating this structure is both art and science. Structuringentails an endless series of decisions and trade-offs: what to leave in,what to leave out, how to achieve the necessary combat synergies. Forcestructure is everything from how many divisions in the Army (and whetherdivisions are still a useful kind of organization) to how many riflemenin a squad and who will carry the grenade launchers and machine guns; howmany ships in the fleet and of what types; how many heavy bombers and whatkinds of munitions they will carry. <BR><BR><BR>Theoretically, and usually in practice, a nation's force structure is determinedby its geographical position and strategic needs. Historically, for mostnations, necessity requires that one service or form of power dominate;the others support. In the 20th century, for example, Germany and Russiawere land powers. Both got into serious strategic and economic trouble whenthey started acquiring navies they didn't need, but that threatened maritimepowers. Conversely, Great Britain was primarily a naval power; extendedland combat in two world wars devastated the country. Israel is a land power,although its situation dictates a very strong Air Force. Other countries-NorthVietnam comes to mind-succeed with little besides ground forces. <BR><BR><BR>Further, a country's force structure will be determined by whether its warsare fought at or close to home, or far away. Expeditionary forces cost muchmore than equivalent territorial forces, since they require sea and airlift,resupply, and, often, foreign basing. Expeditionary forces also tend tobe professional and available for duties short of all-out war. Often, theiruse does not signal long-term commitment. Territorial forces, on the otherhand, are often filled by conscripts, and-in the democracies-usually limitedto home defense or foreign wars fully supported by the population. <BR><BR><BR>But America's strategic needs are unique, and its military exhibits characteristicsof both territorial and expeditionary forces. <BR><BR>U.S. forces are, virtually by definition, expeditionary. They are also professional.But they operate under the severe political limitations characteristic ofdemocracies, not the least of which is the requirement that victory be rapidand relatively bloodless. U.S. force structure is also unique. No nationhas ever amassed the same mix: the normal array of land, sea, and air capabilitiesplus: <UL><LI>a fleet of large-deck aircraft carriers <LI>the world's largest Marine Corps <LI>long-range stealthy bombers <LI>an incomparable C3I (command, control, communications, intelligence)capability. </UL><BR><BR>America's mix of normal and unique, territorial and expeditionary capabilitieshas evolved throughout the 20th century. However, for a variety of reasons-fromchanging threats to technological revolutions and the popular insistenceon short, perhaps impossibly &quot;clean&quot; wars-the present structureis no longer adequate. The mix must change. <BR><BR><BR>Prior to the First World War, things were simple. If it happened on land,the Army tended to it; the Navy pursued its activities at sea. There were,of course, a few overlaps. The Army maintained coastal fortifications andartillery. The Navy might occasionally bombard a shore or land small partiesof Marines. But neither service could do, or take, the other's job. <BR><BR><BR>The airplane blurred this tidy division of labor. So did the mixing andmatching of hitherto unrelated systems. In World War II, carrier aviationroutinely struck ground targets. Land-based planes could take on fleets,provide convoy protection, etc. Simultaneously, a plethora of new capabilitiesdeveloped: armor, paratroops, submarines, large-scale amphibious forces,and strategic bombers, to name a few. Later came helicopters, missile-firingsubmarines, and the precision-guidance revolution. <BR><BR><BR><I>The result is that today, while military technologies and systems haveproliferated, their effects have converged</I>. It is now possible to fightin many different ways. For example, it used to be axiomatic that the bestanti-tank weapon was another (preferably larger) tank. But today, thereare easily over twenty different ways to destroy tanks: other tanks, infantryanti-armor weapons, special artillery munitions, helicopter gunships, attackaircraft, various mines. Conceivably, in a few years, submarines will beable to fire cruise missiles carrying anti-tank submunitions, each guidedto its target by internal sensors or by satellites. When ships underwaterfight tanks well-inland with the aid of systems in space, clearly, the conductof war could use some sustained rethinking. <BR><BR><BR>But there is another aspect to this proliferation and convergence of technologiesand systems. Capabilities that once were unique or clearly complementarycan begin to seem redundant, especially in an era of nebulous threats andconstrained resources. For example, once aircraft carriers and Marines couldgo where land-based aircraft and paratroop couldn't; ships had longer rangesand more staying power than planes, and that was that. They still do, butsuch staying power may not always be a relevant characteristic. Today, AirForce heavy bombers operating from only three bases (in the United States,Guam, and on Diego Garcia) can strike anywhere on earth within eighteenhours of alert. Paratroops out of North Carolina can reach, say, Beirut,faster than Marines steaming through Gibraltar. Thus, there are now at leasttwo ways to perform long-distance &quot;get-in-and-get-out&quot; air andground operations. <BR><BR><BR>This is not to say, of course, that carriers and Marines are obsolete. Farfrom it: Each service still possesses unique core competencies. Nor is itto suggest that redundancy is undesirable; in war, redundancy is vital.But it is to suggest that the current structure and mix of forces can bereconfigured to make maximum use of this new array of capabilities in anaffordable manner-even if this involves some alteration of each service'straditional roles and missions. <BR><BR><BR>From time to time, the Pentagon's internal struggle over roles and missions(technically, roles, missions, and functions) enters public consciousness.The subject can seem arcane. In reality, though, it's as simple as it issignificant. Imagine a theater company. Its mission is to stage &quot;Hamlet.&quot;To do this, it requires an on-stage cast. Each member plays a role. Somemay play, or prepare to play, more than one. Finally, the troupe needs alarge number of supporting functions: lights, tickets, PR, etc. <BR><BR><BR>At the highest military levels, joint and unified commanders (the GeneralSchwarzkopfs) receive missions. They draw their cast of characters and supportingspecialists from the individual services and from the larger defense establishment.Obviously, the needs of the combatant commands should determine what theservices purchase and train for. Indeed, the unified commanders and thePentagon's Joint Resources Oversight Council have achieved significant influenceover the process. But the individual services still write their own budgets,in accordance with roles and requirements carved into law decades ago. Andthe legal and bureaucratic history of this assignment process has been,in large measure, the history of making sure that the services get whatthey want. <BR><BR><BR>But today, the problem is how to make the new array of capabilities relevantto the myriad challenges of the 21st century. And one of the great hindrancesto a new force structure is the old division of labor. <BR><BR><BR>What follows is not so much a detailed list of recommendations for reallocationof roles, missions, and functions as it is a way of thinking about suchreallocations. <BR><BR><BR>To repeat: The problem is not money. This country can defend itself on abit less than three hundred billion dollars a year. But the establishmentmust be restructured. Less-of-the-same no longer avails. <BR><BR><BR>And neither does more-of-the-same. <BR><H4>GUIDING CONCEPTS FOR A NEW DEFENSE</H4><BR><BR>The following points provide a conceptual framework for restructuring defense.Full implementation would probably require changes to Title 10, USC, andto Department of Defense Directive 5100.1, the basic legal and tasking documents.For present purposes, such specific changes need not be addressed. <OL><LI><B>1) We're in an asymmetrical arms race. </B>It is obvious that thepost-Cold War world offers a variety of threats, from heavily armed aggressorstates to terrorist splinter groups. Less obvious is the fact that thereis an arms race going on-an historically unique arms race, in that it isthoroughly asymmetrical. The United States is, for practical purposes, outof the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) business. Development and productionof precision-guidance weapons and systems are now primary. Meanwhile, theplanetary predators develop or purchase nuclear, chemical, and/or biologicalweapons, along with crude but serviceable delivery systems. Thus, the fundamentaltask is to make U.S. power effective against both conventional forces andweapons of mass destruction. <LI><B>2) Culture constrains combat.</B> The American people, for reasonsranging from innate decency to media hype and hysteria, will not acceptprotracted land combat or heavy casualties. This means that, politicallyas well as militarily, it is vital to deter aggression or, failing that,to win rapidly and decisively. This is especially true because future aggressorsmay well try to create conditions in which the United States deters itselffrom responding to aggression. This can be done by initiating conflict inwhich protracted fighting and heavy casualties will be inevitable, or bystriking so quickly and successfully that response becomes pointless orcounterproductive. To avoid these situations, conventional deterrence mustbe overwhelmingly credible. Should deterrence fail, the rapid use of overwhelmingforce will be imperative. <LI><B>3) The U.S. is an aerospace power</B>. This overwhelming force hasa special character. Militarily, the United States is neither a land nora sea power, as these terms have traditionally been understood. The U.S.neither defends its territory against invasion nor covets the lands of others;there are few pieces of real estate anywhere for which this country wouldfight. Nor is there an enemy fleet to seek out and destroy, or sea lanesmenaced by raiders. The United States is, instead, an aerospace power: thefirst and only one in history. Aerospace power, in all its aspects, is thegreat American comparative advantage. Aerospace does not mean exclusively,or even primarily, &quot;Air Force.&quot; It centers on the Air Force, butalso includes naval aviation, Army capabilities, and-of great importance-precision-guidedweaponry and C3I systems. True, aerospace power will not be relevant toevery situation. But, since it is the great U.S. advantage, and since theAmerican people abhor bloody ground combat, as a general rule: Whatevercan be done from the air, probably should be done from the air. <LI><B>4) Aerospace forces come first.</B> It is time to recognize thatthe precision-guidance revolution, coupled with long-range and stealthydelivery platforms (submarines as well as aircraft) has the potential tochange the nature of conventional combat. For millennia, it has seemed axiomaticthat, since people live on land, wars must ultimately be settled on land,i.e., by the taking and holding of territory. However, as Clausewitz pointedout, war is a political act, intended to compel the enemy to do our will.In any given situation, territory may be a vital element of victory; itmay also be irrelevant. Terrorist groups or rogue states may or may notpossess territorial ambitions. Still, it has remained taken-for-grantedthat, in conventional war, the land campaign must be the centerpiece. Allelse supports the ground war. <BR>But in Desert Storm, land combat didn't win the war. Land combat finishedit. In the future, presidents and commanders may wish to repeat the DesertStorm sequence: a devastating air war followed by a relatively easy groundcampaign. Alternatively, they may decide, or be forced to decide, that theland campaign must be central. But they should have the aerospace option.This means that the Air Force's unique capabilities-global range, stealth,advanced precision weaponry-should not be tied, doctrinally or operationally,to the ground campaign. It also means that the air components of the otherservices should be kept strong and employed creatively within their ownrealms. <BR><BR><LI><B>5) Force structure must reflect reality.</B> From this it followsthat U.S. structuring priorities should be:<BR><BR>  <UL>  <LI>Aerospace power in its many aspects   <LI>Rapid response Marine and Army forces possessing substantial combatpower. This includes a Marine Corps of about 175,000 and a selection ofArmy paratroop, air-mobile, and light infantry units at battalion/ brigadelevel, plus other (Ranger, Special Forces, etc.) units.   <LI>Heavier Army units at brigade/division/light corps level capable ofrapid deployment and employment.   </UL></OL><BR><BR>For the Army, this entails both continuation of a post-Vietnam trend anda radical rethinking. In the 1970s, the Defense Department chose, for budgetaryand political reasons, to adopt and seriously implement the &quot;TotalForce Policy,&quot; declaring the reserves equal to the regular forces forplanning and employment purposes. This meant, among other things, that theArmy couldn't engage in protracted war without reserve mobilization. TheArmy wisely accepted this policy, recognizing that reserve mobilizationprovided a crucial test of popular support and national commitment. In the1990s, this policy should be pursued with renewed vigor. <I>Militarily aswell as politically, the capability to wage sustained ground warfare shouldreside with the people</I>. Today, the Army is a force of over a million,when reserve and National Guard units are counted: certainly an adequatenumber, if properly structured and prepared. <BR><BR><BR>Two principles follow. First, if a threat is not worth mobilizing the reservesto counter, or if the reserves can't be mobilized for political reasons,it's probably not wise to get into a major war. And, second, If large unitscan't be ready to fight in a very few weeks, they probably belong in thereserves. <BR><BR><BR>As a practical matter, this means that the Army must reconsider the natureof its larger active-force units. The old division and corps structure,with its many layers of command and staff, and its ponderous logistical&quot;tail&quot; may well be obsolete; future forces might better be a flexiblemix of brigades tailored into light corps, with reduced staffs and supportunits. <BR><BR><BR>Of course, not every active unit, regardless of size, can be ready all thetime. But large unready active units are a waste of money. The Army is themost labor-intensive of the services, and there are significant cost savingsin cutting personnel. Since World War II, the Army has been structured forexpansion as well as for immediate employment. World War II demonstratedthat, while a lieutenant or a private might be turned out in a few months,competent senior officers and non-commissioned officers took many yearsto develop. In effect, the Army stockpiled these people on active duty againstsome future mobilization requirement, finding them employment in bloatedstaffs, unnecessary organizations, and endless schools. But the days ofIndustrial Age warfare-of protracted mass mobilization-are gone. The activeArmy needs to downsize even more, modernize, and capitalize. And, in fact,the Army is moving toward these goals in a variety of experimental programs,although there is a certain reluctance to admit it too openly. This trendshould continue. <OL><LI><B>6) Structure determines spending priorities.</B> Defense spendingshould accord with these priorities. And, for the next few years, one ofthe top priorities should be acquisition of ample precision-guided munitionsand supporting systems, plus stockpiling of critical parts in the eventof a &quot;surge&quot; production requirement. The United States is indeedan aerospace power, but that doesn't mean that, just because something haswings, the Pentagon has to buy it. There must be rational trade-offs betweenplatforms and munitions. </OL><BR>The best example here is the B-2 stealth bomber. At over $800 million percopy for the 20 already on order, and at $20,000 per hour to operate, theplane is simply too expensive. Nor are next-generation fighter and attackaircraft an urgent priority; upgraded current models will serve for thenext few years. True, sometime after 2000, new aircraft will be required,and development should proceed aggressively. Air superiority is not a God-givenAmerican right; it must be maintained. But, for the next few years, themunitions will be more important than the platforms that launch them. Whenthe price of a B-2 bomber is also the cost of more than 800 Tomahawk cruisemissiles, for the Navy and the Air Force, the correct choice is obvious.<BR><BR><BR>Other high priorities include aggressive development of next generationsystems and ample funding for the Army's experimental programs. R&amp;Dis future readiness; it should not be sacrificed to maintain the presentforce at the present size. A final priority: airlift and fast sealift. Themost powerful military on earth is useless if it can't get to the war, orsustain itself once there. <BR><OL><LI><B>7) Presence and peacekeeping options expand</B>. In recent years,two activities short-of-war have consumed enormous resources. One is theso-called &quot;presence mission,&quot; i.e., keeping combat-ready forcesin and around various global hot spots. The most effective presence is,obviously, permanently overseas-based, combat-capable forces. But, for betteror worse, U.S. forces are coming home. The next-best presence forces aredeployed aircraft carrier battle groups and Marine amphibious ready groups;these units are mobile, operate in international waters, and have significantcombat power and sustainability. They are also vital during the transitionfrom crisis to war, and as the &quot;enabling&quot; force that permits theArmy and Air Force to get ashore. But they are also expensive, and presencemay now be defined as more than the up-close-and-personal. </OL><BR><BR>To the extent that presence is a condition in the mind of would-be aggressors-theknowledge that the stealth fighters and bombers and the Tomahawk-firingsubmarines and the paratroops are also out there-these capabilities mayaugment, and sometimes replace, more traditional forces. It's not a perfecttrade-off, but one that is both available and reasonable. The trade-offcan also lead to the conclusion that the constant deployment of carrierbattle groups may no longer be necessary in certain areas. The Navy hasrecognized this for years. Its efforts and experiments in &quot;adaptiveforce packaging&quot;-sending out presence forces without the large-deckcarriers-should continue. Marine amphibious carriers and surface ships armedwith precision-guided weaponry may not be as powerful or versatile as thebig-deck battle groups, but the option is valuable. <BR><BR><BR>The other major short-of-war activity consists of peace-keeping and humanitarianoperations. These are expensive, exhausting, and demoralizing. They alsowreak havoc with operating schedules and tempos, especially when a crisiserupts and the Joint Chiefs call on whatever units might be available. Aspecial Army peacekeeping division might not be a bad idea; if established,it should not count against Army end strength, or be funded out of Armyappropriations. <BR><OL><LI><B>8) Home defense belongs in the structure.</B> Finally, defense, likecharity, begins at home. Although the United States is not vulnerable toinvasion, it is entirely open to attack by weapons of mass destruction.Too often, the debate over continental defense comes down to a spuriouseither/or. &quot;Why build defenses when bombs can be smuggled in?&quot;and equivalent arguments. But it's not either/or. And, in fact, many ofthe battlefield and theater weapons now coming into the hands of potentialpredators could be used against the continental United States. Launchinga crude cruise or ballistic missile from a yacht or merchant ship on thehigh seas may well be easier than assembling and emplacing so-called &quot;suitcasebombs.&quot; These weapons can now be targeted with the aid of commerciallyavailable satellite navigation systems. </OL><BR><BR>And the United States is not alone in facing this problem. Many other nationshave a vital interest in defense against limited attacks. Russia, especially.It is therefore imperative that the United States begin a serious home defenseprogram, based upon maximum use of available and developing battlefieldand theater defenses, and in concert with other nations, whenever possible.What will it cost? Less, no doubt, than someday pondering the crater whereManhattan once stood, or the million bloated corpses that used to be thegood people of Puget Sound. <BR><H3>Conclusion </H3><BR><BR>The preceding has dealt with the conceptual framework for defense restructuringin a transitional era. Today, there is no defining threat. There is, however,a defining opportunity, created by changing technologies and world politics.These require a new force structure. But unnecessary defense spending is,domestically as well as internationally, a clear and present danger. Evenduring the coldest days of the Cold War, President Eisenhower could warnthat it was possible to spend too much on defense, and to spend it wrongly.His admonition is still apt. <BR><BR><BR><HR><H4>Dr. Philip Gold is a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute, and directorof the Institute's Aerospace 2010 Project.

Any American currently earning $10,000 per year pays $23.85 a week, or $1,240
a year, into Social Security.  If invested at market rates, at the retirement
age of 65, that investment would make anyone a millionaire (before inflation).
 That is the conclusion of Sam Beard, Chairman of the National Development
Council, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow, and author of Restoring Hope
in America: The Social Security Solution, to be published by ICS Press of
San Francisco in May.  Beard, who has worked for four U.S. Presidents, has
been investigating Social Security and exploring ways that all Americans
can be secure in retirement.  <BR>
<BR>
He begins a national book tour in Seattle at a Discovery program on May
14, 1996 at Kane Hall (Room 220) on the University of Washington campus.
 Co-sponsored by the UW Graduate School of Public Affairs and the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, the program begins at 7:00 p.m. and is free to Discovery
members; $5.00 for non-members.  Students will be admitted for free.  <BR>

<PRE>
What have been the effects of the current Congress on the state of the environment? Specifically, what
changes has the new Congress considered in the statutory base of the Environmental Protection Agency? What
effects do the differences in Eastern vs. Western approaches to environmental legislation have on this
important issue?

These and other issues are addressed by William D. Ruckelshaus, former head of the EPA at an April 23,
1996 Discovery Institute luncheon. Currently Chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, Ruckelshaus recently
testified before the U.S. Congress on retooling the EPA statutory base to promote industry flexibility and
creativity while continuing to protect the environment. The luncheon is at the Four Seasons Olympic Metropole Room from Noon to 1:30 p.m. 

Cost for Discovery members is $40; non-members $45. Tables of ten are available for $400. Preregistration
is required, and prepayment is due by April 19, 1996. Please use the Event Order Form on the back page, or

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law &amp; Policy Forum housed on Discovery website</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>

The tremendous growth of the Internet over the past few years has brought a host of issues to the fore. Those
of immediate concern include security, intellectual property, digital records management and access,
jurisdiction, taxation, privacy, electronic payments and transactions, and the resolution of Internet disputes.
Attempts by governmental bodies to resolve these issues have resulted in rulings that are inconsistent and
unsatisfactory to the vast majority of Internet users.

To resolve current and future issues of importance to the international community of users, the Internet Law
Task Force (ILTF) was created at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium held in Seattle last year. After
months of deliberations, the Internet Law and Policy Forum has been created. A non-governmental, global
organization, it is based for the interim at Discovery Institute. The goal of the Forum will be to achieve a
secure Internet, facilitate Internet communications in an atmosphere of self-regulation, and achieve the
harmonization of Internet law and policy at a global level, according to Albert Gidari, Discovery Senior
Fellow and one of the organization's founders.

<PRE>
This redesign of Discovery Journal is a sign of the Institute's move &quot;to the next level&quot; of activity and maturity. 
Board members, friends, and other advisors all urged us to make a prompt and brisk leap ahead. It is happening
this year.


We have enlisted for the first time an Executive Director and are setting out to hire a professional development
officer. The redesign of publications will extend to our other publications: Inquiry, our white paper series, and
Views, our compilation of Discovery Fellows' articles. Thanks to the generosity of the M.J. Murdock
Charitable Trust and our corporate sponsors, we have built a well-received interactive Internet website and are
creating a new computer network for staff and Fellows. 


Financial planning, staff functions, and events development are all being reorganized. There are several new
projects--and Fellows--to be announced soon. Having been the grateful guests of the Perkins Coie law firm
for nearly six years, we also expect to move soon into new, more capacious offices. 
Discovery Institute's purpose is clearer than ever: to move beyond today's public policy problems to discover
tomorrow's opportunities. We look for the big idea. And for practical ways to make it happen. Guiding our
big ideas (such as the freedom model of high technology, exploring life after materialism, common sense
environmental law, revolutionizing Social Security, and overhauling the adversarial legal system) are the
principles of personal responsibility, civic virtue, free market economics, internationalism, and representative
democracy.


Discovery Institute has always stood for this purpose and these principles. Only now we are trying to move
ahead a bit bolder and faster. 


We appreciate your joining us on the journey.


All the best,
Bruce Chapman</PRE>

<PRE>
Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder continues to be widely-published and sought after for his thoughts
on the future of high technology and telecommunications. Gilder's &quot;Telecosm&quot; series is featured in each issue of the highly influential Forbes ASAP magazine. His work
was the subject of a lengthy cover story in the March 1996 issue of Wired magazine. In addition, his theories
were the focal point for a piece in the January 1996 issue of the same magazine.

Frequently testifying before the U.S. Congress, <A HREF="ggtstmny2.html">(read Gilder's April testimony)</A> Gilder will next appear in April before the Senate Commerce
Committee on the need for change in spectrum allocation policy and the future of the FCC. In late March,
Gilder will premiere an eight hour multimedia presentation on the technological future, developed at Discovery
recently. The first showings: a conference of 1,000 business executives in Brazil, followed by presentations
in Japan and Italy. In addition to his work on high technology, Gilder has written a number of notable articles recently on other
subjects: on the immigration debate (&quot;Geniuses from Abroad&quot;) in the Wall Street Journal, and on welfare
reform (&quot;How Welfare Seduced Sam Brewer&quot;) in the February 1996 Reader's Digest. </PRE>
<H3>Program Notes</H3>
<PRE>Frank Gregorsky, former chief assistant to Rep. Newt Gingrich and a Discovery Fellow, will move to Seattle
this Spring. He is currently completing his latest work editing the recent speeches and presentations of George
Gilder.

<H3>George Washington Fellows</H3>
<PRE>Discovery Institute's annual <A HREF="religion.html">George Washington Fellows Program</A> will be held this Summer from July 15 to
August 11, 1996. An intensive four-week seminar on religion and politics for upper-level undergraduates and
first-year graduate students, the program is designed to give Fellows an in-depth understanding of the role
religion can play in a free society.

In addition to regular classroom discussion sessions, there will be a number of special forums on specific issues
led by nationally-recognized scholars and thinkers. Past forums have been led by George Gilder, George
Weigel, Edwin Meese, and Program Fellows Stephen Meyer and Edward Larson.

Questions or requests for information should be directed to Dr. John West at Discovery Institute. Applications
may be obtained by calling 287-3144. The deadline for applications is April 26.


</PRE>
<H3>Upcoming conference</H3>
<PRE>The Religion, Liberty, and Civic Life Program will also sponsor a one-day conference on &quot;Faith and Politics&quot;
on August 10, 1996 at Seattle Pacific University. The proceedings from last Summer's conference, &quot;The Death
of Materialism,&quot; have recently been published as a special issue of The Intercollegiate Review. More
information on this year's conference may be found in the June issue of the Journal.


</PRE>
<H3>Book publication</H3>
<PRE>The University Press of Kansas will publish <I><A HREF="preface.html">The Politics of Revelation and Reason: Religion and Civic Life
in the New Nation</A></I>, the new work by Discovery Fellow John West. 

Described by noted historian Mark A. Noll as &quot;a fresh, well researched, and extremely well-balanced account
of religious-political connections in the early republic,&quot; the book by the Director of Discovery's Religion,
Liberty, and Civic Life Program will be released in May.  Though West's book focuses primarily on the past rather than the present, he thinks it holds many lessons for
today. 

&quot;The more I studied the early years of our nation,&quot; says West, &quot;the more I realized that present controversies
are simply a continuation of arguments that have been going on from the start. There is a tremendous amount
we can learn from how religion became involved in politics in early America. The issues may be different,
but the principles are the same.&quot;

Discovery members wishing to place prepublication orders for the book should call the Institute at 287-3144.

</I>Carl Jung Meets Newt Gingrich</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <A HREF="gorsky.html">Frank Gregosrky</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="warn-stripe-1.gif" WIDTH="774" HEIGHT="8" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>No one who ever worked with Newt Gingrich has a complete picture of him.
In fact, the only man to portray him fully died over 30 years ago -- and
the two never met. This essay comes as close as anything will to bringing
them together.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Back in April 1983, Newt told his D.C. staff: &quot;There are consistencies
of pattern but not consistencies of process. You can't predict from day
to day what I'll do, but you can predict from day to day what, in a general
way, I'll be doing.&quot; In those days, he struggled to be heard and heeded.
He assumed his staff could maximize his reach, if only they understood his
method. He thought his GOP colleagues could seize the House, if only they
would implement his latest 25 projects. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Newt explained himself blue, while they -- most staff, many allies --
ran themselves ragged. Eventually, many of us just ran. Even when we could
finally &quot;do what he wanted,&quot; he suddenly no longer wanted it.
Becoming GOP Whip finally put some order into Newt's daily operations, and
the Speakership may complete the process. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet my guess is that his hyper-creative entrepreneurial nature will regularly
override the new post's structure and scheduling. If so, Newt's associates
still require a yardstick, a divining rod, to truly &quot;understand&quot;
him. I have one, and I'll tell you where to obtain it. But first, savor
its best parts, in bold, followed by a comment or two on each.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>[His] morality is governed neither by thinking nor by feeling; he has
his own characteristic morality, which consists in a loyalty to his vision
and voluntary submission to its authority. </B>Much like Bill Gates creating
Microsoft or Andy Grove guiding Intel, Newt Gingrich obeys his vision. Unlike
them, he is used to flying solo. As he told a senior staff group in September
1982: &quot;I only have coherently explainable positions when I'm forced
to stop and develop them.&quot; Otherwise he keeps piling intuition atop
intuition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The stronger his intuition, the more his ego becomes fused with all the
possibilities he envisions. He brings his vision to life, he presents it
convincingly and with dramatic fire -- he embodies it, so to speak. But
this is not play-acting, it is a kind of fate. </B>Yes, Newt has &quot;known&quot;
since teendom how he was fated to shape and lead a transformed Republican
Party. Ego may help power such a person's overarching goal, but it is never
the determining motivation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>He seizes on new subjects with great intensity, sometimes with extraordinary
enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-bloodedly, without any compunction
and apparently without remembering them, as soon as their range is known
and no further developments can be divined.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B>Anyone in Washington ever put in charge of a &quot;Newt project&quot;
will nod at this passage's correctness. As Newt said in 1983: &quot;I don't
do by planning, I plan by doing.&quot; It's a workable formula for a creative
individual surrounded by acolytes, but tends to cause chaos in a growing
structure run by colleagues who need to trust the central figure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that he has always
just reached a final turning point, and that from now on he can think and
feel nothing else</B>. Anyone who has just heard the latest of several Gingrich
presentations will concur. Newt acts and talks as if it's a total departure,
when usually it's a 5-10% modification. Though amusing to insiders, this
relentless enthusiasm keeps his talks immune to the cynicism lurking in
every Washington job. More importantly, it facilitates national recruiting.
(Cynics sometimes get to wage war, but only charisma can raise an army.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The intuitive is never to be found in the world of accepted reality values,
but he has a keen nose for anything new and in the making. Because he is
always seeking out new possibilities, stable conditions suffocate him.</B>
And this is why Gingrich, even as Speaker, will be a revolutionary. He could
not manager the status quo, making deals for the sake of comity, even if
he wanted to. This forecast has little to do with conservative ideology,
and everything to do with the type of leader and movement-personality he
is fated to be.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And what type is that? An Extroverted Intuitor. My hidden source tells the
complete story -- on pages 222-25 of The Portable Jung, a 1986 Viking paperback
edited by the late Joseph Campbell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the visionary psychologist Carl Jung never met the brilliant
partisan Newt Gingrich. Yet every single line in the pages I cite appears
to apply. (They come from his 1923 work Psychological Types, which 20 years
later was used to design the first of the Myers-Briggs evaluations.) With
such a tool, why rely on insider gossip and ideological tracts? Carl Jung
long ago wrote Newt's basic script. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Since his intuition is concerned with externals and with ferreting out
their possibilities, he readily turns to professions in which he can exploit
these capacities to the full. Many business tycoons, entrepreneurs, speculators,
stockbrokers, politicians etc. belong to this type.<BR>
<BR>
</B>For a striking case study, explained by a guru Gingrich also likes,
consult Peter Drucker's 1983 essay on Thomas Watson Sr., whose vision drove
IBM beyond time clocks and keypunch machines: &quot;Watson saw and understood
the computer 15 years before the term was even coined. He knew right away
that it had to be radically different from a high-speed calculator. And
he did not rest until his engineers had built&quot; the SSEC in 1947, which
was the first machine &quot;to combine electronic computation with stored
programs, with its own computer language, and with the capacity to handle
its instructions as data.&quot; (See chapter 33 in The Frontiers Of Management.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Technologies then came in response to Watson's leaps of information-age
insight. Similarly, <BR>
the Republican-run House now taking shape will fill in gaps envisioned by
Gingrich's intuitions of 20 years ago. Politics needs its entrepreneurs,
too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Final Jung sampler: <B>Such a type is uncommonly important both economically
and culturally. If his intentions are good, i.e. if his attitude is not
too egocentric, he can render exceptional service as the initiator or promoter
of new enterprises. He is the natural champion of all minorities with a
future.<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
Doesn't that final line clinch my case? House Republicans finally have a
future, Newt's intentions are good, and he has enough independently elected
peers to head off dangerous lurches -- all of which makes the prognosis
excellent: American governance is embarking upon a five or 10-year stretch
that, at least on domestic reform, will make Reagan's best years seem like
a sloppy rehearsal. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before I left his payroll, Newt advised the staff to read up on
Churchill. In one of the Manchester books, I found this description of him
at age 4l: &quot;He is a wonderful creature, with a curious dash of schoolboy
simplicity and what someone said of genius -- 'a zigzag streak of lightning
in the brain.'&quot; So said Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, sounding like
Bob Michel appraising his own successor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this city, reading Winston Churchill is more common than studying Carl
Jung texts. But, if you seek to confirm a the new Speaker's &quot;consistencies
of pattern if not of process,&quot; Jung's piece, written 20 years before
Newt was born, offers the only direct path. It will help us &quot;predict
from day to day what, in a general way, he'll be doing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I needed Doctor Jung's description a dozen years ago, but didn't know where
to look. Now you do. After you read it, you might say a prayer for the current
generation of Gingrich aides. Why? It goes back to the point Drucker made
about Watson: &quot;Because visionaries cannot explain to the rest of us
what they see, they have to depend on command.&quot; <BR>

<P>Just by going about their highly difficult business, President Clinton
and Speaker Gingrich have been redefining campaigns and coalition-management.
Out of improvisation and intuition, they are trying things that might --
I would say should -- become a model for elected officials generally.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone knows how a politician in search of power goes about making commitments,
implicit or explicit, to his or her natural constituencies, in the hopes
that all of them add up to a majority on election day. When the commitment-making
is blatant (Walter Mondale in 1984) or merely clumsy (George Bush in 1992),
the candidate is assaulted by the other party for &quot;pandering.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So far, so normal. But consider what signals are sent to the profession:
All candidates, from their first race on, are conditioned to see the commitment
game as a tightrope to be walked. Don't lean too far either way. Don't seem
aloof, but neither should you appear overobligated. Be loyal to your &quot;base&quot;
-- without becoming &quot;owned&quot; by these same voters' lobby groups.
Keep your options open in Washington -- but beware winding up with no one
who will fight to re-elect you at home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most voters see through the above balancing act, and many politicians become
exhausted by it -- that's the bad news. The good news is that Messrs. Clinton
and Gingrich -- fellow baby-boomers and master orators who imagine they
can convince anyone of anything -- have been developing a new set of tools
for riding herd on to their respective partisan coalitions. I call it transactional
leadership -- a sort of &quot;share the risk&quot; public deal-making that
emulates the norms of private life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider a typical marriage in trouble. The husband is silent, morose, and
sick of being asked to share his feelings. The wife has therefore taken
to overstressing hers, and becoming both more needy and more bitter. One
public couple -- Michael and Kitty Dukakis -- played out this mirror-imagery
in the late 1980s. He was the rock, she was the hailstorm -- but, under
presidential-campaign pressure, each tendency made the other worse. Like
political forces, the two &quot;parties&quot; in a marriage can get dug
in at extremes that end up shriveling their union's productive &quot;center.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now consider a partnership, perhaps in real estate or law. Office footage
is being cut in half, so is the client-base, and the next year looks to
be a long dark trough. The partners can dig in and make demands, or they
can reach out and enlist this crisis of survival for some kind of longer-term
win/win. The partners could all commit to go six months without salary,
plowing all new revenue into (a) paying the unavoidable bills and (b) advertising
and other business-development. In short, share the risk -- and prove your
staying power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What the marriage crisis needs is this: &quot;I'll take the risk of reforming
if you take a risk and make some of your own needed changes. We will suffer
differently, but together, and in a hopeful direction.&quot; The business
example is one of going back to &quot;sweat equity,&quot; as if the partners
are starting the enterprise from scratch, by taking a blood oath to recapitalize
and build for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ask yourself: Does anything like that ever happen in the public phase
of politics? Forget the backstage favor-swapping and vote-trading among
individual legislators -- I'm talking about a top political figure proposing
a public transaction, to part of his electoral coalition, so a political
risk can be shared on the way to eliminating it. Technically this is not
a straight &quot;deal,&quot; but more of a negotiation begun while everyone
watches. The leader says: I'm willing to take the heat [for the group this
audience represents] on an unpopular vote. And I expect you to change your
act, and image, over the next two years so we don't have to bleed again
in the next Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of all national leaders, Newt Gingrich is the only one I see doing this
with gusto. I first witnessed it as his deputy press-secretary in September
1978, when President Jimmy Carter and a heavily Democratic 96th Congress
were pushing national price controls on hospitals. All the Georgia medical
groups expected Newt, about to win the first election, to fight his home-state
President's bill. And he said he would -- but he also told the Atlanta AMA,
point-blank, that they faced ultimate NATIONALIZATION if they stuck with
business-as-usual and ignored middle-class fears about profiteering and
bureaucracies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was great: A candidate telling his own supporters they can count on him
only so far. And beyond that? Get real, folks. Get serious about your own
survival in a democracy where the debate never stops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen years later, during the first version of his famed &quot;Renewal&quot;
course, Gingrich did something similar. He told both the FDA and the AMA
-- the latter still an ally, the former a growing &quot;enemy&quot; -- to
work toward reform according to the same unifying principle. Listen to how
Newt phrases it:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Guess what, gang? An awful lot of what the<B> </B>AMA is about is
a medieval guild: It is setting up government required rules that only if
you go through THIS school, pass THIS board, and are accepted by THIS group,
will we certify you. Now I don't think we should say, 'You want to do brain
surgery like Jethro on<I> The Beverly Hillbillies,</I> show up Tuesday...'
There ARE things you want certified; [but] I do think -- whether it's hospitals,
drugs, doctors or the Food &amp; Drug Administration -- there is a lot of
potential FLEXIBILITY in delivering things, and we need more pragmatism
and less credentials.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus spoke Newt, in November 1993, at Kennesaw State. The very same month,
to a quite different audience but one vital to his survival, Bill Clinton
also talked candidly. In Memphis, after a dazzling account of Martin Luther
King, middle-class black progress and urban mayhem, the President told a
vast assembly of black ministers: &quot;We have to make a partnership --
all the government agencies, all the business folks. But where there are
no families, where there is no order, where there is no hope, where we are
reducing the size of armed services because we have won the Cold War, who
will be there to give structure, discipline, and love to these children.
You must do that and we must help you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that moment, Clinton was leading the coalition that passed NAFTA. He
had just surprised Republican free-traders by enlisting most of the large
environmental groups. A re-elected George Bush could never have brought
these groups into the free-trade fold, and the way Clinton pulled it off
(with those so-called &quot;side agreements&quot;) amounted to competent
coalition-juggling -- and fairly public too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During his '92 campaign, Clinton had proposed a &quot;New Covenant,&quot;
under which different types of responsibility would become the price for
continued government support. His party, running Congress during 1993-94,
did not go along. Ironically, those Republicans who aren't ideologically
opposed to activist government -- chief among them Speaker Gingrich -- COULD
go along with the Clinton's 1992 themes as well as his Memphis framework.
So? Look for the New Covenant to come back in '96 with a different name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Certain U.S. Presidents (JFK and LBJ occasionally, Teddy Roosevelt all the
time) have put forth sweeping proposals -- &quot;deals&quot; in the national
interest -- to groups inside their own political tent. Doing so acknowledges
the latter's influence -- while forcing them to use at least some of it
for a non-selfish purpose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contrast that with today's Republican candidates for President -- the people
who expect to replace Clinton and become Gingrich's main ally. They trudge
before all the hot groups -- gun-owners, medical interests, tobacco farmers,
Perot conventioneers -- and hand out plates of red meat festooned with iron-clad
pledges. FOR WHAT? No one, not even a habitual horse-trader like Phil Gramm,
so much as hints that these single-issue or self-righteous voter blocs owe
him, or the country, anything back. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Mr. Would-Be President and Guardian of the National Interest, if you
are too much of a weenie to suggest something exalted, everyone watching
on C-SPAN assumes you require only the petty: PAC money and petitions and
buses for election day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Especially today, more national officials need to notch down their interest-group
checkmarking and try out the Gingrich/Clinton model: BE real in your major
addresses, and GET real with some of your otherwise demanding audiences.
Float a deal -- not a petty one, but exalting: &quot;I will stick my neck
out for you here, but I expect a helping hand to transform this issue afterward,
for America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guess what? Whoever sees this play out whole will be reassured. After all,
national cynicism is so thick that few believe a candidate acts on altruism
or principle anyway. We assume their &quot;no strings attached&quot; pledge
is supposed to be rewarded, <I>sub rosa</I> and backstage, by money or access
later. Wouldn't it be far healthier to see our political leaders TRADE the
risks they take for some compatible restraint or innovation from the interest
groups each one has to work with? Bill Clinton did so to save NAFTA, and
Newt Gingrich is already refining this creatively &quot;transactional&quot;
leadership model for the great Medicare struggle. More leverage to him.<BR>

Plummer </A><BR>&amp; Charles C. Mann</I></CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><HR></CENTER><P>Many of the battles to come, as a Democratic Administrations faces aRepublican Congress, will be the sort of meanspirited partisan scufflesthat Americans love to deride. But sometimes the smoke and dust of the fraywill conceal a matter of principle, even philosophy-as in the case of thereauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>Like many laws, the act must periodically be reauthorized, which is to saythat the federal government must occasionally renew its own authority tofund the act's enforcement and administration. Reauthorization was scheduledfor 1992, but Congress postponed action indefinitely-its members did notwant to touch the issue in an election year. In the meantime, frustrationwith the law has been building. The inevitable debate will probably takeplace this year, perhaps within the next few months. It will be bloody,as they say inside the Beltway. At issue will be the nation's biologicalheritage, more or less, and a vision of its economic future. Conflict willbe engaged by the usual operatives: lobbyists representing some of the nation'smost powerful interest groups. <BR><BR><BR>Opponents call for narrowing the scope of the law, claiming that societyis spending billions to protect the Penland beardtongue, the fat pocketbookmussel, the giant kangaroo rat, and a cavalcade of other creatures withabsurd-sounding names. The Endangered Species Act, in their view, threatensto usurp so much private property and capsize so many jobs that it may wreckour very economy. Proponents declare the law inadequately enforced and demandthat its protections be extended to more species at a faster rate; otherwise,they claim, we risk trashing our biological life-support system. Weakenor fortify?-that is the tenor of the debate. One question is rarely addressed:Can the law be more responsive to the concerns of both sides? <H2><CENTER><BR><BR>*****************</CENTER></H2><BR>The Endangered Species Act orders the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, abranch of the Department of the Interior, to protect species recognizedas endangered, without regard to cost. The goal is to banish extinctionfrom the United States. Unfortunately, the present system has failed utterlyto do this. Species are going extinct anyway, and the threats are multiplying.For every species that Fish and Wildlife has successful removed from theendangered list in the past tow decades, it has added more than one hundredothers. <BR><BR><BR>This outcome would have surprised the members of Congress who passed thelaw, in 1973. Implicit in the debate over the act was the assumption, stillheld by many conservationists today, that endangered species could be savedwithout sacrifice: if development affects a species here, we can just movethe development or the species someplace else. since then it has becomeclear that the reasons species become endangered are not always trivial,and that saving them is not so simple. <BR><BR><BR>Anyone who has walked in the western parts of Albany, New York, can seethe problem. A hundred years ago the area hosted one of the world's largestpopulations of the Karner Blue butterfly, a lovely little bug that appearedon the endangered list at the end of 1992. The former haunts of the butterflyhave been taken over by an interstate highway, a power substation, a campusof the State University of New York, and several hundred middle-class homes.In other words, the butterfly was endangered by the satisfaction of ordinaryhuman desires to drive around, switch on lamps at night, learn about interestingthings, and live in a nice home. <BR><BR><BR>Because human interests cannot be ignored, not al species can be saved.yet the current system demands the unattainable: all species must be saved,and human interests must be ignored. Amplifying this dissonance has beenan unwillingness in Congress to award the Fish and Wildlife Service morethan a paltry budget to enforce and administer the law. As a result, theagency has been driven to impose conservation tasks on those private-propertyowners who are unlucky enough to have land that sustains endangered species.To be safe from possible prosecution, they must verify that using theirproperty will cause the creatures no harm. Endangered species thus becomea liability that encourages otherwise responsible citizens to call in thebulldozers at the first glimpse of an endangered bird or lizard. <BR><BR><BR>Both sides of the debate recognize these flaws, but they disagree on howto remedy them. Supporters of the law cling to its impossible goal, callingfor increased budgets and stricter enforcement. This would turn Fish andWildlife Service biologists into ecological mandarins, making choices forentire regions which must favor the interests of other species and not people.Such overbearing regulation would increase the incentives for landownersto destroy pristine land, with predictably disastrous environmental consequences.<BR><BR><BR>Not that opponents have a better answer. Many call for compensating landownersfor any decrease in the value of their property brought on by species protection.But this amount to little more than replacing ecological mandarins witheconomic mandarins, whose decisions would be equally predictable and equallydisastrous. <H2><CENTER>********************** </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>What will it take to do a better job of saving our natural heritage? Theforemost change must be to recognize that our values are manifold. If wevalued only trees and streams, we wouldn't hesitate to save them, no materwhat the cost. If we wanted only cement and steel, any part of nature beyondthe minimum necessary to sustain life would become expendable. If the pastis any guide, the debaters in Washington will blindly favor one side orthe other. Progress will be possible only if the unrealistic demands ofthe Endangered Species Act are scaled back and supplemented with a way ofsatisfying some of the needs of affected landowners. <BR><BR><BR>The demands of the current law should not be eliminated entirely, though.Even if a species fails a strict cost-benefit test, few people would supportits extinction without pausing to reflect. Protecting species is a taskthat deserves a place in the political life of our country, alongside otherbasic values such as protecting health, maintaining the nation's defense,and fostering education. <BR><BR><BR>In other words, a balance must be struck. Part of that balance should befor landowners to concede that our ecological inheritance is important enoughto justify some regulation of their land. Another, equally important partof the balance should be for conservationists to concede that developmentplans that threaten species are reflections of the human desire to havestores, roads, schools, homes, and the like. The two concessions point inthe same direction: neither species nor developers should win all the time.The question is when and where each should prevail. <BR><BR><BR>Moneyed interests, of course, will always threaten species and other environmentalassets that cannot pay their way. The most appropriate counterweight isnot to outlaw human nature but to award some money to environmental protection.merely throwing money at the current system, however, will only exacerbatethe problems inherent in the endangered Species Act. <BR><BR><BR>One solution would be to create an Endangered Species Trust fund, to promoteconservation in ways more compatible with American values and culture. Thefund could underwrite a variety of programs, from ecological research toeducational advertising to conservation assistance to outright land purchase.It could encourage landowners to share their land with species in trouble.The state of Wisconsin, for example, already has such a program, which coversseven species on the federal endangered list. Landowners agree to a nonbindingprotection plan, and are rewarded with a picture of the species, a certificateof appreciation, ongoing species-management help, and, most important, thebelief that they are voluntarily doing to right thing. According to thestate, most landowners happily go along, although the program is unlikelyto deter big development plans. <BR><BR><BR>Not all species can be protected by voluntary programs, of course, and wherenecessary the trust fund could help subsidize conservation efforts by landowners.One possible model is a program sponsored by the Defenders of Wildlife,a Washington-based conservation group, which offers a $5,000 &quot;bounty&quot;to each landowner who has an established wolf den on his or her property.The trust could also promote commercial practices that are environmentallyfriendlier but costlier than current practices. As the Soil ConservationService does for farmers and soil conservation, a Biological ConservationService, funded by the trust, could encourage foresters, ranchers, and minersto modify their activities, thus reducing-though not eliminating-harm toendangered species. <BR><BR><BR>In critical cases the trust fund would have the tools to restrict land usegreatly, albeit in a noncoercive manner. It could take a lesson from Thenature Conservancy, which protects some biologically valuable land by payingfor a conservation easement-a legal contract that forbids developing a pieceof property but allows the landowner to earn income through ecologicallybenign activities, such as certain types of agriculture. As a final resort,in places where almost any human activity threatens the other inhabitants,the trust fund could buy land and protect it as a biological preserve. <BR><BR><BR>Such an effort would be expensive, but it could go a long way toward removingour natural heritage from the mire of partisan bickering. Indeed, the ideaof a trust fund has quietly attracted interest from environmental organizationsand from advocates of property rights. Combined with a scaled-back EndangeredSpecies Act, the fund could help the nation provide environmental protectionwith less social conflict. Isn't that what it means to make the law responsiveto the people and the causes it serves? <BR><BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><B>Mark L.

Plummer </A></I><BR>&amp; Charles C. Mann<BR><HR></CENTER></H3><BR>	<B>Not </B>far from La Jolla, California, lies some of the vast undevelopedland left along the coast of fast-growing San Diego County.  Pardee Construction,the Weyerhaeuser subsidiary that owns the central portion of the land, plansto turn it into a suburban neighborhood.  But local environmental activistsbelieve it should serve a more valuable purpose:  The area forms a corridorconnecting the Los Penasquitos Canyon to the Torrey Pines nature preserves,a link that they believe would let some of the area's threatened speciestravel between the preserves.  Wanting to keep the corridor open, the activistshave been campaigning to block Pardee's plans.<BR>	Their efforts, however, have run into two big problems.  The cost of stoppingPardee could be as high as $40 million - the lands value, according to thecompany.  And the ecological value of such corridors is disputed by someof the discipline's leading researchers.  Indeed, wildlife corridors havequietly become one of the most important battlegrounds in conservation,with major development projects and the future of valuable nature preservesat stake.  <BR>	Many ecologists and conservation activists argue that corridors are criticalfor maintaining biodiversity.  &quot;Connectivity is absolutely crucial,&quot;say Reed Noss, editor of Conservation Biology , &quot;especially when you'retalking about a species that  doesn't have enough habitat in one place tomaintain a viable population.&quot;  As a result, big habitat-managementefforts in ecological hot spots such as Florida, southern California, andthe Pacific Northwest have focused on establishing links between blocksof habitat.  Corridors, Keith Hay of the Conservation Fund told Defendersmagazine (May-June 1990, pp. 19-30), &quot;hold more promise for the managementof the diversity of life than any other management factor except stabilizationof the human population.&quot;<BR><BR><HR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>&quot;Given what we know about the dispersal  of species and the persistenceof populations, &quot; he says, &quot;I think the burden of proof shouldfall on those who would deny corridors to a reserve system, not on thosewho lobby for them.&quot;</H4></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><HR><BR>	But other ecologists worry that efforts to preserve linking areas likethe one in La Jolla may be a shot in the dark.  &quot;People are encouragedto think there's a quick, easy answer - a technological fix - when there'sno evidence that quick, easy answers are forthcoming,&quot; says ecologistDaniel Simberloff of Florida State University.  Dennis Murphy, a conservationbiologist at Stanford University who advocates careful use of corridors,agrees with this assessment, pointing to the inherent difficulty of studyingcomplex ecological interactions in the field.  <BR>	One reason for the popularity of corridors, according to Hartmuth Walter,an ecologist at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles, is thatthey seem to provide a &quot;scientific&quot; rationale for activists topreserve locally favored parcels of land: &quot;It can always be describedas a unique link that must be used to preserve connectivity, which soundsbetter to them than 'just preserve this land because we don't want it developed.'&quot; But the result of this well-meaning application of science, he fears, mayin the long run not be good for either conservation of science.<BR>	Although the notion of ecological connectivity has a long history, it didnot appear in modern form until 1970, when Richard Levins, an ecologistat the Harvard School of Public Health, created the first mathematical modelof what he called a &quot;metapopulation&quot;: a set of linked local populationsof a species, each in its own separate patch of habitat.  <BR>	In Levin's formulation, the population of any given patch rises and fallsover time, there is always a small chance that the population on any individualpatch can vanish.  But the empty habitats can be repopulated if the membersof populations are able to disperse from patch to patch - if, that is, themetapopulation has sufficient &quot;connectivity,&quot; a term coined in1984 by ecologist Gray Merriam of Carleton University in Ontario.  In Levin'stheory, metapopulations can persist through time if the rate of recolonizationmatches the extinction rate.  <BR>	A widely cited example is the pool frog Rana lessonae, which lives in pondsalong the Baltic coast of Sweden.  According to Per Sjoren-Gulve of theGenetics Centre in Uppsala, the pools sometimes dry up, wiping out individualpopulations; when the pools refill, they are recolonized.  The species staysin equilibrium, as long as it has enough pools and frogs can migrate amongthem.  In a classic demonstration of the threat posed to biodiversity byhuman activity, Sjoren reported last year that the frog is threatened becauseforesters are draining and ditching these ponds [Ecology 75: 1357-67 (1994)]. <BR><H4>Theory becomes policy</H4>The intuitive clarity of such scenarios has produced a rapid flourishingof metapopulation theory.  In the 1980's modeling metapopulations becamewhat Simberloff calls a &quot;cottage industry - there must be hundredsof papers by now.&quot;  One reason for the appeal of this work, he says,is that &quot;the models are mathematically interesting.  You get thesefascinating theoretical results, like multiple stable equilibria.&quot; In such situations, the range of possible states for the metapopulationis mathematically similar to the range of possible locations for a marbleon a dented sheet of metal - it can rest in many locations, but cannot shifteasily among them.  <BR>	Theory has produced policy.  As ecologist Susan Harrison of UC Davis, putsit, many habitat managers now believe that a &quot;successful [biodiversity]strategy requires conserving numerous habitat patches and the potentialfor dispersal between them.&quot;  Corridors thus fill conservation plansin many of America's biodiversity backgrounds.  Florida has spent millionsof dollars to create them, including the construction of costly tunnelsunder interstate highways in an effort to link tracts of land suitable forthe endangered Florida panther.  In Riverside County, California, the protectionof corridors linking patches of habitat for the endangered Stephens' kangaroorat was a &quot;very important&quot; guideline in setting up the proposed17,400 hectares of reserves, according to the official habitat-conservationplan.  In the Pacific Northwest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approveda plan offered by the timber firm Murray-Pacific covering a 22,250-hectaretract of land that houses the endangered northern spotted owl.  The companygained the right to cut trees even if an owl is harmed, as long as the landitself is maintained as &quot;dispersal habitat.&quot;  On the grandestscale, the Wildlands Project - an attempt to map out a network of corridorsamong all of the nation's remaining undeveloped areas backed by Noss, MichaelSoule of UC Santa Cruz, and other influential conservation biologists -is intended to maintain connectivity across huge areas (Science, 25 June1993, p. 1868).<BR><H4>Gaps in corridor research</H4>But skeptics like Harrison and Simberloff argue that many plans to preservecorridors need closer examination.  In the first place, not all speciesexist as metapopulations.  &quot;The phenomenon  is a lot less ubiquitousthan it seems,&quot; says Harrison.  &quot;Just because you see patchy habitatsand blinking populations doesn't mean you have a situation where you havethis balance between extinction and recolonization.&quot;  And even if thereare good theoretical reasons for believing the metapopulation model applies,empirical research on connectivity is extraordinarily difficult.  &quot;Youhave to look at an entire set of populations over the landscape over a longperiod of time,&quot; she says.  &quot;The amount of energy you have tohave to collect the data running from patch to patch is incredible.  Theimportant processes - extinction and recolonization - are so rare that theyare virtually impossible to observe.&quot;<BR>	The difficulties are illustrated in research by Ilkka Hanski and threecollaborators at the University of Finland, who have conducted one of thefew large-scale studies of metapopulation dynamics.  The study, which tookplace in the Aland islands off the coast of southwest Finland, focused onthe Glanville fritillary (spotted) butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, which breedsin small dry meadows at the end of summer.  During that period, the researchteam repeatedly surveyed 1530 suitable butterfly meadows - some as smallas 12 square meters - in an area of 3500 square kilometers.  They foundthat neighboring populations tended to rise and fall in synchrony, suggestingthat the whole area indeed held a metapopulation with many possible states(Nature, 19 October, pp. 618-621).  Yet because the Finnish team has only2 years worth of data, Harrison cautions, the results of this &quot;veryambitious and very exciting&quot; study remain &quot;compatible with otherexplanations&quot; than metapopulation dynamics.  The populations couldbe independent and the synchrony only coincidence.<BR>	Even if a metapopulation exhibits connectivity, corridors may not be neededto provide it.  &quot;When you look at populations that are naturally fragmentedthey often aren't connected by corridors,&quot; says R. J. (Rocky) Gutierrezof Humboldt University in California, a wildlife biologist who has studiedbird populations in the western United States.  &quot;Yet there are populationsof these species on habitat islands.  That's an indications that  they canreach these islands independent of corridors.&quot;  He points to Manhattan'sCentral Park as an example.  &quot;You have a good complement of [northeastern]migratory birds there,&quot; he says, &quot;and there's not corridor connectingit&quot; to anyplace else.<BR>	Large mammals' need for corridors is intuitively easy to understand, becausethey often have large home ranges or use migratory pathways.  Indeed, PaulBeier, a biologist at Northern Arizona University, tracked cougars withradio collars and found that the animals always follow the same paths betweenpatches of habitat, even paths that are kilometers long and pass throughgolf courses and highway underpasses.  &quot;These animals will really usecorridors if they're available - even surprisingly poor corridors,&quot;say Beier.  And he has some evidence that such paths are needed: &quot;Thecats will not walk through a mile of tract homes.  None of the radio-taggedanimals ever did that.&quot;<BR>	But even this evidence isn't conclusive.  The best way to prove that organismsuse corridors, Simberloff says, is to cut them off and see what happens. But in a real landscape, this is a rather difficult proposition.  Beieracknowledges, for example, that he couldn't cut off all the cougars' possiblecorridors to see if they could still find their way across the landscapebecause the corridors wind through private property and under freeways. Moreover, because corridors are not always self-evident, it would be hardto know what to cut.  Ted Case, an ecologist at UC San Diego, says thatecologists usually define corridors by vegetation types - strips of forestland between the lawns of suburban developments, for instance - but speciessuch as salamanders may follow different trails.  &quot;I'm not as surethey are responding to vegetation types, rather than microbes in the soilor fungus or ants,&quot; Case says.<BR>	Finally, Simberloff also points out that corridors can have down sides. They can allow disease, predators, and exotic species to spread througha metapopulation.  And corridors, which are sometimes touted as ways toincrease genetic diversity among populations, may also function to decreaseit, because the migration among individual populations may end up geneticallyhomogenizing the metapopulation as a whole.  Like the evidence in favorof corridors, Simberloff admits, these possibilities are largely theoretical. But, he adds, &quot;there are examples of predators,&quot; such as easterndiamondback rattlesnakes, that use corridors for &quot;trap-lining&quot;- that is, lying in wait for their prey along a corridor.  He also citesa 1987 study that found corridors facilitating the spread of exotic feralpigs through forest fragments in New Zealand, menacing a genus of tree snail(in D. A. Saunders et al., Nature Conservation: The Role of Remnants ofNative Vegetation, Chipping Norton, N.S.W.  Surrey Beatty, 1987.).<BR>	<H4>Making trade-offs</H4>The land between the Los Penasquitos Canyon and Torrey Pines nature preserveexemplifies many of these issues.  The area is hardly pristine wilderness. Laced with roads and suburban neighborhoods, it is bordered on the westby the eight lanes of Interstate 5, one of the most heavily traveled roadsin the country.  But in the middle is a relatively undisturbed mesa coveredwith scrub and chaparral.<BR>	Pardee's plans call for creating a development of almost 1000 homes on160 hectares of this mesa.  In exchange, the company would set aside a numberof other parcels - including a wildlife corridor that snakes around thedeveloped areas and past I-5 by way of a tunnel an a proposed bridge, forminga 3-kilometer route between the two reserves.  This corridor will keep thetwo reserves connected, Pardee believes, and allow large predators likecoyotes, bobcats, and cougars to maintain a presence in Torrey Pines, whichin turn may help prevent it from being overrun by squirrels and smallerpredators like feral cats and raccoons.  <BR>	But corridor advocates like Soule and Michael Beck of the Endangered HabitatsLeague, a southern California environmental group that is spearheading thefight to protect the mesa, argue that this skinny, winding path is not enoughto ensure connectivity and safeguard Torrey Pines from isolation.  Theywant to see the development on the mesa moved to the southern portion, creatinga much wider corridor through the northern part and preserving much of themesa's scrub and chaparral.  And they have vowed to fight Pardee. <BR>	This is, advocates say, the only cautious and prudent course.  Noss arguesthat in the absence of hard evidence, it is always a good idea to maintainexisting connections whenever possible.  And Beck, who admits there is nodefinitive evidence to support the mesa's use as a corridor, agrees thatthe best course is to be conservative.  Pardee's development proposal, inhis words, &quot;is not biologically conservative at all.  It takes theheart out of the mesa.&quot;  He believe Pardee's needs are sufficientlyflexible to allow a wider corridor.<BR>	Skeptics think corridor boosters are going to give up a guaranteed dealthat will create open space in favor of an unproven scientific concept. Studies similar to Beier's UCLA's Walter points out, suggest large mammalsneed no more than the narrow path called for in Pardee's plans.  Moreover,he says, the &quot;caution&quot; of corridor advocates actually disguisesother risks.  Money does not grow on trees, the ecologist says, and tappingpublic coffers to buy the mesa almost certainly precludes spending fundson other conservation efforts.  Noting that exotic plants and other formsof degradation plague the Torrey Pines reserve - an observation that hasbroad scientific support - Walter asks if the area's limited conservationresources might be better spent on restoring the reserve's ecological health.<BR>	Beck worries, however, that without the biggest possible link, the degradationin Torrey Pines will only continue.  &quot;If we write off wildlife dispersalto Torrey Pines,&quot; he says, &quot;it won't have the dynamic mechanismsthat balance wildlife activity.&quot;<BR>	The debate over the corridor through the mesa, like may others around thecountry, must be resolved without the evidence scientists usually rely uponto settle such disputes.  To Walter, it is risky for scientists to comeout strongly for a concept with such uncertain empirical backing.  &quot;Howare we going to get Congress to listen to biology if they think it is beingused solely as an excuse to stop development?&quot; he asks.  And he worriesthat the result could be a discrediting of science.<BR>	Others argue that development pressure is too intense to allow researchersto work with perfect data, no matter what they do.  But they disagree aboutwhat to do  in the absence of evidence.  &quot;Corridors are not bad perse,&quot; says Harrison, &quot;but there's a range of [possible conservationstrategies], and you should at least consider them before blindly rushinginto things.&quot;  Murphy doesn't disagree, but feels that corridors shouldbe given the benefit of the doubt.  &quot;Given what we know about the dispersal of species and the persistence of populations, &quot; he says, &quot;Ithink the burden of proof should fall on those who would deny corridorsto a reserve system, not on those who lobby for them.&quot;<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Charles C.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Death and taxes are known as life's certainties. Far less common,
but much more enjoyable to contemplate, is the death of a tax. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, a little-known technology may be about to accomplish what generations
of Americans have joked and dreamed about -- and both the new Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer and his predecessor, Chairman Sam Gibbons,
have said they desire: the annihilation of the income tax. Now it is becoming
possible, and perhaps even necessary. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before proceeding to describe (in loving detail) the imminent demise, let's
remember why the murder is justifiable. The income tax discriminates against
savings and investment. Economic growth and job creating are penalized.
As the tax system grows ever more complex, and changes pile on changes,
the cost of compliance grows even more rapidly--unalloyed economic dead
weight. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of the resources that would be freed, and the human happiness that
would accrue, if all the tax lawyers and accountants were put to work doing
something useful. Think of all the gains to taxpayers once they were freed
from the burden of compliance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The cost is more than economic. The complexity of the system also causes
fear. People rarely know what the proper tax liability is. For most large
businesses and many individuals, the only thing they know is that the amount
they paid is probably wrong. And though we may be amused each April-by the
news stories about leading accounting firms and IRS offices each calculating
a different liability from the same data, the consequenes are not so funny.
Each year the IRS tries to send people to jail for not determining a liability
that is, by the very nature of the system, almost impossible to calculate.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, also, the very Congress that claims to want to get the government
off people's back is complicating the system even further. Among the various
tax cut bills that have been introduced, only Rep. Dick Armey's flat tax
bill will produce significant simplification. Left to themselves, it is
unlikely that the legislators, buffeted as they are by the lobbyists and
lawyers, will ever summon the courage to put the IRS out of its, and our,
misery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, computer hardware and software may soon do what Congressmen
and Senators will not. For centuries, people have paid their bills, and
received their income, by cash or check. But, these costly methods of payment
may be coming to a rather abrupt end. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transfers greatly reduce the costs of transaction and the possibility
of loss. Americans are now starting to pay their bills by using credit and
debit cards, and by inexpensive &quot;Smart Phones.&quot; These systems
provide customers with a full record of income and payments: good for record-keeping,
bad for privacy. In fact, the IRS is already working on a system to gather
all your financial information electronically and prepare your income tax
return for you. That might crimp the tax lawyers and accountants a bit,
but the Big Brother/police state aspects are at least as unpalatable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There is, however, a technological alternative. An experiment now underway,
called &quot;E-cash,&quot; is operating in Amsterdam by a company named
DigiCash. The electronic version of the anonymous paper dollar is now with
us. Individuals will be able to move their funds around the world, literally
at the speed of light, from one bank to another or to a creditor, without
the bank knowing to whom the money was paid, or the creditor knowing from
which bank or even country the money came. <BR>
<BR>
Through the use of cryptographic technology (scrambled numbers for personal
codes), the ease of conducting electronic transaction would be combined
with the elegant anonymity of paying in cash. The two most important features
of the E-Cash system -- security and anonymity -- will be ensured by using
cryptographic digital signatures to establish the authenticity of the payer,
wile at the same time assuring his anonymity and untraceability. The virtual
electronic dollar bills will, at the same time, be assigned individual electronic
serial numbers, which will also be checked for authenticity. The bank will
know how much to pay and what code to pay it to, but will not know the owner
of the receiving code, hence the payee too remains anonymous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, the IRS doesn't like it. But the matter may be beyond their control.
In the next few months, Americans will be offered two competing versions
of the future. The first is the society in which all of your transactions
can be monitored by the government (and other interested parties). The second
is where you as an individual choose which of your transactions will be
made available to curious eyes, and which will remain anonymous. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many in the government and other organizations will argue for a ban on anonymous
systems arguing that such capabilities benefit primarily drug traffickers,
money launderers, assorted terrorists, and plain old tax dodgers. Libertarians,
on the other hand, will warn of the dangers that accrue when government
has almost total scrutiny of individuals. One doesn't have to imagine what
a Hitler or Stalin could have done with such a system. Merely imagine anyone
trying to get Senate confirmation for government service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the fears of both sides are correct. Happily, some of the
legitimate fears of the government can be mollified by repealing the income
tax and substituting a value-added or business transfer tax. Anonymous systems
will still make it easier for criminals and evaders to do what they are
already doing successfully, especially as private encryption protocols are
developed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But without an income tax it won't matter. The gains to the American people,
economically and psychologically, will be magnificent. Even the government,
which relies on public trust, will gain. And on such terms, that would be
a very good thing. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conventional wisdom holds that the truth is usually in the middle.
But when the middle is in the space between two erroneous extremes, the
truth is probably somewhere else entirely. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Case in point: the growing debate over the income tax and possible alternatives.
The macroeconomic statist approach - the legacy of Marx, Keynes, and assorted
other socialists and do-gooders - is now discredited. Few seriously hold
that the state has unlimited potential to do good, and should be funded
accordingly. But the microeconomic statist approach, in its unthinking acceptance
of the notion that alternative taxes should bring in at least as much revenue
as the income tax, is also flawed. For the fundamental question is not how
to raise money for the state, but what is the right size government to enable
maximum economic welfare. We now know that we should bring total government
spending down from one-third to one-quarter of GDP in order to maximize
the social welfare, opportunity and freedom of our citizens. This is how
we found out. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For thirty years after World War II, it was conventional wisdom that increasing
the size of government would lead to higher levels of prosperity. However,
by the 1970s, it was evident that the macroeconomic statist model wasn't
working. In much of western Europe and the U.S., capital formation and growth
rates fell and unemployment increased. By the 1980s, it was also evident
that the economies of some Southeast Asian nations with small governmental
sectors (such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) were growing at much
higher rates than had previously been thought possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Economists thus began looking at the relationship between government size
and economic growth. In 1986, economists of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
(myself included) analyzed this relationship for 22 countries. We found
that slowdowns in growth rates were significantly correlated with growth
in the government share of GDP. Our best estimate was that government maximized
economic growth when it was between 15% and 25% of GNP. Since then, many
more studies have confirmed our work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It should not be surprising that there is an optimal size for government.
Too little government can reduce growth. Government needs to spend enough
to assure a fair and predictable system of justice, national defense, and
basic public health and education, and to enforce contracts. However, all
government spending entails extracting wealth from the private sector, either
by taxing or borrowing. The larger government becomes, the more severe these
extraction costs become. Eventually, they crowd out private sector investment,
reducing productivity, capital formation, and growth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
High tax rates reduce incentives to work, save, and invest, and involve
ever-increasing collection and compliance costs. Also public spending is
less efficient than private because it often misallocates resources and
lowers incentives for cost-controls. Government spending programs also tend
to develop their own constituencies, and generate political pressures to
increase spending that have nothing to do with the general welfare. Benefits
concentrate in certain groups, while costs diffuse throughout the population.
When these benefits take the form of income redistribution rather than,
say, defense or capital spending, negative effects are especially severe.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, for the United States, the right size government (at all levels) is
no more than 25 percent of GDP, and perhaps considerably less. About two-thirds
of this necessary reduction, from the current 33 percent to 25 percent of
GDP, should come from relative reductions in federal spending. This will
require elimination of most counter-productive spending programs, such as
agriculture and energy subsidies, and changing Social Security and Medicare
into genuine annuity and insurance programs. And, a new tax system that
is less intrusive and less biased against work, saving, and investment needs
to be designed and implemented for the correctly sized government. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The country may be edging toward serious consideration of such a simple
but profound change. The first evidence is that people are finally willing
to start thinking about it in various academic and think tank seminars.
But the real test is likely to be the election of 1996 and whether a correctly
sized government - and what it entails - becomes part of a national political
debate. </BLOCKQUOTE>

If only the Titanic had hit that iceberg a little  differently, if only the hull hadn't been substandard metal, if only the  lookouts and the bridge had been less sanguine, if only the lifeboats...</P>  <P>Today, the American civil justice system is a Titanic sailing into the  ice fields of the 21st century. The problem is the &quot;litigation explosion&quot;the  ever-increasing number of lawsuits that Americans inflict on each other,  and the costly and vicious manner in which so many of these suits have  come to be handled. In terms of proximate causeswhat's happening on the  voyagethe situation has a distinctly Titanic-like quality. Attorneys know  the litany by heart.</P>  <P>If only the rules of evidence didn't reward courtroom manipulation.  If only the rules of discovery, which enable the parties to gather evidence  from each other, hadn't been broadened to allow virtually unlimited requests  for information, draining defendants of time and money. If only lawyers  hadn't been permitted to advertise, thus opening the door to solicitation  of clients. If only the rise of class-action lawsuits hadn't made tens  of millions of people into real and potential plaintiffs.

If only Americans hadn't decided that lawsuits could be  competitive business tools. If only Americans hadn't decided that lawsuits  could be powerful political weapons. If only Americans hadn't come to regard  lawsuits as get-rich-quick opportunities. If only the practice of law had  not evolved into a business. If only . . .</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>ut the problem goes beyond &quot;if only.&quot;</B>  The civil justice system is not merely suffering from adversarial viciousness  and self-interested greed. It is also systemically failing to meet the  emerging needs of the 21st century. Its premises must be reconsidered before  its practices can be reformed.</P>  <P>The purpose of this <I>Inquiry </I>is to set forth a plan for the reform  of the U.S. civil justice system. I shall argue four main points.</P>  <P>First, our present civil justice system is a product of the Industrial  Age, ill-adapted to the Information Age now upon us. Americans cherish  the rights and protections afforded by the Constitution, and properly view  radical alterations with skepticism and caution. However, it is time to  accept that an increasingly obsolete system now hampers the exercise of  these constitutional protections and the rights and values they protect.</P>  <P>Second, while the current tort reform movement has merit and deserves  support, the movement's proposed reforms are not, by themselves, adequate  to create an effective 21st century system.</P>  <P>Third, an effective 21st century system should exhibit the following  characteristics:</P>  <P>It should be significantly less adversarial than the present system.</P>  <P>Courts, to a large degree, should be organized by subject matter, not  by geography, and should evolve procedures appropriate to their specialties.  Judges and jurors must become more knowledgeable about the complex matters  on which they must rule. This means court-appointed experts and, in some  cases, expert juries and judges.</P>  <P>And fourth, if structural reform is to be effective, <BR>  it must be accompanied by attitudinal and behavioral changes within the  legal profession and the American people, especially business people. Attorneys  need to start thinking of their jobs in terms of creating solutions to  problems, not pushing the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; system to vicious  extremes. This &quot;mind-set&quot; training should begin in law school.  Business people should eschew the lawsuit as a competitive tool, seek out  reasonable resolutions of their disputes, and remember that they, not their  attorneys, have final responsibility for their cases. Conversely, corporations  should stiffen their resolve to oppose frivolous and predatory lawsuits.  Settling dubious claims out-of-court only encourages extortion.</P>  <P>The justice system should be just thata system of justice, which is  neither a lottery nor a gladiatorial spectacle. Fundamental structural  changes, coupled with equally fundamental people changes, can make it happen.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The System andIts Discontents</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Throughout recorded history (and probably before) there have been trials.  But the present American systemin which opposing parties argue their cases  in accordance with rigid rules of procedure and evidence, before a neutral  presiding judge and a passive jury drawn from the general populationis  a relatively recent phenomenon. We think of the present system as virtually  sacrosanct and ahistorical. It is neither. Rather, the present system is  an amalgam of elements, each of which underwent its own complex evolution,  and which were assembled in their present form only about two hundred years  ago.</P>  <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>  <B>Over ninety percent of all litigation in this country is concluded,  usually by agreement of the parties, before a final decision in court.</B><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>  <P>The jury, for example, began life as an instrument of the king. Groups  of local notables were called together to rule on cases of which they had  personal knowledge ... and often personal prejudice. It took nearly a millennium  for the jury to evolve into a neutral and passive body, knowing only what  the contending parties and the rules permit it to know. It took just as  long for the judge to evolve from royal officer to neutral presiding authority.  And it took even longer for the current attorney-client relationship to  evolve. For example, under the old &quot;party-witness&quot; rule, defendants  could not testify on their own behalf, since their testimony was presumed  tainted by self-interest. The practical result was that unscrupulous plaintiffs  often made false accusations against wealthy people who could not defend  themselves in court, but could afford to settle before trial. The present  system, whereby defendants can testify, subject to cross-examination, was  intended to correct this abuse.</P>  <P>But the adversary system evolved to do more than protect the law from  royal and popular pressures, and defendants from abuse. It also evolved  to meet changing mores and practical needs. Enlightenment philosophy placed  great value on the power of human reason, unfettered by custom or fear,  to reach correct conclusions. Judges could be both correct and fair; juries  could reason out the facts and make rational decisions. Examination of  witnesses, governed by logical rules, could produce facts that the jury  could grasp. Lawyers, trained in those rules, and owing a dual allegiance  to client and court, could develop cases on their own, reacting only to  the other side's evidence and moves in the hermetically sealed universe  of the rational courtroom.</P>  <P>The adversary system also made practical sense in an industrializing  era. Because it was not inquisitorial, it did not seek the absolute truth  at any cost; its ways were adequate to render predictable justice most  of the time. Because it considered only cases brought before it, the system  was open and flexible. Finally, common law's organic character it develops  following precedent meant that the law could keep up with the demands placed  upon it.</P>  <P>Today, this civil system is failing. Critics regularly offer the following  reasons:</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Blame the lawyers</B></P>  <P>This appears to be the most prevalent, perhaps the most popular, theory.  Variations on this theme include:</P>  <UL>    <LI>There are now too many lawyers.    <LI>Lawyers have become too greedy.    <LI>Lawyers are now just business people, not true professionals.    <LI>Lawyers own the legal system.  </UL>  <P>Indeed, it has become common within the legal community itself to speak  of a loss of professionalism, a malaise that partakes of these very images.  Like all stereotypes, these are both too general and too vague to explain  away the failures of the system.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>Americans now see lawsuits as lotteries</B></P>  <P>A second perceived cause is that Americans are now more willing to seek,  and juries are more willing to award, damages that far exceed real losses,  especially when the defendants are &quot;deep-pocket&quot; business entities.  Some critics link this to other contemporary social issues, from old-fashioned  populist resentment to the pursuit of victim status, unwillingness to accept  personal responsibility for one's actions, and an exaggerated and absolutist  notion of individual rights. Some so-called consumer activists contend  that only the threat of massive, perhaps ruinous punitive damages (often  inflicted via class-action lawsuits), can keep corporate America from launching  a veritable New Dark Age of shoddiness and criminality. Some frankly view  lawsuits as a means for redistribution of wealth. Thus, a vicious circle  is established, with political and economic agendas intensifying both the  people's willingness to sue and the lawyers' willingness to have at it  for maximum financial gain.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B>The courts are too congested</B></P>  <P>The litigation explosion has jammed the courts. But the civil system  is also weakened by the fact that due-process requires that criminal justice  cases receive priority. The result is more lawsuits, lasting longer. Many  drag on interminably and expensively. In some areas the system is breaking  down physically, due to lack of funds for example, to repair courthouses  or hire new judges and court personnel. It is obvious that delayed justice  imposes unfair, unwarranted financial and psychological costs on participants.  The result is bitterly ironic. Hundreds of years ago, defendants could  be forced to settle even the most preposterous suits because they could  not defend themselves in court. Now, in our modern, advanced system, they're  forced to settle out of court because they can't afford to defend themselves.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Deeper Problems</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>These reasons all have some validity. But four deeper problems are mostly  responsible for damaging the system. One is internal. Three derive from  changes in the larger society that the civil justice system must serve.</P>  <P>The first of the deeper problems is that, all too often, procedure has  come to dominate substance. Indeed, procedures originally intended to guarantee  fairness and impartiality have become weapons with which to bludgeon the  opposition into settling out of court. Over ninety percent of all litigation  in this country is concluded, usually by agreement of the parties, before  a final decision in court.</P>  <P>This &quot;adversarializing&quot; of procedure is especially evident  in the use of discovery in order to intimidate and hamstring the opposition.  The Information Revolution now upon us means that, thanks to computers  and copying machines, there is vastly more information to be accessed,  relevant to the case or not. For a few dollars, one party can now browbeat  the other with hundred-page, computer-generated, requests for information.  Between discovery of documents and deposition, a party can waste untold  hours of its own time, and pay thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees.  For major companies, many of which are involved in numerous simultaneous  lawsuits, settling even the most flagrantly predatory lawsuits out of court  is now widely regarded as just one more cost of doing business. Corporate  defendants may seem like endless fountains of wealth. However, in the end,  this is a cost passed on to consumers, shareholders and the economy at  large.</P>  <P>Another aspect of this &quot;adversarializing&quot; of procedure is  that, within the courtroom, rule-bending and manipulationmuch of it accompanied  by undue belligerence and deliberate incivilityhave become far too common.  The most spectacular recent evidence of this occurred in the criminal field,  during the O.J. Simpson trial. Whatever one thinks of the Simpson verdict,  nearly everyone was appalled by the conduct of the trial itself: the studied  rudeness and tactical tantrums, the manipulation of jury selection, the  withholding of evidence, the game-playing and occasionally flagrant disregard  for rules. Far too often, a tendency to such behavior is encouraged, consciously  or unconsciously, by clients who give their attorneys license to savage  the opposition, even when compromise and civility might be more in their  own best interest. The legal profession itself encourages this trend. When  publications such as the <I>National Law Journal</I> and the <I>American  Lawyer</I> rank lawyers on the basis of verdicts won, i.e., by their size  and visibility, an attorney's incentive to win big can easily become his  or her primary consideration. On the surface, this desire would seem to  serve the client's interests as well. But not always, and not automatically.  Whether in a family or a business, for example, one often must maintain  a civil relationship beyond the time of a particular lawsuit. In the long-term,  a system that rewards procedural ruthlessness and incivility is in nobody's  best interest.</P>  <P>The second, deeper problem is the astonishing complexity of even routine  casesa complexity that grows greater year by year. Once, courts had to  deal with only a few kinds of cases, usually based upon limited information  which, presumably, was available to, or at least understandable by, the  average citizen. Once, there were few expert witnesses, no jury consultants,  and few forensic devices beyond Sherlock Holmes' magnifying glass. Once,  a jury of one's peers meant a jury of one's neighbors, chosen (rightly  or wrongly) without regard for racial, ethnic, and gender diversity.</P>  <P>Today, these conditions have changed. Lawyers long ago had to specialize.  The ABA now recognizes over twenty different areas of legal practice. Yet  courts remain generalists. A judge might preside over a relatively simple  tort case one week (or year), then a complex, high-tech, international  case the next. It is no longer reasonable to expect that juries selected  by the old system can cope with the complexityno matter whether that system  yields doctors, business people, and professors, or welfare mothers and  the unemployed. All too often, faced with the baffling complexity and excruciating  duration of modern civil cases, jurors tend to vote their feelings, not  the facts.</P>  <P>The third problem is that geography no longer matters the way it once  did. Today, when information and capital travel the globe in seconds, when  business increasingly is transnational and the legal systems of many countries  may be involved in a single dispute, the old organization of courts by  <BR>  geography no longer makes sense.</P>  <P>The final problem may be the most intractable. Americans have become  so diverse a people that it is increasingly difficult to define a set of  shared values. Today, pressure to conform to a dominant culture has been  replaced by pressure to emphasize and celebrate one's differences. For  many, primary identity and values now come from groups based upon gender,  language, race, sexual orientation, religion, or life-style. It is, of  course, ironic that this age of rapid globalization should also witness  the re-emergence of such powerful centrifugal forces. Still, it is not  surprising that given the stresses of globalization, many should come to  prefer the relative security found in smaller groups and subcultures. Still,  if the law is to be more than a minimal set of procedures for getting along  in an increasingly complex and hostile worldif the law is also to help  tell us who and what we areboth globalization and diversity must be given  their due.</P>  <P>In sum: when a plaintiff can win a million dollar settlement from McDonald's  because its coffee was too hot, when suing and being sued become normal  ways of doing business or pursuing political and social agendas, when procedure  triumphs over substance, distorting justice, when jurors can't even comprehend  the cases they must decide: It's time for fundamental reform to make the  legal system accord with new realities.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>A Proposed Solution</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Many of the reform proposals currently under consideration have merit,  especially those that would streamline pretrial procedures, limit discovery  and deposition, and limit punitive damages. These deserve support. Also  deserving support are <HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>  <B>Today, when information and capital travel the globe in seconds, ...  the old organization of courts by geography no longer makes sense.<HR ALIGN=LEFT>  </B>reform efforts tied to individual products or industries, such as the  manufacturer/labor/consumer alliance that led to the General Aviation Revitalization  Act of 1994, and the securities legislation that the 104th Congress passed  over President Clinton's veto. But these must be interim measures at best.  Only fundamental reform can create a system adequate to the needs of a  21st century economy and society.</P>  <P>I propose that the civil justice system be restructured as an integrated  system of specialized courts, organized according to subject matter. I  will call these &quot;Specialty Courts,&quot; each handling a particular  field, or the area where different fields converge. For example, there  could be specialty courts for the environment, telecommunications, and  intellectual property rights. A computer/telecommunications specialty court  might handle disputes arising out of these converging technologies. Many  arrangements are possible.</P>  <P>The idea is far from unprecedented. There long have been specialty courts  for the military, as well as in areas such as taxation, bankruptcy, juvenile  justice, and family matters. As mentioned, lawyers have had to specialize.  It is time to adopt this form of organization across-the-board, with general  courts perhaps reserved for minor or rare categories. (This reform would  not directly affect the criminal justice system.)</P>  <P>Each specialty court will contain a hierarchy of forums. At the bottom  will be informal and formal alternative dispute resolution services offering  mediation and arbitration. These would be voluntary. Above this level will  be juryless proceedings, trials by small juries or panels of judges, and  above that, full jury trials. Each specialty court would adopt the structure  and procedures most appropriate to its unique subject-matter needs. The  specialty courts would then flow into the appropriate appellate system,  thence to the state-level courts of highest resort and the U.S. Supreme  Court. These and other supervisory institutions would insure that Constitutional  protections would continue to apply.</P>  <P>Specialty courts will not be staffed by generalists, nor will juries  be selected in the old way. Decision makersboth judges and jurieswill have  at least<BR>  some training and expertise in their specialties. Specialty courts also  may have their own expert staffs. This will lead to better decision making,  expediting the process, and lessening dependence upon the contending parties'  hired experts. After all, asking lay people to decide which of two feuding  experts is correct when it involves using evidence that is deemed too technical  for lay people to understand without expert help, makes little sense.</P>  <P>There is, however, an obvious potential drawback. Expertise does not  guarantee impartiality. Court officials and staffs could be populated by  activists intent upon their own agenda. This issue must be addressed in  structuring the specialty courts. There are also obvious dangers inherent  in creating what might look like a corps of professional, or quasi-professional,  jurors. In the new system, it will not be neccesary or desirable to create  a class of professionals. Depending on the subject matter, knowledgeable  participants can be drawn from any number of broad pools. Some baseline  familiarity with the subject matter at hand is the key.</P>  <P>The total number of specialty courts, and their individual organization,  will be determined by the needs of the people. This must be an evolutionary  process. At the start, it might be useful to follow the current structure  of law-practice specialties, as listed by the American Bar Association.  Beyond this, some specialty courts might be organized by industry, some  by product type, others by consumer profiles. The important point is to  maintain the integrity of the subject matter. This can be accomplished  in many ways. And some overlap may be both inevitable and desirable.</P>  <P>Specialty courts will be overseen by governmental bodies, although the  pattern of oversight may, in some cases, be more complex than the current  federal/state/advisory board arrangement. Family courts, for example, would  be overseen by the states; commercial courts would require federal supervision.  Regional oversight may be appropriate in some cases. Courts dealing with  international matters may need to operate in accordance with accepted international  norms, but with the clear understanding that this does not constitute a  form of embryionic &quot;world government.&quot; Perhaps these international  bodies would exercise jurisdiction only when all parties agree, on a case-by-case  basis. Perhaps, at the international end of the specialty court hierarchy,  mediation and arbitration would be more appropriate than the granting of  full jurisdiction.</P>  <P>But even these structural changes, profound as they are, will be ineffective  without corresponding changes in human behavior and attitudes. In today's  global, multicultural environment, the legal profession must move away  from its present winner-take-all, combative mindset, toward creating less  adversarial processes and solutions. Education in this area must begin  in law school. Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) training should be  enhanced. Many lawyers now offer ADR services. A way should be found to  grant ADR decisions some sort of precedent status within the common law.</P>  <P>Similar mindset changes must occur outside the profession. Americans  have become to quick to run to the court house to solve their problems.  They need to return to a more creative and positive approach. If they do  get involved in litigation, they, too, must assume a less adversarial mentality.  Typically, litigants tend to forget that their lawyers work for them. Also,  business peopleperhaps led by their trade associationsmust move away from  the notion that lawsuits are a normal part of doing business, seeing them  as either a tool to use on the competition or an inevitable operating cost.  This may entail not only limiting one's propensity to sue, but also stiffening  one's propensity to fight predatory and frivolous suits. The same &quot;deep  pockets&quot; that make it possible to settle out of court can also make  it possible to fight the kind of extended battles that may have a deterrent  effect down the road.</P>  <P>Finally, in recent decades, the civil justice system has come to be  used extensively as a means of advancing a litany of social and political  agendas, at <BR>  least some of which would be better addressed outside the litigation context.  Some of thisthe early civil rights movement comes to mindwas necessary,  given the recalcitrance of the political process. But to the extent that  political issues become routinely judicialized, we diminish both our political  and our legal systems, and the country as a whole suffers. To the extent  that lawsuits become a means of intimidating opponents, the system is rendered  corrupt.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></I></B></P>  <P>Reforming an institution as complex as the American civil justice system  is an undertaking of no small audacity. It will encounter intense opposition:  some of it self-interested, some of it ideologically-driven, and much,  no doubt the product of prudence. After all, as Thomas Jefferson wrote  in the Declaration of Independence, forms of government are not to be changed  for &quot;light and transient reasons.&quot; But Jefferson also wrote that  &quot;any form of government&quot; can become destructive of the ends for  which governments are established.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Information Society was
formally introduced in June 1994, in Corfu, Greece, with the issuance of
the so-called Bangemann Report, Europe and the Global Information Society,
and its implementing successor, released in July 1994, Europe's Way to the
Information Society, An Action Plan. Since that time, the European Union
has become aggressively involved in the regulation of all aspects of the
information society. The results take Europe in a direction potentially
at odds with North America and the rest of the world, damaging the European
Union's trading partners and -- as <A HREF="ggindex.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow, George Gilder </A>alleges -- Europe itself.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Two themes characterize the European Commission's
position on the information society: federalism and protectionism. The Commission
has taken a broad and in-depth view of its role in the development of the
European information society, and is promulgating laws on the Internet to
govern the 15 independent European Union member states. In fact, the European
Union appears to be utilizing the advent of the information society to facilitate
the exercise -- and some would argue the expansion -- of its federal powers.
It also is utilizing the information society as a means of adopting protectionist
legislation that conflicts with the inherently global nature of the Internet,
and that could threaten to diminish that very integral aspect of the Internet.
Recently-adopted and proposed EC (European Community) legislation in the
area of intellectual property serve as examples of these two characterizing
themes of the EC's approach.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission's launching of its Information
Society initiatives followed closely on the heels of the Clinton administration's
announcement of a U.S. federal focus on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The U.S. approach to the information superhighway, going back to at least
1994, appeared to be directed toward the same stance as that of the European
government's. Vice President Gore announced the Clinton Administration's
willingness to intervene in the Internet if private interests failed to
promote an agenda which conformed to the vision of a widely-accessible,
safe new medium for U.S. citizens to deploy in both philanthropic and commercial
ways. But he also made clear the Administration's preference for private
development and little regulaiton. The U.S. Congress has been even more
inclined to preserve a an open, free-market environment. With certain notable
exceptions (the Clipper Chip, the Communications Decency Act), the U.S.
federal government has intervened in regulation of the Internet to a much
lesser extent than the EC, and when adopting or proposing laws, ihas shown
greater respect for free trade principles.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The EC's federalist and protectionist position,
when compared with the more decentralized, balanced position of the United
States, can be explained by certain economic facts. First, it is undisputed
that the U.S. is the technological leader in software, telecommunications,
and other information society technologies. Widely-reported balance-of-trade
figures support this common understanding. Second, while the U.S. has the
benefit of existing federal laws to govern certain critical aspects of the
Internet, the EC is still--in many respects--in the formative stages of
creating a European nation-state. While a unified European information society
can benefit U.S. interests by providing a single, more integrated European
market, the EC's aggressive investigation into regulation of Internet-related
laws should be carefully monitored by U.S. industry, to ensure that such
&quot;federally&quot; promulgated laws do not unfairly prejudice U.S. information
interests. Moreover, international trade negotiations need to consider whether
creation of globally-fragmented Internet-related laws threaten to devalue
one of the key assets of the Internet -- its inherently free and global
nature.<BR>

</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">One need only look to current laws being proposed,
investigated and adopted to support the proposition that the EC views the
information society as a key mechanism for promoting a unified Europe. Virtually
all aspects of the information society -- from education and privacy, to
technical standards and intellectual property -- are being reviewed by the
EC. The following is a summary of just a fraction of the European initiatives
which have been promulgated since mid-1994 in regards to the information
society.</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission derives its power from
the European Treaty and has the authority to regulate the laws of the individual
European member states, now numbering 15, to the extent such laws create
disharmony in the European market. In the intellectual property area, it
is the position of the European Court of Justice that, under the European
Treaty, the European government has the power to regulate the exercise of
intellectual property rights, but not the existence of such rights. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, recently-adopted European legislation
indeed appears to legislate even the existence of such rights, in an ever-increasing
expansion of federal power. For example, the recently-effective Directive
on the Term of Protection of Copyrights extended by 20 years the length
of copyright in most member states, and revived certain copyrights that
had expired. Similarly, the recently-adopted EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases creates intellectual property rights in databases where, under
the laws of certain member states, none existed; and the recently-created
Community Trademark, in essence, creates a unified bundle of national trademark
rights, where heretofore recourse to each individual national trademark
authority was required to obtain such rights. These are examples of areas
in which legal rights are being created by the European government which
were historically--and under the European Treaty still are--within the sole
province of the member states' governments.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">This centralized promulgation of laws can, in fact,
be advantageous to U.S. information industries. Brussels is becoming a location
at which Euuropean interest groups can consolidate their lobbying efforts.
Also, unified laws across the 15 European Union countries can result in
lower cost-of-entry barriers to marketing goods and services in Europe.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">However, these advantages are lost when the centrally-promulgated
laws discriminate against non-EU individuals and entities. Such discriminatory
treatment, at least in the intellectual property area, is growing more common.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">III. Protectionist approach <BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The Internet is widely regarded as potentially
the single most important technological contribution to global human communication,
education and societal relationships since the telephone, the television,
and the computer. As such, laws should be developed globally to benefit
those who wish to participate individually or commercially in such medium.
The Internet is inherently borderless. Technologies are just being developed
to enable more segmented, selective deployment of the Internet; however,
the basic presumption -- and value -- of the Internet is that it is instantaneously
global. Fragmented laws governing the Internet complicate its effectiveness,
and jeopardize its global utility. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The European Commission publicly recognizes the
importance of the global nature of the Internet, and even acknowledges the
need for international cooperation in its development. However, recently
promulgated laws indicate that the EC will utilize its federal power, as
well as the new ease with which foreign companies can enter the European
market to promote its own industries and interests. A comparison of recent
parallel intellectual property legislation on both sides of the Atlantic
illustrates the differences in the EU and U.S. approaches to regulating
Internet interests.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The recently-effective EC Directive on the Term
of Copyright Protection explicitly excludes from extended protection works
of authorship which are of non-EU member state origin. By contrast, the
proposed U.S. Copyright Extension Act would extend copyright protection
for all World Trade Organization member individuals and corporate authors.
Where the EC Directive discriminates, the proposed U.S. law does not. The
EC acknowledges this discrimination in its preparatory comments to adoption
of this Directive, indicating that it wishes to encourage non-EU governments
to extend their term of copyright protection. As a trading partner with
vast riches of rather aging intellectual properties -- art, literature,
music -- Europe has obvious interests in extending the term of copyright
protection for such assets, particularly as a result of the expanded use
in the multimedia revolution. Nonetheless, one can ask whether this justifies
adopting legislation which creates a fragmented market -- where copyrights
are protected in some countries (e.g., the EU), and not in others (e.g.,
the U.S.); and where copyrights of certain national origin are given extended
protection, and others are not. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Similarly, the EC Directive on the Legal Protection
of Databases grants added protection for previously unprotected databases,
but only provided the interested party has a registered office in an EU
member state and has an ongoing operational link with an EU member state.
By contrast, the proposed U.S. Database Investment and Intellectual Property
Piracy Act of 1996 would, if adopted, accord increased protection for databases
on a non-discriminatory basis. Again, the result of the EC laws is a fragmentation
of the global market for such products, and, a consequential complication
and, therefore, suppression of the market. Insofar as the present state
of the Internet results in instantaneous and low-cost global distribution,
such fragmented laws conflict with the utilization of this uniquely global
resource. While it can be argued that the EC's discriminatory position was
based on legitimate motivation--encouraging industries to locate and operate
within the European Union--the fragmentation of the market that results
from such discrimination is against the inherent nature of the Internet.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Pica">IV. Conclusion<BR>
</FONT></TT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">The adoption of protectionist laws is obviously
not new to global politics. If a country can adopt internal laws which create
competitive advantage, its global trade and negotiating strength can be
increased. When a centralized force such as the European Union can use its
federal power to effectuate protectionist laws of 15 countries, the competitive
force of such an exercise of power is multiplied. However, adopting this
protectionist approach when promulgating laws which govern the Internet
results in obstacles to the effective use and development of such a medium.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">One could advocate that the U.S. retaliate by mirroring
such a protectionist stance in its own Internet-related laws. However, this
approach may only result in a further global fragmentation of legal use
of the Internet for global communications and commerce. The solution lies
rather in encouraging global cooperation on laws which directly impact the
use of the Internet, in the interests of all users. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Courier New">Rather than directing laws -- and technology --
toward a global fragmentation of the Internet, governments should be seeking
ways to preserve this inherently international asset. Rather than view the
information society and its technologies as an opportunity to gain nationalistic
competitive advantage, governments should nurture this resource as a means
of integrating global resources into a single, unified whole.</FONT> <BR>

the European Union will only assure continued decline of its economies in
the new age of networks. The Internet is inherently global and will route
around the attempts to nationalize, commisionize or parochialize it.&quot;</FONT>

damage Europe more than anyone -- and ultimately must fail.</FONT> <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that Jesus was really born about six B.C., not in the year
0, as you might expect. A sixth century monk named Dionysius Exiguus, who
was given responsibility for settling a dispute over the date of Easter,
miscalculated his account of Jesus' life and placed His birth about six
years late. This scholarly error, which was perpetuated in later calendars,
means that we already are in the 21st century, and, for that matter, in
the Third Millennium. <BR>
<BR>
There is a certain satisfaction in our unexpected arrival in the 21st century
and the new millennium, if only because it has caught the numerologists
off guard. It will be harder now for them to peddle their prognostications
when the merely nominal millennium rolls around. <BR>
<BR>
But the new century, if not the new millennium, already has begun intellectually,
too--and politically and culturally. Just as the fin de si&egrave;cle 100
years ago closed down the 19th century in a burst of fashionable despair
mixed with exciting new ideas about nature, man and society, we are now
witnessing rejection of many of the prevalent ideas of the 20th Century.
And again something new is coming onto the stage of history. <BR>
<BR>
What seems to be happening intellectually and politically is the cumulative
repudiation of the whole grim, pedantic, utopian, hedonistic-yet-moralizing,
centralizing, pyschologizing, determinist, reductionist, relativist, modernist
project of the 20th Century. And I say, good riddance! <BR>
What may replace it is a revitalized version of what used to be called the
liberal tradition of the West, facilitated by new science and new technology.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Case Against the 20th Century </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there was some good to the 20th century, and some necessary change.
For example, we probably did need a civil service to replace the political
spoils system--though we later got carried away and let bureaucracies regulate
away many of our freedoms. We did need civil rights protection through central
government action in order, finally, to right the great wrong of slavery
and to fulfill the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. But the best
intellectual innovations of the 20th century were in the fields of science
and technology--medicine and communications, notably. Most of the others
were of lesser significance or were baneful. <BR>
<BR>
Not only did the 20th century bring us the scourges of fascism and communism,
but, to a lesser degree, it brought us what the Alexis de Tocqueville correctly
foresaw as the &quot;democratic tyrannies&quot; of socialism and the welfare
state. Specialization and expertise flourished, bringing great benefits
in some areas, but also contributing to the depreciation of the liberal
arts. Over-emphasis on expertise also tempted leaders in one field to claim
authority in others, which is always a moral usurpation. Some generalists,
in turn, claimed the label of science for arts and crafts that did not deserve
it. This holds true for several of the &quot;social sciences,&quot; but
especially for something that grandly calls itself &quot;political science.&quot;
Even economics claimed more scientific stature than it deserved, guided
by the late 20th century conceit that the qualitative can always be quantified.
What the experts and pseudo-experts did was separate ordinary people from
their government and culture, robbing their authority and undermining their
morale. <BR>
<BR>
Not only was the authority of representative democracy undermined, but so,
too, was God's. It was the century that popularized the &quot;God is Dead&quot;
movement and--professing &quot;science&quot; again--tried to free us from
what modernists considered the superstition of religion. We actually created
an official culture--not in Russia, but in the United States!--that frowns
on expressions of religious faith in public life. We even self-censor, making
faith a non-subject in leading private as well as public arenas. Most American
youth grow up without any grounding in religious faith, or take a naive
Sunday school faith into combat with sophisticated university debunkers.
<BR>
<BR>
We are a more materialist culture than ever before. But materialism itself
is deadening. It has created a great cyst of loss and sorrow in our collective
soul. <BR>
<BR>
Among elites, few are religious, or even seriously stoic. Instead, they
worship a kind of debonair high style, and, of course, they worship health.
For them, as Jackson Lears says in his history of advertising, salvation
equals peak performance in the bedroom, the bathroom and the boardroom (and,
one might add, the exercise room). <BR>
<BR>
But isn't it odd that this age of materialism has seen such an efflorescence
of real superstitions? They range from New Age channelers to cable channel
psychics charging $4 a minute. <BR>
<BR>
Spiritual demoralization -- the loss of moral bearings and morale -- affects
the way we raise families and conduct our work. The professions today, especiallay
law, medicine and teaching, already are infected by demoralization. So is
journalism, which adopts cynicism as a reflexive attitude. In turn, &quot;all
this cynicism has permeated society,&quot; says Queens University Professor
George Rawlyk in the Vancouver Sun, &quot;and caused people to lose faith
in institutions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Politics is definitely demoralized. Bureaucrats and experts--including that
strange breed, the professional &quot;ethicist&quot;--have trod on the cord
of responsibility that links the elected official to the electorate. More
worrisome, young people know almost nothing of the system of representative
democracy and therefore are bored with it, when they are not disgusted.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The False Promise of &quot;Reform&quot; </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The so-called &quot;reform movement,&quot; once volunteer, but now professionalized,
aims to take the politics out of politics and replace it with juicy personal
scandals or mere titillating innuendo. Whereas the communists said the political
is personal, which made the state's role tyrannous, the present-day reformer
says the personal is political--and transforms the private gossip of politics
into subjects of public litigation. That is distracting, and it, too, can
become tyrannous. <BR>
<BR>
Over-regulating human life -- including public life -- destroys liberty.
When the laws governing politics become so voluminous and complex that no
one even knows whether he is in compliance or not, a candidate or office-holder
is at the mercy of anyone who investigates him. This is always the irony:
the more laws and regulations you have, the more inevitable lawbreaking
becomes. And, because everyone can be found to have broken some law, the
decision as to whom to prosecute becomes--once more--arbitrary. Yet it was
to resist the power of arbitrary authority that the rule of law was established.
<BR>
<BR>
When the current political reform movement gained sway about 25 years ago,
it was with the promise of restoring confidence in government. (I know,
I was a part of it.) But, all surveys show that public confidence actually
has fallen during the very period when reform laws have been enacted. <BR>
<BR>
Reform has become just another political weapon. Our experience is thus
an extreme recapitulation of the earlier reform period, the Progressive
Era, 100 years ago. Also starting with high ideals, a number of the progressives
ultimately descended into false and exaggerated accusations and personal
abuse of power. Theodore Roosevelt, himself a reformer, gave us the term
&quot;muckraker,&quot; borrowed from the low-visioned Man with the Muckrake
in Pilgrim's Progress. He could have been speaking of our own time when,
on another occasion, he remarked, &quot;Whoever said that 'Patriotism is
the last refuge of a scoundrel' had not considered the possibilities of
'reform.'&quot; 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Birth of 20th Century Thinking </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
From where did the past century get such curious reversals of virtue and
vice? Well, much of the force of 20th century modernism, for good and ill
alike, developed from industrial era science and industrial era ideas. Without
succumbing to over-generalization, one can still point to telling patterns,
especially in the work of the great thinkers of the later 19th and early
20th centuries, and of their followers, whose influence still is with us.
Chief among them: Karl Marx, Frederick Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Charles
Darwin and Albert Einstein. <BR>
<BR>
Through such thinkers, science, which really did accomplish great things
in the past century, also was misused to create the materialist culture:
atheistic, relativist, and cynical about personal virtue, yet blithely prepared
to build a New Society. Marx, for example, gave us the term &quot;dialectical
materialism,&quot; the priority of matter over mind. He taught class warfare
as a just pursuit and assailed bourgeois morality. Like most social engineers,
he created a system where everyone was exposed as self- interested, except,
of course, for himself and his favorite abstraction, the workers. <BR>
<BR>
Nietzsche taught us the &quot;will-to-power,&quot; the claims of self-expression
and moral relativism beyond good and evil. On the extreme right he inspired
the Nazis. And yet he also was the progenitor of the New Left and the hippies
in the 1960s. Nietzsche taught that there is no God, but that you can be
a god. From deconstruction in academia to the cynicism of the media, his
effects seem as strong as ever today. <BR>
<BR>
Freud was another brilliant, single-minded simplifier whose perspective
reflected the industrial era in which he lived. To him, a person is like
a steam engine, full of tensions that have to be released--thrusting pistons
and opposing forces. It wasn't just his emphasis on sexuality that was exaggerated,
but also his willingness, and that of his followers, to misapply their gifted
insights into mental disorders to a wide range of other fields, including
religion, war, history, philosophy, art and literature. <BR>

So far, Darwin has stood the test of time better. But the uses to which
his ideas have been put are another matter. He never wanted to apply natural
selection to human society, and yet, far right and left both made bold use
of Darwin's ideas to do just that. From Social Darwinism to National Socialism
to the view of man as a soulless animal, Darwinism has been used to justify
complete disregard of the poor, on one hand, and the practice of eugenics
and euthanasia on the other. How instructive it is that the little metal
fish symbols some Christians stick on their autos are now mocked on other
autos by little metal amphibians with &quot;Darwin&quot; written on them!
<BR>
<BR>
Einstein was locked into relativity (which, of course, is not to be confused
with relativism), a theory that explained certain relationships between
time and space, matter and energy. Einstein wanted physical laws that would
hold true anywhere. Most of his discoveries were made before 1906 and he
spent the rest of his life trying to disprove the uncertainty principle
at the foundation of quantum theory-still seeking a mechanistic explanation
for the universe. But he failed. What Heisenberg, Planck and, more recently,
Richard Feynman, revealed is that atoms cannot be deterministically defined,
and that at the heart of every atom are mysterious and infinite waves. In
other words, matter doesn't matter--at least not as much as we thought.
<BR>
<BR>
But if materialism, even in physics, no longer prevails how can it possibly
be used, as Marx and several other industrial-era thinkers (or their followers)
attempted, to define the life of the human mind and the organization of
society? 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Return of Freedom </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is that it cannot, and the good news is that this intellectual
realization is beginning to affect our social and political life. As much
as anything, the technological revolution that is built on the science of
quantum physics and probability theory, makes this clear. The silicon chip,
the computer, software, fiber optics, and wireless telephony are among the
great triumphs of mind over matter. The Industrial Age thus has given way
to the Information Age. The effects are seen not only in communications,
but in the broad economy, where work is being decentralized and personalized
and where intellectual property now competes in value with physical property.
<BR>
<BR>
The information revolution helped topple the Soviet Union, which could not
compete with American high technology and could not tolerate the openness
resulting from computers. Indeed, it could not resist the force of the new
technology in part because communism is a rigid, centralized, industrial-era
system. But the USSR and other command economies and political systems are
not the only ones threatened by the new information freedom model. So are
almost all overly centralized, bureaucratic organizations that operate the
way they did in industrial times. <BR>
<BR>
The revolution is now beginning to shake the earth under the U.S. federal
government. And other levels of government. And great universities. And
even the public school system. It is affecting our thinking about transportation
and the future of cities. <BR>
<BR>
New technologies are &quot;only&quot; tools, of course, but history shows
that once man creates new tools, the new tools tend to reshape the way man
lives. <BR>
<BR>
They surely will overthrow the contemporary version of television, the last
great example of industrial age technology. TV broadcasts from a central
point where all the power resides. It, too, is a top-down power structure.
You take what you get, and what you get is standardized, because it must
appeal to the lowest common denominator of a mass audience. The new technology
that is about to take its place- -including especially what George Gilder
calls the &quot;teleputer&quot;--will be interactive as well as multi-media.
It is a bottom-up power structure, liberated from the center, and free of
the potential for Orwellian propaganda controls found in industrial-era
communications. <BR>
<BR>
Leftists would have you believe it is elitist; it is not. You, as user,
will control it, selecting exactly what you want and when you want it. Videoconferencing,
family gatherings in cyberspace, new ways to learn exactly at the pace suitable
for you or your child, and choices tailored to what is individual and distinctive
about you: All these are designed to serve your own interests and pursuits,
not those prescribed for you. They will connect you to others near and far
who share those interests--say, pre-Columbian art or gardening or learning
a foreign language. Already the Internet is providing alternative sources
of political action and news. Some critics think it threatens to bring us
mass direct democracy, unscreened from temporary passions and runaway enthusiasms.
I believe it is more likely to help restore the authority of representative
democracy. <BR>
<BR>
The new communications technology both reflects the disintegration of materialist
assumptions and contributes to that disintegration, so the process is robust.
Nonetheless, we will long have to deal with the cultural and political detritus
left over from the collapse of the materialist dispensation. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, it is exactly among the educated elites that ideas of materialism
took strongest hold and it is also within those quarters that confusion
and uncertainty-- demoralization--is greatest. But the average citizen,
never having drunk as deep at the well of 20th century ideology as did the
elites, is not as ill-prepared for the 21st century. Ordinary people, surveys
show, still believe in God, still believe in objective right and wrong,
still credit common sense, human nature and a Jeffersonian, rather than
a deconstructionist, understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
They even persist in the benighted, pre-20th century view that art has something
to do with beauty and truth. As the late Christopher Lasch put it, the early
20th century writer and critic Ortega y Gasset's fear has been proven wrong;
the &quot;masses&quot; did not revolt against western civilization, only
the elites did. <BR>
<BR>
And now many people seem to be revolting against the whole soft tyranny
of modernism. This is really the 18th and 19th century liberal tradition
reasserting itself for the 21st century. <BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;liberalism&quot; here, of course, is not the left fork that
political liberalism took in this century, but the older understanding of
a free and civil society--with its institutions of representative democracy,
limited government and freedom from arbitrary rule, belief in progress,
tolerance, emancipation from dogma, and individual rights coupled with personal
responsibility--all tutored by civic virtue. This tradition rebelled against
a state church, but in this country almost always presupposed a divine order.
<BR>
<BR>
This classical liberal tradition was the consensus tradition of the United
States, distinguishing us from the Old World order. As Thomas Jefferson
proclaimed after the bitter election of 1800, &quot;We are all federalists
and we are all republicans.&quot; In the 1950s this point was observed again
by the so-called &quot;consensus school&quot; of historians, including Louis
Hartz and Richard Hofstaedter. It was a point that Francis Fukuyama made
in his essay, &quot;The End of History,&quot; a few years ago. <BR>
<BR>
The old liberal tradition moves forward in harmony with the individualist,
free-market drive of the information revolution. It is in harmony, also,
with government's appropriate functions, so it does not reflexively denigrate
public service. It is the tradition so despised today by campus reactionaries
on the left, steeped as they are in the paradoxically anti-Western influence
of such Western rebels as Marx and Nietzsche. The liberal tradition survives
such assaults precisely because it is open and ready to learn from other
cultures. In this, it looks back to the rich moral and intellectual resources
of the liberal arts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the liberal arts have consisted of language, philosophy,
history, literature, mathematics and abstract science. These subjects help
a man or woman to reflect upon how to live one's life, how to learn and
to interpret change. In the information age, these subjects are more precious
than ever. For now, when one opts out of a liberal education and into mere
professionalism or tradecraft, he is both likely to find himself impoverished
mentally and rendered obsolescent by constantly changing technology. <BR>
<BR>
It is quite possible that we already have hit bottom in the disregard of
the liberal arts and are beginning to look up. A recent report, for example,
shows the study of the classics increasing on college campuses. At 28,000
students, classics enrollment is higher than it has been in almost 30 years.
The classics teach not only the dead languages of Latin and Ancient Greek,
but also the history and philosophy of the Greeks and Romans, and those
works are as vital as ever. Happily, they can betaught today with the aid
of CD- Roms. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, what is called conservatism is the political movement most
congenial to revival and restatement of the liberal tradition for the 21st
century. One sees this in those state capitols where governors are exploring
new ways to hook social and economic policies to human nature rather than
to abstract, welfare-state ideals. One sees it in Congress where House Speaker
Newt Gingrich refuses to adhere to the barbarian caricature of his adversaries
but pursues a coherent and old/new fashioned restatement of the goals of
limited government--and with panache as well as vision. <BR>
<BR>
But, obviously, this great seachange cannot be confined to any one party,
let alone one figure. Many nominally on the political left today are intrigued
by the possibilities that new intellectual understandings and new technologies
can improve public policy in unanticipated ways. Indeed, they are influenced
by today's intellectual currents on the right in the same way, for example,
that the right in earlier times was influenced by the Progressive Era and
the New Deal. <BR>
<BR>
Regardless, much that until recently was unthinkable is now on the table.
We used to describe someone as &quot;so conservative he wants to privatize
the Post Office.&quot; Today, in the age of overnight courier services,
FAX machines and E- mail, privatization is taking place with hardly any
one noticing. Twenty years ago you could not find mention of the word &quot;privatization&quot;
in the lexicon of public policy. Now the loose consensus on the value of
privatizing many government activities stretches from the Republican right
to Chicago's Democratic Mayor Richard Daley. The call for decentralization
comes from governors of both parties. Democratic senators such as Bennett
Johnston (LA) and Wendell Ford (KY) join Slade Gorton (WA) and Dirk Kempthorne
(ID) in calling for the Endangered Species Act to be rewritten. Even President
Clinton indicates support for revisions, if not repudiation, of affirmative
action, and finds a whole host of leading black intellectuals, such as Thomas
Sowell, Shelby Steele, Stephen Carter, and Glenn Loury already there. <BR>
<BR>
When one side of the political spectrum starts to embrace the positions
and policies of the other, something profound is happening, not only to
politics but to the culture. <BR>
<BR>
I suggest that what is beginning to happen is the restoration of a noble
and correct view of the world. When Aristotle wrote his Politics and his
Ethics, he defined a way to determine what is good--the Golden Mean between
&quot;excess&quot; and &quot;defect.&quot; In specific application of those
absolute standards to a particular principle, however, man was to look to
consequences as well as to means, and employ prudence, the virtue of good
judgment. When it came to public philosophy, Jews and Christians found common
ground in such a moral philosophy, and undergirded it with revelation. Indeed,
as C.S. Lewis wrote, you do not requirereligion to find that common ground,
or, as he called it, the Tao. For God gave man reason, and through that
reason, most civilizations apprehend the Tao. 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Untangling the Materialist Mind </H3>
<BR>
It wasn't simply materialism that failed, but utopianism, which is its contradictory
and yet complementary twin. The materialist/relativist tells us that there
are no normative standards; for example, the definition of a &quot;family&quot;
is anything you want it to be. (After all, you have your &quot;values&quot;
and I have mine.) The utopian impulse in the same modernist mind is much
sterner. When it comes to endangered species or product liability or sexual
harassment, it dictates absolute purity of means, as well as purposes. Thus,
on one hand, we have moral vagueness, and, on the other, rigidly moralistic
emphasis on processes. What both of these superficially dissimilar modernist
impulses--which normally co-habit--have in common is that neither looks
very much at consequences. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, for the founders of the liberal tradition, the Greeks, the
object in politics as in life was not the triumph of one interest or one
consideration, but the balance, the harmony, of interests and considerations.
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders also clearly stood in that line. The great goal of
the 21st Century, following the classical liberal tradition, is to recover
that sense of harmony in life--the sacred and the practical, private virtue
and civic virtue, and the personal in balance with the political.<BR>

<h2>This 'Liar' Business </h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>





I want in on the Hillary business, for reasons natural (that's where 
the action is) and unnatural (I am among those who think it important 
what language you use). The water she lives in had been getting hotter 
and hotter, and then a few days ago columnist William Safire of the 
New York Times ran his diagnostic fingers over the accumulation and 
concluded that Hillary Clinton is "a congenital liar." 
<p>
One winces a little on seeing the charge against her expressed in 
exactly that language. To begin with, we don't know -- do we? -- 
whether when she emerged from the womb shouting Beeeh! she knew very 
well that the situation called for her to shout Baaah! but as a 
congenital liar she could not avoid dissimulation. A liar being 
someone who somewhere along the line took to telling untruths, a 
congenital liar is someone who tells untruths because the truth simply 
won't come out of his lips. In the feud a few years ago between 
Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, kindled by Miss McCarthy's saying 
nobody could believe anything Miss Hellman said, Lillian complained, 
and Mary reiterated that everything Lillian writes is a lie, including 
"and" and "the." 
<p>
At that level, of course, charges and countercharges become polemical 
flourishes intended to titillate onlookers. They are no longer 
clinical distinctions between the truth and the non-truth. So by 
adding the qualifier "congenital," Mr. Safire gave away too much 
ground, and soon the whole country was seeing a smiling President 
telling a crowded press conference that, as President of the United 
States, he suffered under certain "constraints" which prevented him 
from dealing with Mr. Safire as he'd have done in private life. For 
those whose imagination wasn't keen enough to know just what that was, 
the White House press secretary Mike McCurry had given a hint. Citizen 
Bill Clinton would have poked Citizen Bill Safire in the nose. 
<p>
Now what seeps through all that stuff is, actually, some idea of what 
remains of the House of Chivalry. Not much. When that house was 
intact, you would never see a man seated in a bus while a woman was 
left standing. Any man who threatened publicly to poke another man in 
the nose wouldn't be noticed nowadays, on the grounds that that threat  was probably made in a crowded bar, where nobody heard or cared, or 
else it was made in a press conference announcing what the intention 
was of Mike Tyson to do to the challenger sometime in the future in 
Las Vegas. It is really surprising that the women's lobby didn't 
resent the language used by Mr. Clinton against Mr. Safire on the 
grounds that manifestly, it was sexist-talk. He wouldn't have said it 
if Mr. Safire's quarry had been a male. 
<p>
And so we arrive at the piquancy in this situation. Mrs. Clinton said 
a half-dozen things that weren't correct, most conspicuously that she 
hadn't personally insisted on firing the seven-man White House Travel 
staff. In fact, according to her ex-employee and Clinton pal Mr. 
Watkins, she did want them fired. 
<p>
But what fascinates is that this episode and a few others having to do 
with the nature of her relationship with the Madison Guaranty outfit 
invite the formal scrutiny of investigating panels and, theoretically, 
the courts themselves, because perjury is contingently involved. 
<p>
But the man who, if he weren't President, would poke Bill Safire in 
the nose, "lies," if that is the word for it, quite consistently. 
Anyone who has watched the tube over the past couple of months will 
have lost count of the frequency of Mr. Clinton's telling the people 
that the objective of the Republican Party's budget drive is to hurt 
the old, the homeless, the sick, the lame, the children, and the 
environment. If something is not true, and it is nonetheless affirmed, 
that gives us a lie, and the generator of that lie, is -- a liar? 
Forget the "congenital" business -- about which most of us don't know 
very much, since our memory reaches back only to when Mr. Clinton in 
the Sixties took marijuana but didn't inhale. How is it that 
politicians are shielded as they are? To get to the White House one 
promises one thing, does another. Or else reaffirms on Monday what one 
repudiates on Tuesday? Some would go so far as to guess that if he 
were simply "Mr." Clinton even then he wouldn't actually go to Mr. 
Safire's office and poke him in the nose. Clinton reserves such 
activity for larger bodies, like the Republican Party, or Congress, or 
the voters who vote for the wrong people. The voters who were lied to.

<hr>
<h2>Forbes's Rich Problem</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>






Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last November, that he would get anywhere tended 
to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy, yet here he is, 
running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday 
the other candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He 
escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by fellow Republicans, of 
course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>
He has split the conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm 
went after him lustily. This was in part a professional obligation 
(there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with 
Steve Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from 
Forbes's ads).
<p>
Forbes has of course been baiting Gramm in a television and radio 
campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. His complaint is 
that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays 
insufficient heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to 
supply-side policies. Gramm counters that you can't have effective tax 
relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes 
resists this, preferring to cite the prodigality of growth when the 
yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. It is a nice quarrel, and 
conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win. 
<p>
Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political 
scene are difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed 
Lamar Alexander to cope with. His company has a private airplane 
blissfully named Capitalist Tool. And his company has a gorgeous big 
yacht, which will take you around the world, if you press the right 
button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has examined 
the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, 
but the records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining 
them. The primary weight of their expense rests on the shoulders of 
the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>
There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing 
of great wealth. The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was 
relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing inclinations do not go in 
lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there 
were three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell 
Harriman was standard-bearer of the left wing of the Democratic Party; 
challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing of 
the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist 
fellow-traveler running on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen 
were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>
So that the Republican public, in a Republican primary, is not going 
to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve Forbes's wealth. It 
is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at 
the disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor 
souls who have to spend half of every day collecting nickels and dimes 
from house to house; but there is no indication that the public is put 
off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference 
between the cited popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people 
who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>
His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat 
tax would hurt the middle class, specifically, those who earn between 
$70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the first year, 
perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per 
cent, disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate 
income would mean a deficit, but one which, he vows, would soon 
disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. But of 
course the first thing done by the other candidates and their 
accomplices was to try to figure out how much less this would 
hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with what they 
figure out he paid last year. 
<p>
The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was justifiably inflamed 
at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for 
President of the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that 
will save the new President money on his income tax. The gentle Steve 
Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A 
rather convincing point: It doesn't really make sense to spend $20 
million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish one's tax 
payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the 
Hollywood movie whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered 
either of two alternative posts: Commissioner of Baseball, or 
President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his 
moustache, then said, "Which pays more?" 
<p>
Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.
<p>

<html><head><title>Buckley: Is There a God Behind Religion? - 1/19/96

<h2>Is There a God Behind Religion?</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>
Wm. F. Buckley Jr.


 

Most public discussion of religion has to do with earnest 
constitutional and political quarrels. Does the First Amendment 
prohibit the recitation of a public prayer in the public schools? The 
display of a crcche at Christmas? The display of the Ten Commandments? 
Then there are the derivative issues: Is the Christian Coalition 
dominating GOP politics? Do Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed have a 
stranglehold on the Republican Platform on the question of abortion? 
Homosexual marriages? Euthanasia?
<p>
Odd, but almost never does the discussion turn on religion itself. 
i.e., what is the excitement all about? If students heard a prayer in 
the public schools, or if religious sentiment crystallized against 
abortion, what is it all about? The public schools, for two 
generations, have proceeded without any notice taken of religion, as 
the Supreme Court has decreed. Interesting question, What about non-
public schools? Obviously one begins by excluding schools that are 
explicitly religious in orientation. One would expect that in the 
Catholic parochial schools, the Orthodox Jewish schools, the Episcopal 
schools, religion is an explicit factor. But what about others? There 
are 240 private boarding schools in America. What do they do? The 
Supreme Court isn't going to tell them what to do. They can worship 
the god Pan, if that's what the trustees decree. 
<p>
One doesn't know where to turn for an answer to that question: How 
does religion fare in the private non-denominational schools? But the 
mere inquiry provokes the curious mind to ask what is, one supposes, 
the primary question: Why?
<p>
A recent visitor remarks that attendance at her Episcopal Church has, 
in the past half-dozen years, increased by 100 per cent. Why? Is 
there, as we are here and there told, a religious "revival" in the 
offing?
<p>
Again: Why?
<p>
The anthropologists are there to tell us that it is in human nature to 
aspire for a spiritual life, even as it is in human nature to wish to 
exercise sexual appetites, and of course it is biologically necessary 
to appease hunger. The idea of the sociological set is, in effect, to 
say, There there, Mrs. Jones, we quite understand why you believe in 
God, etc., but kindly do so in a fashion that doesn't get in the way 
of public affairs, you know, like bicycle paths, or the diminishing 
supply of buffaloes. 
<p>
What surprises is the relative reticence of the religious community. 
In the United States, overwhelmingly, the Christian community. A 
politician running for office is prepared to say that he believes in 
school prayer because he insists that the Constitution does not 
prohibit school prayer. But ambient folkways prevent him from saying: 
I think Jesus Christ was divine and therefore I find the lessons He 
taught us illuminating and vital in affecting our lives.
<p>
Wow!
<p>
Does that make him an anti-Semite?
<p>
No no, Madam. He is an anti-Semite only in the sense that the patron 
of the Yankees is anti the Red Sox. Never mind the difference in the 
order of gravity, the point is that a Christian exercises his faith 
without believing that others' faiths are wrong, misled; even as, 
mutatis mutandis, the Yankee patron, always free to apostatize from 
his allegiance, nevertheless proceeds to demonstrate his loyalty. The 
Christian owes absolutely nothing more to other religions than a 
respectful toleration of them. The wonderful old saw about the inter-
religious conference in Tokyo fifty years ago is amusingly relevant. 
After the ecumenical blessing at the banquet, one participant turns to 
the pilgrim on his right. "My miserable superstition is Buddhism. What 
is your religion?"
<p>
It would be grand to hear public figures in the course of discussing 
this or that public or private question say, "Well on this matter, I 
am instructed, or try to be, by the New Testament, which, you know, 
tells us that greed is, well, you know, wrong. So is adultery. . . . I 
don't say I live up to the Christian calling, all I say is that I wish 
I did because I recognize it as truth."
<p>
There is no reason at all for the listener whose god speaks different 
tongues to object to the superordination of Christ over, say, Buddha. 
But the question before the house is: Why don't people say, more 
often, Yes, I love my country and my flag, and my God, but let me tell 
you Who my God is, and why what He has told me has for years and years 
given me comfort and fortitude and stimulated my love for -- yes, you, 
Madam. <p>
