INTRODUCTION
<p>
The congressional budget resolution for fiscal year 1996<i>1</i> calls for elimination of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). With its many sweeping changes, this resolution is both symbolic of the change in philosophy of this Congress and a very practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to dismantle the Department of Commerce,<i>2</i> and both the House Commerce Committee and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have held hearings.<i>3</i> The congressional leadership has indicated that the FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill will include language to close down the Commerce Department.<i>4</i>
<p>
The idea of closing the department comes entirely from Congress. The Administration's reinventing government initiative barely touches the Department of Commerce, which indeed cannot be "reinvented."  The proper course of action is to dismantle the agency, which is little more than a collection of disparate programs. The Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, and 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments.
<p>
To close the department, obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated, and duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments. Commercial activities should be privatized or ended -- leaving private corporations to pay for their own research, advertising, and other costs of doing business.
<p>
Specifically, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration.
<p>
<li>Use the staff of the Inspector General as the core for the transition work but abolish the office upon completion of this work.
<p>
<li>Close the Economic Development Administration, with outstanding loans to be collected by the Treasury Department.
<p>
<li>Consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistics Administration, within a single new independent agency.
<p>
<li>Transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department.
<p>
<li>Close the domestic offices of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the Minority Business Development Agency.
<p>
<li>Close down the Travel and Tourism Administration.
<p>
<li>Transfer the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the major part of the Commerce Department -- to other Cabinet departments that perform similar functions and close down the NOAA Corps.
<p>
<li>Establish the National Weather Service as an independent agency, with commercial services privatized.
<p>
<li>Establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation.
<p>
<li>Close down the Office of Technology Policy (Technology Administration).
<p>
<li>Privatize the National Technical Information Service.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology and transfer residual functions to the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
<li>Close down the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and privatize electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
</ul>
A Cabinet department reporting directly to the President of the United States ought to have a clearly defined mission and not continue year after year to function simply as an organization chart, tying together a loose collection of agencies. Defenders of the Commerce Department argue that its various activities are valuable and useful, but no case has been made that these functions cannot be performed in the private sector or elsewhere in government, or that they are more valuable than the budgetary resources consumed.
<p>
Because Commerce would be the first Cabinet department in U.S. history to be dismantled, the absence of clear precedents and procedure presents a challenge for the House and Senate task forces chaired by Representative Dick Chrysler (R-MI) and Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Title I of both their bills establishes a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. An administrator of this temporary agency, appointed by the President, would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function" according to "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency" that the President must submit to Congress within six months. The agency would have three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property.<i>5</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>THE "DEPARTMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS AFFAIRS"</b>
<p>
According to its own Inspector General, Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."<i>6</i>  The General Accounting Office reports the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" and shares "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<i>7</i>
<p>
Most of the department's resources have little or no relation to its purported mission:  "encourag[ing], serv[ing], and promot[ing] the Nation's international trade, economic growth, and technological advancement."<i>8</i>  For instance, nearly 60 percent of the agency's budget (about $2 billion per year) and some 37 percent of its staff are in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which conducts a number of environmental programs, including weather-related activities and research programs in marine and atmospheric sciences. Meanwhile, export promotion programs are distributed among ten different federal agencies:  "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<i>9</i>
<p>
Not only are many of the department's other activities -- especially its commercial operations — questionable as federal functions, but most badly need modernization and capital investment. Due to political and budgetary pressures, much of its capital stock is in disrepair. The GAO reports that departmental infrastructure -- "federal laboratories, a fleet of ships, weather satellites and radar, information systems, and other facilities and equipment -- will require investments of at least $7.4 billion over a 15-year period."<i>10</i>  The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>11</i>
<p>
The Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented."  The optimal course of action is indicated by the congressional budget resolution:  The department should be dismantled. Its obsolete and outmoded programs should be terminated. Its duplicative programs should be consolidated with other departments, and its commercial activities should be privatized or closed.
<p>
The following analysis examines each organizational unit in the Commerce Department and recommends how to terminate or transfer its activities. For reference, data from the President's budget<i>12</i> are included in tables at the head of each section, with full-time employment levels and budget outlays in millions of dollars for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. In addition, major programs are detailed with obligated spending in millions of dollars.
<p>
<br>
<b>Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration</b><br>
The position of Commerce Secretary was established in 1913 when Labor was separated from the original Department of Commerce and Labor, which was established in 1903. The new agency was supposed to foster modern industrial production, rather than agriculture (which already enjoyed its own Cabinet department for 41 years). 
<p>
The Secretary of Commerce often is portrayed as the advocate of pro-business policies in a President's cabinet.<i>13</i> But public policy decisions affecting business generally are not made in the Commerce Department. Rather they come from such agencies as the President's Economic Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Commerce, in recent administrations, has served more often as an important fund-raiser for his President's election campaigns than as the architect of policies to help the nation's commerce.
<p>
</b>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
The administrative and coordination functions of the Secretary of Commerce and supporting bureaus under his immediate authority should be assigned to a temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency, as provided in Title I of the legislation introduced by Representative Chrysler and Senator Abraham. The President would submit to Congress within six months "a plan for winding up the affairs of the Agency," and an administrator appointed by the President would have broad powers to "allocate or reallocate any function."  This temporary agency would have no more than three years to execute the legislative mandate:  terminating programs, reassigning civil service personnel, and disposing of surplus property.<i>14</i>
<p>
<b>Inspector General</b><br>
The Office of Inspector General was established in 1978 to provide agency-wide audits and investigations and to recommend corrections for waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b> 
<p>
Congress should close the Office of Inspector General, although its personnel could form the core staff for the temporary Commerce Programs Resolution Agency established by the Chrysler-Abraham legislation.
<p>
<b>Economic Development Administration</b><br>
During the Johnson Administration, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 established a program of grants and other financial assistance to targeted cities and rural regions identified as "economically distressed."  The Economic Development Administration (EDA) also operates the Revolving Loan Fund, lending money to state and local governments that they in turn lend to businesses. The EDA will spend roughly $362 million in fiscal 1995 and $401 million in fiscal 1996.<i>15</i>
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should close down the Economic Development Administration and direct the U.S. Treasury to collect all outstanding loans.<i>16</i> Congress approved $408 million in EDA spending for fiscal 1995, including $202 million for public works, $26 million in planning grants, $120 million for defense economic conversion, and $45 million in economic adjustment grants.<i>17</i> The EDA's development functions duplicate the activities of programs within the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Small Business Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.<i>18</i> On these grounds alone the program should be terminated.
<p>
Throughout the EDA's history, grants have been used by Members of Congress to distribute favors to constituents by "earmarking" funding to projects, bypassing the formal hearing process. This often means EDA grants go to locations with healthy economies that do not need federal assistance. In fact, the 17 states represented by the members of the relevant House and Senate subcommittees received $1.10 per capita in EDA grants during 1994, compared with 68 cents per capita in those states without representation, despite the fact that the average unemployment rate for the states represented was only 5.2 percent, compared with the national average of 5.4 percent that year.
<p>
The pork-barrel projects funded in the FY 1995 appropriation bill include:
<p>
<b>Egegik, Alaska.</b> The small fishing village of Egegik, with a population of 101, rests on the western shore of Alaska. Egegik has a per capita income of nearly $20,000 and is home to 23 families with an average family income of more than $60,000. Yet, in 1994, EDA granted the village $826,000 for the construction of a public dock. This is the equivalent of $8,178 for every person in Egegik.
<p>
<b>Key Biscayne, Florida.</b> A town of 8,854 residents, Key Biscayne is located in the middle of one of the most popular vacation spots in the country. Taking advantage of its beautiful climate and year-round influx of tourists, the local population enjoys a per capita income of more than $37,500. Yet Key Biscayne was awarded a 1994 EDA grant of $750,000 for the installation of a storm sewer system.
<p>
<b>St. Cloud, Minnesota.</b> St. Cloud University was awarded $91,512 in 1994 for the rehabilitation of its university center. According to EDA guidelines, these centers "must focus on service areas with significant economic distress."<i>19</i>  But this area hardly qualifies as distressed; St. Cloud has an unemployment rate of 3.0 percent and an above-average per capita income. Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.2 percent, the fourth lowest in the nation.
<p>
Almost all federal development programs, moreover, have proven to be expensive failures. Federal public works, job training, and regional development programs create few new jobs for the considerable amounts of money they cost to administer.<i>20</i> As a typical example, the General Accounting Office noted that no more than 35 percent of the beneficiaries of the Emergency Jobs Act of 1983 actually had been unemployed.<i>21</i> Another analysis suggested that only 84 previously unemployed people received jobs under the program at a cost of some $307,000 per job. The average private-sector job costs only about $40,000 to create.<i>22</i> Congress could do far more to spur economic development by closing down the EDA and using the savings to reduce the tax burden faced by private-sector employers, who are in a better position to create jobs.
<p>
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has  jurisdiction over the sections of the Commerce Department Dismantling Act that abolish EDA, voted instead on August 2 to support a measure that would preserve all of the pork barrel substance of the program.<i>23</i> It creates a new Undersecretary of Commerce and an Office of Economic Development to "replace" the current EDA and authorizes funding of $340 million per year for five years. Section 605 of the legislation even contains a provision to assure that EDA's functions will survive the elimination of the Commerce Department.
<p>
The proposed substitute bill adopts the model of the Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965 as a temporary response to poverty in 13 states, which today continues to provide highway construction grants and other financial aid to those states and local governments. The House committee not only reauthorized the Appalachian Regional Commission for five years, it created eight additional regional commissions as independent agencies, administering grants and loans for spending on government-financed projects. Up to 45 percent of the United States would qualify for pork barrel spending based on the following eligibility criteria:  per capita income of 80 percent or less of the national average; or an unemployment rate one percent above the national average for the most recent 24-month period; or sudden and severe job loss; or "a pocket of poverty."<i>24</i>
<p>
This effort by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is extremely ill-advised. The proposal for a group of regional commissions to hand out grants and below-cost loans will only perpetuate and expand the unsound practices of subsidizing construction projects for political gain. 
<p>
<b>Bureau of the Census</b><br>
The Bureau of the Census was established as a permanent office in 1902. In addition to conducting the decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution, the bureau continuously gathers and tabulates a wide range of economic and demographic statistics.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer the U.S. Census Bureau to a new independent agency, a Bureau of National Statistics, which would house all data collection functions of the government. Former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood, in her recent <i>Organizing to Count:  Change in the Federal Statistical System,</i> puts forth a practical and detailed proposal for such reorganization.<i>25</i> A centralized statistical agency for the United States, similar to that of Canada, also was recommended in The Heritage Foundation's <i>Rolling Back Government:  A Budget Plan to Rebuild America 26</i> and by the National Association of Business Economists.<i>27</i>
<p>
Section 207 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation would transfer the Census Bureau to the Treasury Department, which already performs substantial data collection in administering the Internal Revenue Code and collecting customs duties. The House and Senate task forces set out to reduce the size of government, not merely to rename existing bureaucracies (although Census would remain under their bill), so they call for no new independent federal agencies. But the benefits from establishing an independent Bureau of National Statistics are substantial. One of the most important would be to take statistical functions out of politicized bureaucracies and place them in an agency with no policy functions, thereby helping to insure that data collection is not influenced by political considerations.<i>28</i>
<p>
<b>Economics and Statistics Administration</b><br>
The Bureau of Economic Analysis was established by the Secretary of Commerce in 1953. It reports to the Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, who also oversees the Census Bureau. The two agencies together are known as the Economics and Statistics Administration, although the much larger Census Bureau is always identified separately. The agency draws upon the work of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and other data collection sources to compile the national income and product accounts and prepare forecasts and indicators of economic activity, widely followed by the news media and economists.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should incorporate the Bureau of Economic Analysis (along with the Census Bureau) within an independent Bureau of National Statistics, which would be responsible for all economic and demographic data collection and analysis for the federal government. Statistical functions of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health, and Labor also should be merged within the new agency.
<p>
Section 208 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation provides for transfer of the Bureau of Economic Analysis to the Federal Reserve System, which already performs substantial data collection as part of its banking regulation and monetary policy functions. As with the Census Bureau, sponsors are reluctant to establish any new federal agencies. The independent Federal Reserve, however, should not be assigned functions by Congress only tangentially related to its central role of monetary policy and policing the nation's payments system.
<p>
<b>International Trade Administration</b><br>
The International Trade Administration (ITA) was established in 1980 by the Secretary of Commerce and also encompasses the Bureau of Export Administration. The ITA is charged with promoting U.S. exports, both through "export promotion" advocacy and diplomatic intervention by Commerce officials. It also processes petitions by U.S. industries seeking antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory weapons to erect trade barriers against foreign producers and products.<i>29</i>
<p>
The Undersecretary for International Affairs also runs numerous other programs, such as the U.S. Foreign and Commercial Service, which target a handful of industries for export development. The Undersecretary has a Deputy Undersecretary and a Director of Administration, as well as a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and three other Assistant Secretaries, plus the Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service (which has offices in 68 countries throughout the world as well as 47 district offices and 21 branch offices in the United States).
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should transfer all Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, including direction of the Import Administration, Trade Development, and the Foreign Commercial Service (see chart above). The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy. Outside the United States, the Secretary of Commerce is perceived correctly as a minor Cabinet officer. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for U.S. currency exchange rates, U.S. policy in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and macroeconomic coordination among the G-7 industrialized countries. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring to the task.
<p>
To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements, a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries, the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department currently is responsible for all enforcement relating to matters involving taxation of transnational corporations, and this has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department.
<p>
As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct pricing of these imports and exports, both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.<i>30</i>
<p>
Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, which has been considered in hearings before the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, transfers all international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective but small agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees, which conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place all trade functions and more than 2,500 additional employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's economic leadership among world leaders, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports. Most witnesses at the recent congressional hearings expressed concerns about this change.
<p>
The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation<i>31</i> to establish a U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, along with the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. The insulation of trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the Administration.
<p>
<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to the new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had failed to correct a number of organizational problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer  --  without substantial reorganization  --  of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<p>
<br>
<b>Bureau of Export Administration</b><br>
The seven-year-old Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) administers export controls and coordinates the 17-nation Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM). The BXA's primary mission, therefore, is to safeguard the national interest by monitoring the export of potentially dangerous "dual-use" technologies.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should transfer the Bureau of Export Administration to the Defense Department. Controlling the export of militarily useful commodities is a national security matter. If such technologies proliferate, the burden falls on the military to solve the problem. The Department of Defense deserves to be involved directly in the export licensing process because it is in the best position to judge the military utility of particular technologies. Putting the responsibility for export controls in the hands of the USTR or the Treasury Department implies that export controls should be treated as a trade issue, not a national security issue. It would be appropriate, however, for controversial licensing decisions to be appealed to the presidential level.
<p>
A special interagency report issued by the DOC with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State drew attention to the duplication of export control programs by the BXA. The four-agency report concluded:  "Consolidating these functions under the appropriate official will provide not only the proper oversight but also a more efficient and effective approach for tracking referred applications and examining export trends."<i>32</i>
<p>
The bill introduced by Senator Abraham transfers BXA functions to the Defense Department, but the version introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Chrysler transfers export licensing to the State Department.<i>33</i> The legislation introduced by Representative Mica transfers all export licensing functions to the proposed new Cabinet department for trade.<i>34</i> Both the Chrysler and Mica proposals would introduce greater uncertainty for key U.S. export industries such as aircraft, chemicals, and computer technology. Transferring all BXA responsibilities to the Defense Department would correct the problem of administrative conflicts between agencies, but exporters will object that dual-use technology sales will still be made by other countries. New procedures for review of the Defense Department's licensing decisions at the presidential level are needed to address this concern. The USTR, as the President's trade envoy, would be able to address these problems in trade policy and work to stop foreign export sales of dual-use technology.<i>35</i>
<p>
<b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><br>
The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) was created by executive order in 1971 to help promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to show these businesses how to secure government contracts. The MBDA also provides funds for numerous Minority Business Development Centers (MBDCs) and American Indian Development Centers (IBDCs). Congress appropriated nearly $45 million for this program in fiscal 1995.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>  
Congress should close down the Minority Business Development Agency.<i>36</i> Although hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on the MBDA since 1971, it has never been authorized formally by Congress. The MBDA's stated objective is to show businesses how to get government contracts, which is hardly the best way to encourage minority business development. Its approach merely duplicates the efforts of the failed 8(a) loan program of the Small Business Administration. Numerous reports have criticized this kind of preference program lending, finding that many of the small businesses favored by these kinds of programs are never able to stand alone without government assistance.<i>37</i>
<p>
In recent years, Congress has altered the MBDA's mission toward what is best described as corporate welfare, subsidizing high-technology firms and university research projects. These questionable expenditures duplicate dozens of other wasteful federal programs and seem little more than an attempt to justify the existence of an agency whose only rationale is dispensing special-interest funds.
<p>
The most effective way for Congress to help small minority-owned businesses would be to repeal labor regulations that generally frustrate small start-up firms and to amend the tax code to encourage investment in new small enterprises. In addition, minority firms serving the public sector would be helped by repeal of such discriminatory laws as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and Service Contract Act of 1965. These laws raise the costs of government construction and service contracts by requiring companies that bid for such contracts to file mountains of paperwork documenting that they pay their workers above-market wages. Larger firms, which tend not to be minority-owned, have the advantage in bidding on such contracts. Repealing these laws would create a level playing field, instantly making smaller firms more competitive.
<p>
<b>Travel and Tourism Administration</b><br>
Created in 1981, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) spends nearly $20 million per year supposedly to promote tourism and recreational activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material, and running regional marketing shows. The USTTA administers the Disaster Relief Financial Assistance Program, which supports tourism for states recently hit by natural disasters. A new program is "developing a regional and global understanding within Governments on the relation between tourism and the environment."<i>38</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should close down the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration.<i>39</i> There is no reason for the federal government to be involved in an activity already well handled by a vast private travel and tourism industry. In 1992, over 45 million foreign travelers visited the United States. These tourists spent more than $55 billion in this country, including $17 billion in fares to U.S. air carriers. 
<p>
Private industry thus has a significant financial interest in promoting tourism and does not need taxpayers to pay its advertising costs. The agency often works with private-sector organizations, including the Travel Industry Association of America, to organize events such as the "Discover America International Pow Wow" or the "Pow Wow Europe."  There is no justification for federal involvement in such commercial promotional activities, with taxpayer funds used to pay for normal business marketing costs. Tourist promotion should be organized by private-sector interests without taxpayer assistance. The federal government does not belong in the travel industry.
<p>
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</b><br>
The $2 billion-per-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was formed in 1970 to consolidate commercially oriented ocean resource activities housed in other government agencies. NOAA's non-weather-related programs include a broad range of unrelated activities, such as commercial fisheries management, endangered species protection, habitat management, and research projects.<i>40</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should (1) separate the National Weather Service from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), establishing it as an independent agency with its functions reduced to specialized data collection and emergency warning activities,<i>41</i> and (2) reduce by 50 percent all non-Weather Service NOAA funding over five years. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should be transferred to the current Department of Interior. Most functions of the National Ocean Service should be privatized, and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet should be closed down. To accomplish this, Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Return the functions performed by the National Marine Fisheries Service to what are now the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Coast Guard.<i>42</i>
<p>
<li>Impose fees on commercial and recreational fishing interests for fishing in federal waters. These fees should be sufficient to cover the costs associated with managing federal fishing stocks.
<p>
<li>Privatize most National Ocean Service functions.
<p>
<li>Terminate the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet.<i>43</i>
<p>
</ul>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) consumes nearly 60 percent of the budget of the Department of Commerce and about 37 percent of its staff. NOAA oversees three significant non-Weather Service agencies:  the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the National Ocean Service (NOS), and the NOAA Corps and NOAA Fleet. Many functions of these programs can be moved to other agencies, terminated, privatized, or turned over to the states.
<p>
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the primary agency managing marine mammal and commercial fisheries resources in federal marine waters. Savings can be achieved by transferring NMFS fisheries and protected species management activities to the Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. NMFS fisheries monitoring and enforcement activities can be transferred to the Coast Guard, which already has policing powers over federal waters. Specific fisheries management functions can be transferred to the regional councils in New England, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf states. Federal funding should be ended for state fisheries grants, commercial fisheries promotion and development programs, and aquaculture research. The seafood inspection program could be transferred to the FDA inspection program.
<p>
Currently, unlike commercial interests that use public lands and extract minerals, the commercial and recreational fishing industries pay nothing for the right to fish in federal waters. Because these resources are considered free, and because the industry is overcapitalized as the result of government loan and fishing vessel construction programs, the federal fishing stock is rapidly becoming depleted. Indeed, the government has paid millions in income supplements to Northeast fisherman who have seen their profits fall due to depleted stocks. It also spends millions on fisheries recovery programs, stock surveys, and hatcheries. The industry that benefits from these programs contributes nothing to their cost.
<p>
Charging commercial and recreational fishing interests a fee or requiring them to pay a royalty to the federal government would place a premium on fishing in federal waters. Such a fee system would help defray the cost of resource management and a smaller fishing fleet would reduce the stress placed on federal fishing stocks that has forced a moratorium on fishing from many ports.
<p>
The National Ocean Service (NOS) engages in such diverse activities as mapping and charting, oil spill research, coastal monitoring, and marine sanctuary management. Savings can be achieved by privatizing the agency's navigational and aeronautical charting and mapping activities currently performed by its National Geodetic Survey office.<i>44</i> The Geodetic Survey has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, created by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 to chart navigational routes. There already are private companies drafting and marketing aeronautical services. Those activities that cannot be privatized should be transferred to the Coast Guard.
<p>
In addition, all regional coastal management programs, such as the $45 million Coastal Zone Management grant program and the $1 million Charleston area management plan, should be terminated and continued by state authorities if they choose to do so. Marine sanctuary programs can be merged into the Department of Interior or transferred to state governments.
<p>
The NOAA Corps also has its origins in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Today the Corps operates a fleet of 18 research vessels, as well as ten fixed-wing aircraft and four helicopters. All of these functions should be terminated. The NOAA Corps is outmoded, and its research fleet, reports the GAO, is "old and technologically obsolete."  NOAA is calling for a 15-year, $1.9 billion program to modernize and purchase 24 vessels but "has no assurance that its fleet modernization plan represents the most cost-effective means of meeting future program requirements."<i>45</i>  Many of the Corps' charting activities are duplicated by private companies or the Coast Guard and need not be continued; its ships should be given to universities and marine research centers, and its aircraft to the Air Force. Hurricane research now can be performed entirely through satellites.
<p>
<b>National Weather Service</b><br>
The primary function of the National Weather Service (NWS) is to issue warnings of severe weather and floods in order to minimize life and property loss. The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service -- an NWS adjunct -- operates the satellites producing the data the NWS uses to conduct its forecasts. The combined budgets of these programs comprise over half of NOAA's nearly $2 billion annual budget.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br> 
Congress should reduce funding for the National Weather Service by 50 percent over three years. The Weather Service should reduce its role by specializing in data collection and emergency warning efforts. NOAA's satellite program could be merged with the redundant Air Force weather satellite program. An assessment then should be made of the possibility of privatizing polar-orbiting satellites and information distribution functions.<i>46</i>
<P>
Due to mismanagement and bureaucratic inefficiencies, the reputation of the National Weather Service is under fire. For example, according to the General Accounting Office, its modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<i>47</i> The only way to salvage this program is to reduce it to its core functions and introduce a significant dose of competition and private-sector capital.
<p>
Many functions of the Weather Service should be contracted out to private firms or simply transferred to the private sector. There are now approximately 300 private companies in the U.S. preparing and disseminating weather forecasts to businesses and the public on a commercial basis. According to the Commercial Weather Services Association, "private meteorologists and for-profit companies provide the public upwards of 85 percent of its weather forecasts, through television weathercasts, in newspaper weather maps, and on radio."<i>48</i>
<p>
The Weather Service should turn over to private firms its specialized services, such as fruit frost and agricultural forecasting, aviation forecasting, and fire weather forecasting, and privatize or close the regional climate centers that compete directly with private firms.<i>49</i> In addition, the Service spends about $200 million per year in "fringe" weather operations -- such as Seasonal to Interannual Climate Forecasts and Decadal to Centennial Change -- which have little scientific validity and no practical value. These should be terminated.
<p>
The Service's field structure should be consolidated. The NWS has five headquarters offices, six regional offices, four national centers, and 334 field offices. This field office structure was designed when technology did not allow instant communication. Little has been done to alter this outmoded structure. Reducing these offices to no more than 25 facilities would save millions each year.
<p>
The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes privatizing such specialized NWS services as aviation, marine, and agricultural forecasting. The Office of Management and Budget projects these measures will save $40 million over five years. These recommendations are a small but good beginning.
<p>
<b>Patent and Trademark Office</b><br>
The patent system was established by the first Congress "to promote the progress of the useful arts" under Article I, Section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. The registration of trademarks was first authorized in 1870. About 110,000 patents and about 69,700 trademarks were registered for fiscal 1992 alone, and 5,700 trademark registrations were renewed. A substantial portion of the annual Patent Office budget is funded by fees and other payments for publication and services by the public.
<p>
<br>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
Section 205 of the Chrysler-Abraham legislation places the Patent and Trademark Office under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department. Other alternatives also have been proposed. Representative Carlos J. Moorhead (R-CA) has introduced legislation<i>50</i> to establish an independent government corporation, an idea favored by the American Bar Association's Section on Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law.<i>51</i> An independent corporation, as proposed by the ABA, is clearly superior because this function can be fully self-financing. Documenting the ownership of patent and trademark rights is an activity that provides specific economic value to private parties, who can enforce these rights in civil lawsuits.
<p>
<b>Technology Administration (Office of Technology Policy)</b><br>
The Technology Administration (TA) was created in 1988 as a successor to the Office of Productivity, Technology, and Innovation. This program oversees the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which are intended to promote commercially useable technology through research grants and subsidies. The office of the Undersecretary for Technology is an example of administrative overhead that can be eliminated by dismantling the Department of Commerce. The Undersecretary for Technology exercises executive and policy direction over the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technological Information Service, which is one of the largest publishing firms in the United States. The principal functions of the office, however, are to send representatives to interdepartmental meetings throughout the federal government and to supervise public relations activities, such as the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p> 
Congress should close down the Technology Administration. The National Technical Information Service should be closed or privatized. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program, in addition to the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships program,<i>52</i> also should be abolished. The technology programs represent most clearly the failed theories of government-industry "partnership," in which bureaucrats pick projects to subsidize and encourage private-sector interests to pursue government funding rather than to invest in entrepreneurial research. The House of Representatives has voted to discontinue funding for the Advanced Technology Program.<i>53</i>
<p>
<b>National Technical Information Service</b><br>
The National Technical Information Service is a publishing firm within the federal government which collects and disseminates scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by government and foreign sources. It provides databases and other computer services to private-sector and governmental clients and essentially covers its costs by setting prices for its publications and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should privatize the National Technical Information Service. The NTIS is required by law to pay its own costs and usually does so. This Commerce Department program is essentially a publishing business which already prices its products and services to those who benefit from them. Since it has proven itself able to operate in a businesslike way on its own, it should be privatized immediately.
<p>
<b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b><br>
Most of Commerce's recent growth in spending is due to increases in the budget for industrial policy funding of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Overall, outlays for NIST are scheduled under current law to skyrocket from $167 million in FY 1994 to $466 million in FY 1995 -- a 180 percent increase in one year. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget proposes that outlays for NIST nearly double by FY 1997, to $1.02 billion.
<p>
NIST's primary role is to promote commercial research and development projects. It carries out this mission through research projects and grant programs such as the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships(MEPs).<i>54</i> In FY 1996, the Clinton Administration proposes a 622 percent increase in budget authority for ATP, when compared with 1993 levels. MEP budget authority will jump by 716 percent over the same period under the Administration proposal. NIST, once called the National Bureau of Standards, also sets industry standards for various technological goods and services.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b><br>
Congress should close down the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This means ending NIST's Advanced Technology Program and its Scientific and Technical Research and Services, in addition to halting construction of new NIST research facilities. Weights and measures and other standards can be supervised by the National Academy of Engineering.
<p>
Although the Clinton Administration and many in Congress believe industrial policy initiatives like NIST are the key to America's competitive success, the exact opposite is true. Industrial policy programs rarely encourage the development of vibrant new industries, and when they do it is usually at very high cost. More important, NIST already shows signs of becoming one of the federal government's leading high-technology pork-barrel programs, replacing highway and other infrastructure programs. 
<p>
NIST should be abolished before any more harm is done to the economy and before any more taxpayer dollars are distributed wastefully to favored interest groups. Its research programs and facilities could be privatized very quickly. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, notes that such transformations have been proved successful even for organizations funded exclusively with federal money. White argues that privatization of federal R&D labs makes sense because, "With their new freedom to pursue research in whatever areas the market demands -- rather than just fulfilling government missions -- these laboratories might, if successful, spin-off companies and attract new businesses at a far greater rate than they do today. Research universities and private R&D companies with less governmental direction of their activities tend to contribute significantly to their region's economies."<i>55</i>
<p>
<b>National Telecommunications and Information Administration</b><br>
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) jointly manages the electromagnetic spectrum with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The NTIA also gives Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) grants to public television and radio organizations to help expand the audience for public programming. The newest NTIA promotional effort, the National Information Infrastructure (NII), hopes to channel funds into various "information highway" projects. Although an estimated $70 million - $100 million is to be spent on such projects in 1995, the Administration has set higher funding goals of $1 billion - $2 billion annually for future years.<i>56</i>
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p>
Congress should cut by 75 percent the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and transfer the remaining functions (those concerning oversight of public bands of the radio spectrum) to the Federal Communications Commission.<i>57</i> These functions then would be phased out with the FCC as the entire spectrum is privatized.
<p>
Efforts like the Public Telecommunications Facilities and Information Infrastructure programs are little more than high-technology pork projects. But whether it is spectrum management or public programming promotional efforts, the NTIA has little reason to be independent from the FCC. Communications policy should be embodied in one agency to minimize duplication and cut costs. Hence, all current NTIA tasks, after funding has been reduced 75 percent, should be transferred to the FCC. In addition, Congress should not allow the FCC to use the transfer of authority as an excuse to increase its budget. This should encourage the FCC to reform and simplify federal spectrum management policies, which are inefficient and discourage the advance of telecommunications competition.<i>58</i> Congress's goal should be to place all spectrum into private hands as rapidly as possible, abolish the FCC, and transfer responsibility under international spectrum management treaties to the State Department.

<p>
	Consolidating federal job training programs and giving the funds to the states in the form of block grants is a major part of the Senate welfare reform debate. Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better-paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately, they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work? 
<p>
	Job training programs, although well-intentioned, have not proven effective in raising the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal -- better-paying jobs -- because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.1 What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these two goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.<p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few rigorous studies that have been conducted generally fail to show that job training significantly increases long-term hourly earnings. Process-based performance measures traditionally have been the easier, but inappropriate, method for determining whether these programs work. But performance measures can be manipulated easily to explain away poor results by those with an interest in holding on to federal job training money. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.2 Without these studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>

<b>FEW STUDIES AND DISMAL RESULTS</b>
<p>
	Federal and state job training programs are intended to enable participants to build productive skills that will provide them with higher real wages. Only a few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluations, and the results show a record of failure.3 As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."4  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training.<p>A national controlled scientific study of the Title II-A programs of the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) reported these dismal findings:5<P><ul><li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on either the average earnings of young females or their employment.

<li>	The program had a large (7.9 percent) negative effect on the earnings of young males and no effect on their employment.

<li>	The program had no statistically significant effect on the average earnings of adult men.

<li>	Although the overall program had a small (3.4 percent) effect on the average hourly wage of adult women, classroom training did not have any statistically significant effect. Further, training for those adult women that received welfare or were high school dropouts had no statistically significant effect on earnings.

<li>	Immediate placement in a job did have a small effect on earnings, but not on higher hourly wages. The increase in earnings was due primarily to working more hours rather than to higher hourly wages.
</ul><p>
Further, in 1991 the General Accounting Office found that the majority of service delivery areas underreported administrative expenditures, resulting in a misrepresentation of program costs and amounting to a circumvention of the statutory limitation placed on administrative costs.6 <p>A controlled scientific study of the Summer Training and Employment Program (STEP) reported these disappointing findings:7<p><ul><li>	After two to three years, STEP graduates did not have higher graduation rates or grades than the control group.	<li>Graduates of STEP were no more likely to be working than the control group.</ul><p>A scientific control group study of the Job Corps, one of the most expensive job training programs, has never been conducted. However, a 1982 quasi-experimental study found these results:8  <p><ul><li>	Job Corps did not significantly help single mothers (the largest number of welfare recipients).<li>	Job Corps did not affect the overall arrest rate.<li>	Further, a report by the Department of Labor's Inspector General found that only 17 percent of the Job Corps funding went to educational and vocational training, compared to 26 percent for administration.9 A study by the General Accounting Office also raised "serious concerns about the validity of job placement information."10  The GAO was unable to verify job placement for 15 percent of their Job Corps sample. After 30 years and billions of dollars spent, this program has never been subject to rigorous evaluation and only recently has begun to determine the employment status of Job Corps students.11</ul><p>A controlled scientific study of the Jobstart program also reported disappointing findings:12<p><ul><li>	There was no significant increase in overall employment or earnings for the total four-year study period or for any individual year.

<li>	The program did not reduce welfare receipt.

<li>	Jobstart did not affect overall arrest rates.

A controlled study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration program reported only very small improvements in earnings:13<P><ul><li>	This demonstration project clearly indicates there are incentives associated with reducing welfare benefits to single mothers who do not stay in school or get a job. AFDC grants were reduced by $160 for those who chose not to participate.

<li>	There was only a small increase in average earnings per year, about $300 to $700, and after five years there was no difference in earnings between the control group and the group that participated in the program.

<li>	In most cases the increases in literacy skills and educational attainment did not translate into increased earnings or employment.15</ul><p>A study by the General Accounting Office also found that the Department of Health and Human Services "does not know whether JOBS is reducing welfare dependency because it does not gather enough information on critical program outcomes."16<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	After 30 years, thousands of local job training programs, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, only a few dozen job training programs have been subject to rigorous evaluation. The few studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant long-term increase in hourly earnings directly related to job training. Performance measures and benchmarks are easy but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. They are easily manipulated and explained away. If federal funding for job training is to continue, rigorous control group studies of these programs must be required.
<p>
	One thing is clear from the few studies that have been done:  Government can do little, if anything, to alter the effect of neglecting the first 12 years of school.
<p>
	The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much, too late. What is needed are fundamental changes aimed at reducing illegitimacy and encouraging individuals to complete high school. In addition, parents need to make their children stay in school, do their homework, stay out of trouble, and graduate from high school. Welfare reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for expensive government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Job placement assistance may speed up the transition from welfare to work and increase the number of hours worked per year, but that is entirely different from the primary purpose of training: better-paying jobs.
<li>The job training block grant in the Work Opportunity Act of 1995 (S. 1120) improves state accountability by requiring performance measures on the employment outcome of program participants, but it does not require control group evaluation studies.<li>The only method for evaluating job training programs effectively is to conduct an experimental design study that randomly assigns individuals either to a treatment group that can receive services from the program under study or to a control group that cannot, and then evaluate the outcomes.

<title>Abolish The Department of Commerce -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Abolish the Department of  Commerce: <br>
Move the Undersecretary for International Trade to the Treasury Department</h3></i>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #425<br>
August 14, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%><p> </center>
	The legislation in Congress to dismantle the Department of Commerce (DOC) has raised concerns about how necessary functions currently performed by the department will be preserved. Business leaders in particular have expressed concern about protecting U.S. interests in international trade. Although the idea of creating a new Cabinet-level Department of International Trade is gaining momentum, it would not reduce the size of the Cabinet. Responding to the concerns of the business community about U.S. trade policy need not conflict with the initial goal of dismantling Cabinet agencies and reducing the size and scope of government. A more effective solution is to transfer international trade functions to the Treasury Department.
<p>
	<b>Re-examine the Initial Proposal.</b> Section 204 of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act transfers international trade functions of the Department of Commerce to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The USTR is an extremely effective agency within the Executive Office of the President, with fewer than 170 employees. It conducts all trade negotiations and represents the United States in the World Trade Organization. A major reorganization of the USTR would be required to place more than 2,500 Commerce Department employees there. The USTR's mission would change dramatically from trade policy negotiation, closely linked to the President's role as a world economic leader, to enforcement of U.S. trade laws and promotion of exports.
<p>
	The prospect of such a major change in the USTR has revived interest in a proposal introduced in previous years to create a Cabinet-level Department of International Trade. Representative John L. Mica (R-FL) has introduced legislation to establish a new U.S. Trade Administration, headed by a "U.S. Trade Representative" but actually performing the functions of a Cabinet department. The current role performed by the USTR would be performed by a Deputy USTR for Negotiations within the new department. Representative Mica argues that "a new cabinet department" is not being established because the current USTR already enjoys "cabinet status."  But moving the USTR out of the Executive Office of the President into a new agency, like the corresponding demotion to "deputy" status of the actual negotiators of trade agreements, suggests the contrary.
<p>
	Creating a new Cabinet-level department to replace the USTR is not only contrary to the intent of Congress in the budget resolution, but also would change completely the USTR's function in American trade policy. The President's trade negotiator has always worked directly with the highest ranking officers of other governments and has been most effective as the personal envoy of the head of state. In recent years, direct meetings between heads of state have played an increasing role in international economic relations. The Executive Office of the President requires a negotiation team like the USTR. Insulating trade policy development from the subsequent administration of trade agreements and other political concerns gives the USTR a necessary flexibility in resolving disputes with foreign governments that is quite different from the routine administrative methods of government bureaucracies.
<p>
	<b>Create an Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade.</b> Congress should transfer Department of Commerce trade policy and trade law enforcement activities to the Treasury Department. An Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade should be created to assume all functions of the present Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. The new Treasury Undersecretary would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department, and the trade functions would complement and reinforce the Treasury Department's current role as the principal agency for international economic policy. There should be no change in the duties of the current Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
<p>
	The Secretary of the Treasury is the government's principal officer for international economic policy. The Treasury Department now has exclusive jurisdiction over all U.S. international economic relations, except trade policy, so the Secretary of Commerce is perceived abroad as a minor Cabinet officer. Except for the President, the Treasury Secretary has always been the chief spokesman for U.S. economic interests internationally. The more central role assumed by trade policy in the post-Cold War era requires greater coordination with other international economic functions -- a magnification of influence that only a Treasury Secretary can bring.
<p>
	To elevate the importance of enforcing U.S. international trade agreements -- which is a central concern of both U.S. exporters and domestic industries -- the Secretary of the Treasury should be given clear authority for all international economic functions. The Treasury Department is currently responsible for all enforcement relating to taxation of transnational corporations, which has important trade-related consequences. The Customs Service, within Treasury, is the enforcement agency for any trade regulations issued by the Commerce Department. As international trade grows, an increasing share consists of intermediate products and semifinished goods. This raises questions concerning the correct invoicing of these imports and exports both for determining taxable U.S. income and for accurately measuring the value of trade. The growing problem of fraudulent invoicing of traded goods affects taxation, balance of payments, and money laundering violations -- all of which are Treasury Department concerns.
<p>
	Any new trade agency outside the Treasury Department would fail to carry the authority that trade policy requires. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet. As a part of the Treasury Department, international trade issues would have the same relative status within a Cabinet department as they now enjoy, but an Undersecretary in the principal agency for international economic policy would have more influence in the administration.
<p>
	<b>Improve the Administration of U.S. Trade Policy.</b> During the Carter Administration, Congress transferred responsibility for trade policy from the Treasury Department to a new International Trade Administration in Commerce because the Secretary of the Treasury had not corrected a number of problems. Most important, the Department failed to define and delegate responsibilities for administering U.S. trade laws effectively. The Treasury Department was unenthusiastic about enforcing textile and steel quotas, to the dismay of those industries and their supporters in Congress. The 1994 GATT Uruguay Agreement on textile quotas and other non-tariff trade barriers has removed those concerns. Today, a transfer -- without substantial reorganization -- of the position of Undersecretary of International Trade to the Treasury Department would protect and enhance U.S. interests in international trade by preserving a clear line of authority for administering U.S. trade laws and giving it more prominent Cabinet status.
<P>
	<B>What Congress Should Do.</B> Export and import concerns should continue to occupy a priority position in the President's Cabinet, and the role of the USTR should not be diminished by any administrative reorganization. Congress should reject any proposals to create a new Cabinet-level international trade department. It would remain a minor voice in the Cabinet and would not carry the same authority internationally as the Treasury Department. The American people would see through the "shell game" nature of any such exercise and question the commitment of Congress to reducing the size of government. The Clinton Administration would be handed a strong argument for vetoing the entire reorganization proposal. Establishing a new Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Trade responsible for all current functions of the Commerce Undersecretary would address these problems and strengthen the administration of U.S. trade policy.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Transportation -- Heritage </title>

<h2>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</h2>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder #1048<br>
August 17, 1995
<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
<p></center>
INTRODUCTION<b> 1</b>
<p>
The U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) was created in 1966 by consolidating several independent agencies devoted to specific transportation sectors, chiefly the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration, into a new Cabinet-level department. Also included in the new department were several transportation-related divisions from other departments, such as the Coast Guard (which had been at the Department of Commerce), together with newly established federal responsibilities for mass transit under the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964. In 1970, DOT added interstate passenger rail service to its duties when it took over money-losing passenger routes from private railroads and reorganized them as money-losing Amtrak. Several years later, for a brief period, the department was home to Conrail, a collection of bankrupt rail freight lines in the Northeast, which soon became one of the few federal privatization successes.
<p>
For this fiscal year, federal spending on transportation is budgeted at just over $39 billion. Nearly half -- $19 billion -- will be spent on highways, while roughly 25 percent -- $10 billion -- will be spent on aviation, primarily air traffic control operations and airport grants. Much of the department's spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished by the federal fuel tax that every consumer pays when he fills up his tank, and the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket tax and several lesser aviation user taxes.
<p>
Largely unchanged in structure and purpose since its creation in 1966, DOT has been the object of a number of recent reform proposals, including a recommendation by the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review that it be overhauled. Several of these proposed reforms, such as "corporatization" of the air traffic control system and consolidation of many surface transportation programs into infrastructure block grants that would be provided to the states, were part of the FY 1996 federal budget. At the same time, the Administration proposed to reduce slightly the amount of money the federal government spends on transportation over the next several years. 
<p>
These relatively modest reforms met with considerable opposition even among House Republicans, who wanted to maintain much of the nearly $40 billion the federal government spends on transportation each year. Fortunately, Senate Republicans have been more committed to fundamental reform, and this was represented in the House/Senate conference agreement on the FY 1996 budget resolution. Though somewhat vague on critical points, the conference report did commit Congress to downsizing and streamlining DOT, and even recommended privatization of the air traffic control system -- in contrast to the House Republicans' initial proposal to keep it as a government bureaucracy. The report, noting that the nation's infrastructure needs are not being met by the current centralized command structure, also urged greater privatization and federalism.
<p>
Specifically, the conference report proposes to phase out Amtrak, which will be cut by $205 million from last year, and mass transit operating subsidies, which will be cut by $300 million. Other areas of transportation, however, receive substantial increases. Spending on highways would rise a staggering $880 million over last year, while $660 million will be provided to start 30 new transit systems, most of which will be in light rail, the least cost-effective of the options available to Americans. This reflects a $19 million increase over last year's new start spending, and is significantly more than President Clinton recommended in proposing only 12 new transit starts in his 1996 budget.
<p>
This reluctance to impose fiscal discipline is troubling. Even worse is the record the House is compiling in attempting to reform the restrictive labor practices past Congresses have forced on Amtrak and local transit systems, as well as Davis-Bacon Act provisions affecting highways. In July, efforts to reform costly labor practices and mandates on mass transit and Amtrak were defeated overwhelmingly as many House Republicans joined with Democrats to vote down every reform proposal put forward as part of the transportation appropriations bill.
<p>
Although too modest in scope, the Clinton Administration's proposals could help reinvigorate the process of fundamental transportation reform that began with President Carter and carried over into the early Reagan Administration, and the House/Senate conference report at least includes general endorsements of reform, decentralization, and privatization. The Administration's proposals implicitly recognize that DOT's duties are largely commercial in nature and might better be left to the states or to the private sector. In the past, the federal government often helped facilitate the more rapid commercialization of a new technology (aviation) or a new concept (limited-access interstate highways). Generally, however, the Department has simply preserved, at considerable taxpayer expense, such inefficient transportation concepts as urban mass transit monopolies or poorly managed interstate passenger rail service. Despite its early successes in highways and aviation, federal involvement in these areas has become costly, bureaucratic, and inflexible, operating in a fashion that preserves the privileges of businesses, civil servants, congressional committees, and unions that benefit financially from the status quo.
<p>
It is time for Congress to recognize that continued federal involvement in transportation is an inefficient use of society's scarce resources. To decrease the costs and decentralize the management of America's transportation system, the Department of Transportation should be closed down, and most of today's federal transportation responsibilities should be returned to individual states, local communities, or the private sector. Such actions would have the effect of continuing the successful transportation policies of the late Carter Administration and early Reagan Administration, when airlines, interstate rail freight, trucking, and the moving industry were deregulated to the considerable benefit of America's consumers, workers, and businesses.
<p>
Specifically, Congress needs to institute major reforms in several areas of transportation policy:
<p>
<b>Surface Transportation</b><br> 
Congress should return to the states much of the responsibility, with the necessary resources, to operate and fund those transportation functions that are the province of government. Most transportation concerns are local in nature, and continuing to force politically influenced, centralized solutions on local problems will be no more successful in the future than it has been in the past.
<p>
Today, the federal government determines how much will be spent on transportation infrastructure, raises the money, and then decides how it will be distributed and divided among the many different forms of transport -- such as highways, mass transit, aviation, and rail passenger services -- in accordance with a central plan developed by the DOT, Congress, and the states and influenced by the many private industries that depend on federal grants and contracts. Costly strings are attached to these funds in the form of dozens of mandates, directives, and special set-asides to satisfy certain constituencies. 
<p>
Congress can reverse this process in 1997 when the legislation authorizing the DOT's largest program -- the Highway Trust Fund -- and the taxes that support it expires. Funded with an 11.5 cent share of the 18.4 cent per gallon federal gas tax, the trust fund each year takes in and disburses approximately $20 billion on highways, bridges, and mass transit initiatives. The program should be allowed to expire as scheduled so the states can assume this relinquished taxing authority to fund their own transportation programs. As an interim step, all the money collected by the federal government through the fuel tax should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in exact proportion to the amount collected in each state. The accumulated balance in the trust fund, now approaching $18 billion, should be returned to the states in proportion to the amount paid in once the federal budget reaches balance, as scheduled, in the year 2002.
<p>
This block grant would be unrestricted except for a requirement that it be used for transportation, with each state free to distribute the funds among a variety of transportation purposes that best suit its needs. For states needing rail passenger service, a portion of the funds could be used to maintain some or all of the lines that formerly were part of Amtrak. For heavily urbanized states, funds could support mass transit beyond revenues generated by fares. And for most states, most of the money would continue to support highway and bridge programs. After 1997, when the federal fuel tax author-ity expires, states could assume responsibility for the tax <b>2</b> or could develop other funding mechanisms, including taxes, user fees, greater private investor participation, and tolls, to maintain and sustain their own transportation program.
<p>
<b>The End of Mandates</b><br> 
Also terminated should be the large and costly collection of federal mandates, regulations, and prohibitions that have inflated state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative, low-cost transportation solutions. Mandates associated with federal highway funds force states to incur additional costs that may equal as much as 80 percent of the federal funds received. For the federal transit programs, the costs of fulfilling federal mandates can be two to three times the value of the federal subsidy. Ending these mandates would increase substantially the buying power of a transportation block grant, and eliminating the many federal restrictions discouraging states from forming partnerships with private investors to develop or rehabilitate highways and bridges would allow states open access to substantial pools of private development capital. 
<p>
<b>Urban Mass Transit</b><br> 
The most important action Congress can take to reform surface transportation is to terminate the Federal Transit Administration, the most wasteful and counterproductive of all DOT programs. Federal spending on local transit initiatives runs in excess of $4 billion per year, part of which is financed from the 1.5 cent share of the federal fuel tax. Urban and community transit programs are almost entirely local in nature, have few (if any) national ramifications, and derive only about five percent of their operating funds from the federal government. But because of federal mandates, including costly provisions that directly benefit organized labor, the hidden cost to the community may be two to three times higher than the value of the subsidy itself. Thus, all existing federal transit legislation also should be amended to remove all federally imposed mandates and restrictive labor practices. Once the program is terminated and the laws amended, states would be free to fund mass transit programs through the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<b>Amtrak</b><br> 
As part of a comprehensive reform of DOT surface transportation programs, all federal funding to Amtrak should end and Amtrak's management should be encouraged to work with interested and affected states to develop creative ways to maintain cost-efficient service. States could use a portion of the new transportation block grant to maintain some local or regional rail service in cooperation with other states and Amtrak, or its successor entity. To this end, the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 should be amended to eliminate excessive labor protections and Amtrak's federally enforced monopoly status. In addition, an eight-state compact to maintain and fund operations in the Northeast Corridor should be pre-approved by Congress and the formal transfer of assets (rolling stock, road bed, stations) to the new consortium included in the legislation terminating Amtrak. Popular long-haul routes should be privatized separately to take better advantage of their tourism potential. 
<p>
<b>Aviation</b><br> 
DOT aviation programs, operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and financed largely from the airport trust fund, should be privatized (in the case of air traffic control) or fully devolved to the states (airports). Aviation safety responsibilities should remain with the federal government in a new transportation safety agency. Specifically, and similar to proposals of the Senate Budget Committee, the National Performance Review, and the Clinton Administration, the FAA should be split into three parts. The air traffic control system should be reorganized as an independent government corporation, funded by direct user fees, and ultimately privatized; the airport improvement program, and the taxes and fees that fund it, should be turned over to the states and localities. Meanwhile, the safety, licensing, inspection and training functions of the FAA should be carried out either by an independent federal aviation safety agency or by a new government agency that also deals with safety issues related to highways, boats, rail, and other forms of transportation.
<p>
As part of this change, the airport trust fund, with a balance now in excess of $12 billion, should be dissolved and the federal passenger ticket tax ended. A portion of the balance could be used to fund some of the potentially high transition costs involved in privatizing the air traffic control system and to honor existing commitments under the airport improvement program. Once the federal budget is balanced, the remaining funds could be returned to existing airport authorities in proportion to ticket taxes previously collected.
<p>
Existing federal laws, mandates, and prohibitions governing airports should be amended or eliminated to allow greater freedom for airport managers and more private sector participation in airport ownership, construction, development, and management. With these mandates ended, airports would be free to establish their own charges, fees, or taxes on aircraft or passengers in order to fund ongoing operations and improvements.
<p>
<b>The Coast Guard</b><br> 
The Coast Guard's chief responsibilities now focus largely on law enforcement. Congress therefore should transfer the Coast Guard and its coastal security and interdiction functions to the Department of Justice, so that its activities can be coordinated more effectively with those of other federal law enforcement agencies. Other, less pressing duties could be shifted to the private sector, the states, or other agencies. Basic rescue responsibilities, for example, could be turned over to existing private competitors and volunteer organizations, with government retaining responsibility only in the event of extreme emergencies and severe weather conditions beyond the scope and resources of the private sector. Boat safety responsibilities should devolve to the states, where most other transport safety issues already are lodged. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take over the Coast Guard's anti-pollution responsibilities, and states or regional authorities should assume responsibility for maintaining navigational aids, policing waterways, and icebreaking.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be terminated except for its international regulatory roles, which should be transferred to the Department of State or the U.S. Trade Representative. Safety functions and responsibilities should be retained in an independent federal agency. The Maritime Administration and Congress's long, counterproductive interference with the ocean shipping industry have succeeded only in destroying America's once proud maritime heritage. The price, in addition to considerable taxpayer expense, has been the loss of thousands of jobs.
<p>
<br>
<b>FEDERAL HIGHWAY PROGRAM</b><br>
Today's federal highway programs began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1944 Federal Highway Aid Act which earmarked $1.6 billion for highways over three years, and Dwight D. Eisenhower's Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956. The former created the federal responsibility; the latter shaped the program that exists today. Specifically, the 1956 Act called for completion of a 41,000-mile interstate highway system by 1972 and created the Highway Trust Fund, financed by a federal excise tax on gasoline, as a long-term source of federal funds for road construction. 
<p>
Congress originally intended the highway program to be a federally assisted state program.<b>3</b> But over time, as more and more federal mandates and money have been added, it has become a state-assisted federal program. A $30 billion program with a fifteen-year projected time for completion has incurred costs of more than $300 billion and is now thirty years behind schedule.
<p>
Although the broad objectives of federal involvement have been met, the federal highway program, operating out of Washington as a centrally managed monopoly incorporating the ideas and transportation concepts of the 1950s, is no longer what America needs. It also is no longer consistent with the original intent of a federally funded state program. With the national highway system largely completed, and with existing and emerging surface transportation issues predominantly local or regional in nature, a centralized, one-size-fits-all program makes little fiscal, management, or creative sense.
<p>
<b>Unresponsive and Bureaucratic.</b> The principal weakness in the current federal system is its centralized allocation of financial resources according to mechanical formulas based more on political influence than on transportation needs. Money collected at the state level from individual drivers whenever they fill their gas tanks is funneled to Washington, where a little less than two-thirds is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund for reallocation back to the states for a variety of federally determined purposes in federally determined proportions. 
<p>
Of the 18.4 cents per gallon now paid at the pump in federal excise taxes, only 10 cents goes to highways. Of the remainder, 1.5 cents goes to mass transit, 0.1 cents to cleaning up leaking storage tanks, and 6.8 cents to the government generally. On October 1, 1995, the highway dedication will rise by 20 percent to 12 cents per gallon and the transit dedication will rise by one-third to 2 cents per gallon. These increases will be financed by reducing the 6.8 cent highway tax support for general government (no overall tax increase will occur).<b>4</b> Similar diversions of tax funding from deficit reduction to highways and mass transit will occur at the same time with respect to other motor fuel taxes.
<p>
How much money each state receives from the fund is determined according to an elaborate mechanical formula which has left a trail of winners and losers. Since its inception in 1956, states such as Alaska and Hawaii, along with the District of Columbia, have received in grants substantially more than they have paid into the fund, while states such as South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin have received just over half the amount they have paid in fuel taxes.<b>5</b>
<p>
Once the aggregate allocation is determined, the money returned to the states is earmarked for specific types of projects as determined jointly by members and staff of key congressional committees and staff and officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In the 1995 budget, developed in cooperation with President Clinton and the 103rd Congress, $20.1 billion in federal highway aid was allocated in specific amounts to such programs as the national highway system, the surface transportation program, the bridge program, interstate completion, interstate maintenance, interstate substitutions, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement, intelligent vehicle highway systems, emergency relief, federal lands, administration and research (more than $700 million), demonstration projects, high priority corridors, highway-related safety grants, motor carrier safety grants, and miscellaneous appropriations of a quarter of a billion dollars for 80 specific highway projects mandated by Members of Congress for their states or districts.<b>6</b>
<p>
In addition to the predetermined allocations among the states and between specific types of highway projects, Washington determines how much and what types of urban mass transit assistance each state receives, how much passenger rail service is available to it and at what cost, and how much money will be provided for airport construction, improvement, and modernization.
<p>
<b>Miles of Red Tape.</b> In order to receive these predetermined funding allocations, states and local communities must agree to adhere to a growing list of mandates that substantially raise the cost of meeting transportation needs, thereby actually diminishing the amount of transport services that each federal dollar can buy. Chief among these counterproductive mandates are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Construction Wage Laws. The Davis-Bacon Act of 1932 requires that any project receiving federal funds must pay workers the area's "prevailing wage" as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. In most cases, this means above-market union wages and adds an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent to the cost of affected projects.<b>7</b>
<p>
<li>Environmental Regulations. Threatening to withhold federal highway funds is one way the Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with the DOT, frequently forces states to apply a variety of environmental regulations to car drivers. As a result of these threats and mandates, for example, drivers in certain areas of the country must undergo costly mandatory emissions inspections and switch seasonally to more costly and less efficient oxygenated fuels to reduce carbon monoxide emissions and photo-chemical smog to national standards established by the EPA. 
<p>
These substantial costs are forced on automobile owners despite the absence of conclusive epidemiological evidence that these emissions adversely affect human health. And while the health and environmental benefits of these and other regulations are uncertain and questionable, the financial benefits of the oxygenated fuels mandate to the ethanol industry are both substantial and obvious. In addition to these restrictions, new highway construction projects must be preceded by costly and time-consuming environmental impact statements.
<p>
<li>Safety Regulations. Similar threats have been used to require states to enforce costly safety initiatives, such as the recently repealed, federally mandated 55-mile-per-hour speed limit that added to costs, inconvenience, and congestion on the highways while making only a negligible contribution to decreased deaths, injuries, and property damage.<b>8</b> Such regulations have been wholly inappropriate and counterproductive to states, and regions within states, characterized by low population densities, as well as to regions where long-distance driving often is essential for employment and other day-to-day tasks.
<p>
<li>Miscellaneous Regulations and Mandates. Other federal requirements and mandates linked to federal highway funds include driver's license screening procedures for controlled substances, safety belt enforcement, drug-free workplace requirements, creating and maintaining a problem driver point system, commercial motor vehicle safety provisions, enforcement of the Truth in Mileage Act, requirements for minority business enterprise and women's business enterprise contracting, implementation of sound abatement barriers, bicycle paths and right of ways, metric conversion, establishment of an information data base system, hazardous waste operations, emergency response training programs, treatment of storm water runoff, compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act as it relates to recipients of federal grants, and utilization of pulverized, recycled rubber in highway paving and repaving materials. A recent study of the cost of highway-related federal mandates imposed on California concluded that California incurred expenses of $1.8 billion to fulfill these mandates so it could receive $2.3 billion in federal highway money. <b>9</b>
</ul>
<p>
<b>The Need to End Federal Limits and Prohibitions on Tolls and Private Investor Participation.</b> Among the most damaging federal requirements are the limits on the extent to which states can charge tolls and work in partnership with private-sector investors. Highways funded in whole or in part by the Highway Trust Fund may neither charge any tolls (except for a small number of Washington-approved demonstration projects) nor be developed or renovated with private investor participation. Thus, an opportunity to add significantly to the funds available for highway construction -- at no cost to the taxpayer -- is foregone, and America's ability to meet its transportation needs is held hostage to federal funding limits and allocations established by Congress and DOT staff. For example, an estimated 230,000 highway bridges need significant repair at a projected cost of $60 billion or more.<b>10</b> In this year's budget, the Clinton Administration requested just $2.6 billion in FY 1996 for bridges under the Federal Aid to Highways program, or just less than 5 percent of the estimated need.<b>11</b>
<p>
In addition to the unnecessary limits on resources that it creates, the prohibition on tolls precludes opportunities to contribute, however modestly, to the alleviation of congestion and the better utilization of existing transportation resources through market pricing mechanisms. For example, the major surface transportation issue in communities throughout the country is congestion, generally associated with commuting and rush hour travel. With existing highways offered to consumers (drivers) as a "free good," or at least as a pre-paid service, drivers have no financial incentive to alter their schedules or their mode of transportation so they might use this valuable asset more efficiently to minimize congestion. To induce drivers to alter their travel plans to diminish congestion during peak travel periods associated either with holidays or workday rush hours, tolls could be levied (or increased where they already exist) on specific bridges or highways, as appropriate. This would encourage some individuals to defer travel, to utilize an alternative mode of transportation such as public transit or car pools, or take a different route.
<p>
Such congestion pricing tolls have been implemented in several cities in Europe and Asia (for instance, Bergen, Oslo, and Singapore), and public transit systems in Washington, D.C., and several other U.S. cities charge a premium for rush hour travel on buses and subways to encourage riders to shift travel to off-peak times. Although by no means a panacea, there is no reason why this concept could not be applied selectively to auto travel in the United States in those places and along those routes where existing traffic patterns make it possible and where driving patterns may be sensitive to price incentives. Unfortunately, federal prohibitions and habit deter its use, so efforts are limited to public exhortations urging citizens to ride buses or join car pools. 
<p>
Until recently, placing tolls on congested urban roads and bridges was not always economically practical because the collection costs and ensuing delays would likely have worsened the situation. However, new technologies allow electronic assessment of tolls from moving cars and trucks, using inexpensive transponders or receivers mounted on the vehicles. In the United States such automated systems have been implemented on the Crescent City Connection 12-lane bridge in New Orleans, the 17-mile North Dallas Tollway,<b>12</b> and the Oklahoma toll road system.
<p>
Allowing for tolls creates opportunities for the private sector to develop and operate highways or to participate as partners with government in highway construction and operation. While private toll roads are common in Western Europe, and several are under construction (or planned) in several places in the U.S., their use has been limited severely by prohibitions and constraints at both the state and federal levels. Many states simply prohibit privately owned highways, while others tightly regulate them and require an elaborate and costly approval process. At the federal level, while there are no outright prohibitions on private highways, there have been tight controls on the extent to which private and public moneys can be commingled in infrastructure investments developed on a for-profit basis, and these controls have largely discouraged any private interest.<b>13</b>
<p>
At the same time, ambiguities regarding ownership of existing federally supported public roads, as well as federal anti-toll provisions, deter the creation of for-profit public/private partnerships that could rehabilitate, modernize, or widen -- at little or no taxpayer expense -- an existing public road that once received federal funding for some or all of its construction. Until very recently, there was no formal legal mechanism to allow for the sale or disposal of such highways, or to assess properly a reimbursement payment to offset the past federal investment. As a consequence, previously built highways in need of rehabilitation, modernization, and widening must wait their turn and compete politically with other highway projects for federal grant money. In recent years, executive orders promulgated by both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have resolved some, but not all, of these problems. 
<p>
Private-sector participation would allow some highway rehabilitation projects (particularly for well-traveled highways with restricted access) to receive immediate attention and financing at no cost to the taxpayer. A partnership could be formed between the state or local community and private investors, who would provide the funds to widen and resurface the aging highway to current standards and needs and be compensated for the effort, risk, and investment by receiving a portion of the tolls collected on the highway. The community's transportation needs would be addressed sooner and for less money (thanks in part to no federal red tape, which adds at least 20 percent to 30 percent to highway costs). Meanwhile, those who benefit the most -- the drivers who use the new road -- would pay for it in direct proportion to usage and benefits received.
<p>
Private highway projects currently are under construction in Virginia and California, and others are planned for Minnesota and Washington State. Private toll roads have long been in operation in France, Germany, and Italy and are underway in Argentina, Chile, China, Great Britain, Hong Kong, and Mexico.<b>14</b>
<p>
Although toll roads, including hundreds built and operated by private companies, played an important role in the early development of America's transportation infrastructure, the growing federalization of the highway system over the past forty years has discouraged and formally prohibited both private sector participation and the use of tolls on public roads. The rationale for this prohibition is thin and merits brief discussion. 
<p>
<b>Haven't We already Paid For It?</b> The chief argument used against tolls and highway privatization is that drivers already have paid for the highway through the federal fuel tax and Highway Trust Fund, which roughly relates taxes paid to highway usage. Under these circumstances, it is argued, any additional levies or user fees would be unfair and redundant. But this exaggerates the extent to which fuel taxes paid by individuals actually fund the highways, as well as the correspondence between costs incurred and benefits received. Further, it vastly overstates the ability of the user fee, as currently configured, to finance the U.S. highway and bridge system to the desired level of quality and capability.
<p>
A principal complaint about the existing user fee system is that less than 55 percent of the tax goes to highways, suggesting that any reference to the gas tax as a user fee is misleading. Further distorting the relationship between fees paid and benefits received is the fact that a disproportionate share of federal highway money goes to just 22 percent of U.S. road miles, which includes the interstate highway system and, to a lesser extent, its arterials and collectors. It does not include local roads, however, so auto owners whose driving is primarily local pay the federal fuel tax without receiving much in the way of direct benefits. 
<p>
In a similar vein, drivers who pay to use existing toll roads, such as the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Turnpikes or Interstate 95 between Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware, also pay the gas tax, yet are not eligible for a rebate due to double taxation. Indeed, the price of fuel sold on these toll roads includes the federal fuel tax. Also distorting the relationship between fees and benefits is the fact that while different types of vehicles impose significantly different costs on highways, these differences are not reflected properly in the fees they pay. Heavy trucks, for example, cause substantially more wear and tear than is covered by the various fees and taxes they pay.<b>15</b>
<p>
Thus, it is not true that bridge and highway tolls are unfair because they would distort the relationship between fees and usage. The addition of more road and bridge tolls dedicated exclusively to highway improvement actually would enhance the correspondence between what drivers pay and what they in turn receive.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li><b>Do not reauthorize the federal highway and transit program.</b>
<p> 
Federal motor fuel taxes should be allowed to expire as scheduled.<b>16</b> This would constitute complete and final devolution of the program to the states, which would finance their highway, transit, and leaking underground storage tank needs as they see fit (probably by increasing state motor fuels taxes or substituting a state fuel tax for the terminated federal fuel tax).
<p>
Abolish the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (49 USC app. 1651 note).
<p>
<li><b>Devolve the federal highway program to the states.</b> 
<p>
This would require repeal of Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with the exception of Sections 204, 205, 210, 212, 215, 216, and 218, and would comport with the original intent of the law that the federal highway program be a state program. Full devolution to the states is appropriate, since local governments are units of state government. Research programs would be financed by the states and by private-sector interests in the highway industry. 
<p>
Devolving the program would involve several actions:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Before the scheduled re-authorization, all federal motor fuel taxes dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund and the Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund should be returned to the states as a transportation block grant in proportion to their collection. 
<li>All federal mandates (funded, underfunded, and unfunded) should be removed. This could be accomplished by simple legislative language such as the following:<b>17</b> "Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, states shall have the right to waive any federal requirement in Title 23 and Title 49 Section 1601 et seq." 
<li>The returned funds should be subject to conventional state legislative and administrative procedures.<b>18</b>
<li>Return the balance in the Highway Trust Fund to the states from federal budget surpluses earned after the federal budget is balanced.<b>19</b>
<li>Disbursements should be based on a formula that reasonably approximates prior state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Establish an Office of Interstate Highway Cooperation.
<p>
This office could be created either as an independent agency or within a successor entity that absorbed remaining responsibilities of terminated or consolidated agencies. It would bring together state officials to deal with issues of coordination among the states (such as designation of interstate and USC highway numbers). Minimal funding would be required.
<p>
<li>Transfer International Programs to the Department of State (23 USC 212, 216, and 218).
<p>
Included in DOT are numerous transportation responsibilities with international ramifications, such as landing rights for air carriers, limits on fares, negotiated shipping rates, and safety issues. These matters could be handled better by the Department of State in coordination with other diplomatic issues.
<p>
<li>Transfer the Federal Lands Highway Program, forest development roads and trails highways, and territorial highway program to the Department of the Interior or its successor agency (49 USC 204, 205, and 215).
<p>
<li>Transfer defense access roads to the Department of Defense (49 USC 210).
<p>
<li>Terminate separate highway programs of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and consolidate these responsibilities into the proposed transportation block grant.
<p>
<br>
<b>HIGHWAY SAFETY PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is responsible for regulatory and other programs involving highway and vehicle safety. In addition, the Office of Motor Carriers deals with safety issues associated with interstate bus and truck transportation, and the Office of Research and Special Programs includes or oversees several other related efforts including Hazardous Materials Safety, Pipeline Safety, the Transportation Safety Institute, and university research programs. 
<p>
All of these programs should be reviewed for effectiveness or redundancy and to determine whether they are more properly the province of the states. Once reviewed and restructured, the remaining federal safety responsibilities should be transferred to a newly created independent federal entity — an Interstate Transportation Safety Office (or Administration) -- which includes all the other transportation safety responsibilities now within DOT, such as those of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Maritime Administration. 
<p>
As part of this review, Congress should consider creating national maximum vehicle safety standards to discourage states from imposing more restrictive regulations that impede interstate commerce and add unnecessarily to costs. A possible precedent for such federal maximum standards is the standards promulgated and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the manufactured housing industry. Again, however, highway safety programs are more legitimately the province of the states.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (23 USC 401).
<p>
<li>Merge vehicle-related interstate safety programs into the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office.
<p>
<li>Devolve the remaining non-interstate highway safety programs to the states.
<p>
<li>Merge any critical statistical functions into the Census Bureau or its successor agency.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION</b>
<p>
Created by the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 and administered by DOT's Federal Transit Administration, the federal transit program is a costly failure:  Mass transit's market position today is the same as 31 years ago when Congress passed the Act. The program has consistently led to unwise transportation decisions by state and local authorities, encouraged local transit monopolies, and precluded the adoption of cost-effective operating methods and innovative solutions.
<p>
Although funding from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund and other federal revenues provide only a small fraction of the financial resources available to urban mass transit systems, the many regulations and mandates attached to federal funding have had a profoundly adverse influence on local transit policy. Despite the billions of dollars of state, local, and federal money invested in costly transit systems over the past 30 years, annual transit trips per capita have declined by one-third, and barely two percent of person trips today are by transit. In addition, transit's work trip (commuter) market share declined from 1980 to 1990 in 36 of the nation's 39 metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million.<b>20</b>
<p>
<b>Monopolistic Control.</b> Transit's vastly diminished status reflects more than a century of government meddling and government-sanctioned and protected monopolies, whether public or private. Private transit companies and systems emerged in the late 19th century and grew rapidly in response to the growth of the urban population during the industrial revolution. Although private in origin, these rail-based companies quickly became monopolies by obtaining exclusive franchises from local and state governments. As early as the second decade of this century, governments in city after city outlawed jitneys (independently owned and operated buses), eliminating any competitive threat that might confront the private transit monopolists.
<p>
Unfortunately for these transit companies, their government protection from competition was not without its cost. Over the ensuing decades, these private systems were subject to price controls on their fares, mandatory service on designated routes, and mandated frequency of service. At the same time, they became easy prey for organized labor, which could shut down an entire city because all competing systems and companies had been eliminated. Private transit systems had little choice but to accede to exorbitant union wage demands and work rule requirements. These work rules are still in force, but in the public transit sector where federal mandates help maintain organized labor's privileged position in local systems.<b>21</b>
<p>
Local governments could suppress organized business competition to their protected transit franchisees, but they could not suppress the striving of individual commuters for something better. These individuals began to exercise their free will and seek a more convenient and cost-effective solution by driving their cars to work and to market. Subject to heavy government regulation and high labor costs, and thus unable to compete, the private transit monopolists began to face serious financial problems as their customers went elsewhere. With harsh labor contracts precluding cost savings through labor efficiencies, transit companies turned to deferred maintenance, capital acquisition, and reductions in other services. The ensuing deterioration in service further discouraged customers, and revenues continued to decline until the systems went bankrupt. One by one, they were taken over by local governments or multi-jurisdictional transit authorities. Taxpayer-supported public monopolies replaced the private ones that had failed.
<p>
<b>The Federal Takeover.</b> The next step was to get the federal government involved. This occurred in 1964 with the enactment of the Urban Mass Transit Act, which provided for capital grants to fund up to 75 percent of local projects. Section 13(c) of the Act also effectively codified organized labor's privileged position within the transit system by requiring, as a condition of federal aid, that a transit authority sign a U.S. Department of Labor-approved contract with transit unions. Among other things, these mandated agreements generally include provisions requiring a six-year severance payment for transit employees dismissed because of efficiency measures.
<p>
This Act was just one of several pieces of federal legislation during the 1960s that shifted heretofore local responsibilities such as housing, transit, and welfare to the federal government, all with disastrous results. Ten years later, in 1974, the Urban Mass Transit Act was amended to extend federal support to operating subsidies as part of a national energy conservation effort. Today, the federal government spends about $4 billion each year to help subsidize a service that millions of consumers overwhelmingly reject in growing numbers:  Just over five percent of employees now get to work using public transit.
<p>
<b>Impact of Cutting Off Federal Subsidies.</b> Because federal support accounts for only about five percent of transit operating costs, and because existing transit system borrowing capabilities would be sufficient to add more and replace existing capital assets, the termination of all federal subsidies would have little initial negative impact on transit's ability to serve its dwindling customer base. Indeed, encouraging greater self-reliance and removing all of the costly and counterproductive mandates attached to federal grants and subsidies would leave enterprising transit authorities financially better off, because the estimated cost of these mandates is more than two to three times the value of the subsidy.<b>22</b> For FY 1996, the House/Senate conference report on the budget proposes a substantial reduction in federal financial support of transit but stops short of recommending the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration, as proposed originally by the House.
<p>
With the provisions of Section 13(c) eliminated and no longer able to disrupt productive labor-management relations, transit authorities could adopt widely available cost savings opportunities through such practices as competitive contracting and better management of existing workforce. Because of the lack of incentives for properly managing existing personnel, and because of the many restrictive work rules common to its federally approved labor contracts, America's public transit industry has been the only major industry to experience a decline in labor productivity during the 1980s. Over that period, transit's productivity fell a staggering 40 percent compared with an increase in all other transportation sectors, including even Amtrak.<b>23</b>
<p>
The combination of rising wages and falling productivity has had a profoundly adverse effect on transit's cost structure. Unit costs (costs per mile or hour) are often double, or more expensive than market costs for the same services, even when provided by private contractors using union labor. As a result, U.S. transit cost escalation has been greater than that of health care and greater than that of transit systems in other developed nations.<b>24</b>
<p>
As long as the federal government is there to bail them out, transit authorities have no incentive to become more efficient or to adopt management techniques common to other businesses, and local communities and governments, which oversee these transit systems, have no incentive to interfere or to exercise their responsibility on behalf of their constituents and transit's customers. Without the federal cushion and indirect oversight, local governments could restructure their transit systems in ways that serve the customer, not managers and employees and Washington bureaucrats that devise and enforce the regulations and mandates.
<p>
With the federal government no longer providing capital grants that mandate certain types of equipment, transit authorities also would be free to acquire less expensive but more suitable equipment. Moreover, with transit authorities now fully responsible for servicing the debt incurred to acquire the equipment, these capital assets would be better maintained than has been the practice.<b>25</b>
<p>
<b>The Need for Competition.</b> Chief among the necessary reforms is opening the local transit market to competition by eliminating the legal monopoly now held by all transit authorities. Today, anyone offering services in competition with existing public transit is in violation of various criminal and civil statutes. As the limited contracting out done by transit services demonstrates, private-sector providers, often using unionized workers, are able to provide the same service for less money, make a profit, pay taxes, and service the debt on their equipment -- four simple tasks that no public transit service in the country could hope to accomplish. 
<p>
While the potential cost savings are considerable, the real benefit to consumers from competition is the creativity that it will unleash in devising innovative solutions to traditional problems. In the hands of government monopolies, U.S. transit systems now rely on a combination of solutions and services that have not evolved much beyond those that were developed between 1880 and 1920, except that they cost much more and offer less convenient service. Not surprisingly, modern Americans have little interest in a type of service that was becoming obsolete when their grandparents were coming of age.
<p>
Typical of Congress's fascination with 19th century technologies are the costly light rail systems it has funded in communities across the United States, notwithstanding a pervasive lack of commuter interest. The "new start" rail capital program has financed some of the most costly and ineffective pork-barrel projects in the nation, despite the absence of any evidence from anywhere in the world that urban rail lines reduce traffic congestion. These systems involve sometimes staggering costs. According to one recent report, the congressionally approved Tasman Corridor, a $500 million, 12.4-mile light rail line in California linking Milpitas and Mountain View, will cost $33 for each new rider.<b>26</b>
<p>
A DOT study by Harvard economists indicates that bus-ways can be built and operated for one-fifth the cost of new rail systems.<b>27</b> But rail systems have become a federally financed way to enhance civic pride and accommodate the preferences of hobbyists and rail buffs. Virtually all academic researchers not dependent upon income from the transit industry or the Federal Transit Administration agree that building publicly financed rail transit is indefensible. 
<p>
Even if the cost could be justified, no element of today's local transit programs calls for federal involvement. Transit programs are, by definition, local in scope, and where two or three states are involved in the same system, interstate compacts can be formed to provide region-wide management and help raise the funds needed to maintain the service. Removing the federal government from local transit matters would leave state and local governments free to devise their own solutions, reduce costs by getting rid of federal red tape, and adopt creative solutions from a competitive private sector that stands to profit by serving its customers. 
<p>
Supporters of the status quo argue that there is no money to be made in transit and that the financial failures of government-regulated monopolies in the 1950s and 1960s prove this. What they really prove, of course, is the counterproductive effects of government-sanctioned anti-competitive practices and regulation. Today, scores of profit-making, private transit firms bid eagerly on every government contract offered, and at prices below the level charged by public transit. The only thing that prevents a flood of private buses, vans, and taxis from offering low-cost, for-profit transit services in cities and suburbs is the threat of legal action from government.  
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Transit Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the federal transit program (49 USC Chapter 21).<br> 
States should be free to provide financial support to their transit systems through the transportation block grant proposed in the previous section or through other means.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) oversees rail safety, rail subsidies, and rail research. It also administers the Northeast Corridor rail rehabilitation project and owns and administers the Transportation Test Center, staffed by the Association of American Railroads. Only one of these functions -- interstate rail safety -- is an appropriate federal activity. Research should be funded by the railroad industry. 
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Abolish the Federal Railroad Administration (49 USC APP. 1652).
<p>
<li>Repeal all FRA functions not involving interstate rail safety.
<p>
<li>Sell the Transportation Test Center to the private sector. 
<p>
<li>Merge rail safety programs into the proposed Office of Interstate Transportation Safety. 
<p>
<br>
<b>THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (Amtrak)</b><br>
The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) was created in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail service. Conceived as a two-year federally assisted experiment, Amtrak has managed to survive for 25 years at a cumulative cost to the taxpayer of over $17 billion plus interest. With a fleet of approximately 2,200 cars and engines operating on over 25,000 miles of track, Amtrak carries approximately 22 million passengers a year. 
<p>
President Clinton's budget proposed a subsidy of $750 million for FY 1996 and assumed that Amtrak will adopt substantial reforms to make itself more commercially viable and reduce its reliance on federal operating subsidies. Although the original House Republican proposal was even more generous, the House/Senate budget conference cut more than $200 million from Amtrak. However, efforts to reform operations, particularly onerous labor requirements, failed as many House Republicans voted with the Democrats to preserve the extraordinary privileges in organized labor's Amtrak contract. This failed reform effort illustrates why it is time to terminate the federal subsidy at the end of this fiscal year, giving Amtrak time to develop a strategic plan to achieve financial independence from the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>Amtrak's Marginal Impact on America's Transport Needs.</b> Carrying less than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers, Amtrak has become a costly burden on the taxpayer. Proposed for termination in several budgets during the Reagan Administration, it has been kept alive by Congress, which has provided billions in annual subsidies in return for promises that the corporation would become commercially viable. It never has, and those who believe it will in the future are allowing hope to triumph over experience and good sense. Despite 25 years of reform efforts and promises, the best the government has been able to do is to reduce the annual subsidy from over a billion dollars during the Carter Administration to about half that during the Reagan Presidency. Under Clinton the subsidy has been creeping back up to Jimmy Carter levels of generosity. 
<p>
After years of mismanagement, overly generous labor agreements, and intense competition from airlines and long-haul buses, Amtrak's financial situation has deteriorated, and its prospects for improvement are even more illusory than in the past. In December 1994, as a result of competitive pressures on revenues, higher than expected operating costs, and a serious accident, Amtrak's budget went even deeper into the red, forcing the company to announce a series of major route and service cuts to stay within its existing budget and federal subsidy. Faced with persistent competition from private buses and airlines, Amtrak will continue to struggle with a worsening deficit, in addition to which deferred maintenance, an aging fleet (23 years per car today, compared with 17.5 years in 1989), and rapid depreciation of the Northeast Corridor's roadbed will likely cause operating and essential capital costs to escalate rapidly, requiring even larger taxpayer subsidies.
<p>
Amtrak represents a failed attempt to convert inter-city rail service from a subsidized system to a self-sustaining, profitable system. Amtrak achieves a significant market share only in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston) -- and only with heavy subsidies per rider. In virtually all other markets, eliminating service would have no discernible impact on transportation facilities (highways and airports), because Amtrak's market share is infinitesimal.
<p>
To compensate for the loss of federal financial support, Amtrak's strategic survival plan should include privatization of commercially viable routes; partnerships with other transportation, travel, and recreational entities; or regional public-private partnerships through more aggressive use of the 403(b) provisions of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which allow for greater cost sharing with states and local communities served by Amtrak. In the event that the mid-Atlantic and northeast states served by Amtrak's Northeast Corridor operation find the service of value to their citizens and businesses, they could use some portion of their proposed transportation block grant or state-controlled fuel tax to keep regional Amtrak service in operation. To facilitate this, the DOT should be prepared to conduct an orderly transfer of necessary assets and responsibilities -- chiefly the rolling stock and roadbed -- to the affected states.
<p>
Existing law and practice allow for this, and there is precedent for state takeover of routes abandoned for budgetary purposes. Under the Section 403(b) provisions of the Act, and in response to Amtrak's elimination of several costly and wasteful lines, California will take over daily Amtrak service between San Francisco and Sacramento.
<p>
There is no public purpose to be served by further taxpayer support of Amtrak. Nor is there any practical reason to phase out federal support only gradually, as many in Congress suggest. A careful reading of 25 years of presidential budget proposals and congressional appropriations bills for transportation, shows annual promises by Amtrak to get its house in order. But Amtrak has never delivered on its promises, and never will. This Congress should distinguish itself from its predecessors by being the first not to be fooled by Amtrak's bureaucracy or its powerful unions.
<p>
<br>
<b>The High Speed Rail Program</b><br> 
In addition to subsidizing Amtrak, the DOT subsidizes a costly high speed rail program designed to encourage the development of high speed rail corridors. This program serves no useful purpose because the inter-city transportation market already is served by self-sustaining (profitable) air and surface operators. High speed rail is not commercial in the United States for a variety of reasons, among them the country's relatively low population densities, relatively high access to automobiles, and competitive (deregulated) air transportation market, which is capable of price discounting that renders high speed rail uncompetitive. As a result, a number of privately financed high speed rail proposals have failed, and the federal government is not likely to improve on this record.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Eliminate all Amtrak funding (including operating and capital support, the Northeast Corridor improvement program, and Penn Station). Management should be encouraged to develop creative solutions for survival.
<p>
<li>Repeal the National Railroad Passenger Act and the Rail Passenger Service Act. This, among other things, would terminate Amtrak's statutory monopoly (45 USC 541).
<p>
<li>Pre-authorize, in legislation, an interstate compact among northeastern states and the District of Columbia for the purpose of facilitating Northeast Corridor rail transportation in the event that citizens of these states are willing to subsidize the service.
<p>
<li>Repeal Amtrak's labor protections. Workers today can receive up to six years severance pay and enjoy numerous other protections and privileges because of costly work rules.
<p>
<li>Repeal the high speed rail program (49 USC Chapter 22).
<p>

<b>THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</b><br>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with an annual budget of $8.4 billion and 49,000 employees, manages the nation's civilian air traffic control system, promotes air transport safety, and assists in the financing of airport improvements. Approximately three-quarters of its personnel are involved directly with the air traffic control system,<b>28</b> composed largely of the operations of airport control towers, which guide aircraft through landings and takeoffs, and twenty en route centers, which manage the flow of air traffic between airports in the system. The FAA has broad responsibility for regulating air transportation and managing the nation's airways, in addition to such safety-related duties as aircraft certification, airport security, maintenance inspection, and pilot licensing.
<p>
The FAA's programs are funded through a combination of general revenues and the Aviation Trust Fund, itself financed by a series of user fees and dedicated taxes related to system usage. In 1995 these user fees and special taxes totaled over $6 billion. They were derived chiefly from the passenger ticket tax ($4,829 million), the waybill tax ($325 million), the fuel tax ($195 million), and interest on the trust fund ($809 million). At the beginning of 1995, the trust fund account had accumulated to $12.3 billion.<b>29</b>
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Air Traffic Control Responsibilities</b><br>
Although the FAA's air traffic control (ATC) system has helped provide the American traveler with one of the safest forms of transportation, shifting the system to the private sector would give it the flexibility and resources needed to speed modernization, enhance operating efficiency, and better manage and retain its many employees. The ATC system's efforts to improve and modernize operations have suffered from the bureaucratic idiosyncrasies of the federal procurement process, the civil service code, and congressional and executive branch meddling. One former FAA Commissioner noted that congressional committees had mandated the installation of thirty pieces of equipment neither authorized by Congress nor requested by the FAA. At the same time, rigid government pay scales have limited the FAA's ability to attract experienced professionals to high-cost, high-stress urban air traffic control facilities.<b>30</b>
<p>
<b>Faster Modernization.</b> The ATC's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar modernization program is a costly failure. As a result, the system remains one of the world's largest users of vacuum tubes, some of which are available only through formerly East Bloc countries.<b>31</b> Freed from oppressive government procurement procedures, a privatized corporation could speed the modernization of the air traffic control system by drawing on private capital. This would reduce costs by raising worker productivity; improving passenger safety through better and more accurate controls; diminishing weather-related cancellations, delays, and safety risks; and allowing more intensive use of existing airports, thereby cutting future infrastructure costs.
<p>
At the same time, automation of the many ATC functions that would be triggered by privatization would quickly turn an existing liability into an asset. Dependent upon the obsolete, high-maintenance, and labor-intensive technologies of the past, today's air traffic control system confronts a serious shortage of skilled personnel as an aging workforce becomes eligible for retirement. With the adoption of advanced technologies that allow a few to do the work of many, and that also require less maintenance, the prospect of significant retirements over the near term would allow for the orderly and costless downsizing of FAA's substantial workforce. 
<p>
<b>Budgetary Savings.</b> Although the ATC system relies heavily on user fees, general revenues still supplement its budget. An internal DOT study in 1994 concluded that converting the FAA's ATC component into a self-sufficient, independent government corporation could lead to savings of $18 billion, or approximately $2 billion per year, from 1996 to 2005.<b>32</b> As a quasi-government entity, this corporatized system would continue to rely on the passenger ticket tax as the chief source of ATC funding, but the general revenues that now fund a portion of FAA/ATC operations would be cut off. To compensate for this loss, the system would be permitted to borrow in capital markets on its own account to fund long-term investments and modernization. The FAA's safety and regulatory functions would remain within the federal government as part of a much smaller FAA, whose role would be largely one of system oversight, a legitimate federal function that would improve in quality as the government concentrated its energies and resources on a limited number of activities. 
<p>
While the Clinton Administration's plan for the ATC system is bold and innovative by past federal reform standards, opportunities for even greater reform exist in today's political climate. These should be pursued, as they are now in other industrialized countries. At present, the air traffic control systems in Canada, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are corporatizing, privatizing, or actively considering one of these options. 
<p>
To privatize the ATC system, Congress should use as its model the proposal developed by Robert Poole of the Reason Foundation in a series of reports and publications dating back to 1982.<b>33</b>
<p>
<b>Privatizing the ATC System</b><br> 
The first step would be to reorganize the FAA by creating, as an independent government corporation, a U.S. Airways Corporation (USAC) and transfering to it all current ATC-related FAA staff (about 40,000), all FAA facilities and equipment used to operate the ATC system, and all ATC responsibilities now held by the FAA. During the reorganization period, and until the new corporation was established and operating successfully, all of its shares would be held by the U.S. Treasury on behalf of the federal government. Also as part of the reorganization, consideration should be given to creating several new air traffic control companies to ensure post-government competition. Half the towers could go into one, and half to another (the same would be true for the en route centers). Once privatized, they would be free to compete for business.
<p>
After the transition, the shares would be sold to the public, with special allowances for concessionary purchases by existing employees and managers. Within the portion of shares available to the public, a sub-portion could be set aside for purchase by firms and industries heavily dependent upon the USAC's services, such as the major airlines or associations representing general aviation, international aviation, passengers, overnight package delivery, and general cargo. 
<p>
Once established, the USAC would operate on a self-supporting basis and would be authorized to borrow for major capital expenditures, modernization, and other improvements. In contrast to the Clinton Administration's proposal to continue funding a restructured ATC through the existing passenger ticket tax, the private USAC would be funded by a direct user fee levied on the aircraft according to their utilization of the services provided by the system. As Poole has observed, the "daunting challenge facing ATC spin-off proposals is developing a user fee structure that is politically feasible yet fully funds the corporation"<b>34</b> and which also avoids the cross-subsidies inherent in the current system.
<p>
These cross-subsidies are considerable. For example, whereas passenger ticket taxes collected through the airlines account for 88 percent of the current system's revenues, airlines utilize 49 percent of its en route services and just 20 percent of the tower services. In contrast, general aviation provides just three percent of the revenues but accounts for 21 percent of en route costs and 60 percent of tower costs.<b>35</b> At the same time, government flights, chiefly military, utilize some ATC system services, but pay no direct, indirect, or other fees, although the military air traffic controllers provide some services to civilian aircraft, also at no charge.
<p>
In developing a new fee/price structure for the USAC, Poole recommends three general guiding principles:
<p>
<li>No one should pay for services they do not use;
<p>
<li>Non-commercial ("true" general aviation) customers should pay only the marginal costs they impose on the system; and
<p>
<li>Charges should be based upon long-run economic costs. 
<p>
A fourth principle should be added to Poole's list, based on prevailing views within Congress:
<p>
<li>Military (government) flights should not incur direct charges for utilization of USAC services, but the USAC -- through an annual appropriation from general government revenues  -- should be compensated for costs incurred.
<p>
<b>Fees That Are Fair.</b> Poole proposes a fee structure based on the technique of marginal cost pricing that utilizes the earlier pioneering analysis of Richard Golaszewski.<b>36</b> Golaszewski established marginal cost estimates for each of the four major user groups (airlines, commuters, general aviation, and military) for each of the key air traffic control services (air traffic control centers, flight service stations, terminal radar control facilities, and air traffic control twoers) and then allocated to each group their estimated share of fixed costs and other overhead.<b>37</b> Poole modifies these cost estimates by inflating the original 1985 estimates to 1991 levels and by reducing non-commercial general aviation's share of the costs to direct marginal costs actually incurred. Congress should further modify the Golaszewski/Poole proposal by deleting fees charged to the military and instead covering such costs incurred by the USAC on behalf of the military (which would have amounted to $8.3 million in 1990) out of general government revenues. 
<p>
With this modification, a new fee structure that meets the four principles above and covers all costs of operating the USAC would be approximately like that indicated in the table on the previous page. This table provides the specific fee per aircraft for each service incurred for each of the four main categories of civilian aviation.
<p>
<b>Savings for Passengers and Airlines.</b> The benefits of a privatized ATC system, stimulated by the profit incentive and free to pursue modern and innovative solutions to air traffic control problems, would be substantial. One airline estimates that a satellite-based air traffic control system modeled after the military's Global Positioning System would allow for precision approaches to airports and could save the airline industry $525 million per year through delay reduction, direct flight routing, and other improvements. Other analyses put the range of savings from ATC improvements in the range of $300 million to $1.5 billion per year.<b>38</b> As noted earlier, even greater savings would accrue to the taxpayer. Both DOT and the Senate Budget Committee project annual federal budget reductions of as much as $2 billion per year from corporatizing or privatizing FAA's ATC functions, largely by shifting the funding of its capital requirements from the taxpayer to the credit markets where it more logically belongs.
<p>
Management efficiencies and service improvements would follow from the USAC's ability to escape current civil service restrictions that make it difficult to fill key positions in high-cost areas because of pay caps and national pay scales. Under the current system, key towers and control facilities in such critical places as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles frequently are understaffed because of an uncompetitive pay scale. Similarly, the end of civil service constraints would allow the hiring of more professional managers with the business skills and experience to implement a comprehensive overhaul of the system.
<p>
Most important, freedom from congressional meddling and second-guessing and an end to federal procurement requirements and red tape would allow for swift implementation of a badly needed, but oft-delayed and error-plagued, technological upgrade of the system.
<p>
<b>Taking Care of the Work Force.</b> Obviously, a restructuring involving nearly 50,000 employees entails substantial and complicated transition issues, including labor contracts and explicit and implicit employment commitments. To ease the transition and reduce employees' uncertainty regarding their treatment, a formal commitment could be made to entitle the transferred workforce to civil service retirement system benefits already earned. This commitment could be financed out of general government revenues in the same way that earned worker health and retirement benefits were maintained when the post office became an independent government corporation in 1970. Alternatively, interest earnings on -- and, if necessary, the surplus in -- the Aviation Trust Fund could be used to cover the unfunded liabilities in the civil service retirement obligations for employees transferred to the USAC. For all workers hired after the formation of the USAC, a new pension system would be established that is fully funded and consistent with private-sector norms.
<p>
<br>
<b>The FAA's Flight Safety Responsibilities</b><br>
All existing FAA air transport safety, licensing, and certification functions would be transferred to a new independent transportation safety agency, the Interstate Transportation Safety Office or Administration (ITSO), as discussed earlier. This new entity could be funded from general revenues or from a portion of existing waybill and fuel taxes. At present, the FAA has primary safety rule-making authority, which includes certificating aircraft and developing and enforcing operating rules and procedures. Other safety functions include pilot and mechanic licensing, accident investigation, airport safety, safety analysis, and information.
<p>
ITSO would be responsible for continuing the safety-related duties now performed by the FAA and by the other transportation safety-related divisions within DOT and elsewhere. Under the current organizational arrangement, portions of these functions are located in the FAA's Regulation and Organizational Analysis Division, Regulations and Standards Training Division, Airport Safety and Operations Division, Office of Aviation Systems Standards, Civilian Aviation Security, and the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification. All of these functions and staff would be transferred to the Aviation Safety Division of the new ITSO. Funding for the aviation division of ITSO could come from the existing freight waybill tax, fuel tax, international departure tax, and interest earnings on the trust fund. DOT's 1994 "Air Traffic Control:  Analysis of Illustrative Corporate Financial Scenarios" estimates that the FAA's safety duties cost $700 million in FY 1993.
<p>
<b>Better Safety.</b> Although the FAA has an excellent reputation for overseeing one of the safest air transport systems in the world, there is always room for improvement. The proposed restructuring could help facilitate this for several reasons. First, undistracted by its commercial-type ATC functions, an independent flight safety component could devote all of its attention and energy to promoting safety. Second, and related to this, those responsible for maintaining safety no longer would have to make the compromises necessary in an entity with multiple, and at times conflicting, objectives. As the operator of the ATC system, FAA essentially regulates itself and is required to make tradeoffs in trying to promote both safety and the health of the U.S. aviation industry.
<p>
<b>Airports and the Airport Improvement Program</b><br>
Funded from the Aviation Trust Fund through a portion of the passenger ticket tax and other dedicated taxes, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants to eligible airports for certain infrastructure projects. The federal government owns no civilian airports, except for Dulles and National, both of which serve Washington, D.C., and are now operated under long-term lease to a regional authority. Of the nation's 17,000 civilian airports, 13,000 are privately owned (mostly small and serving non-commercial general aviation primarily). The other 4,000 are owned by local governments or regional public airport authorities. Within these 4,000 are all of the airports served by the commercial airline industry as well as all of the hubs, both minor and major. 
<p>
In any given year, the AIP provides just a fraction of the funding for eligible airport improvement projects, with the largest and busiest airports receiving the smallest cash return relative to passenger ticket taxes paid. A 1990 analysis found that major airports at Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, and San Francisco received in annual entitlement grants less than 12 percent of the amount they contributed to the Aviation Trust Fund in ticket taxes. Meanwhile other airports (including, for example, such smaller airports as Charlotte, Dallas, Love Field, and Memphis) each received more than 30 percent of their contribution.<b>39</b> (Because the passenger ticket tax also partly funds the FAA's air traffic control and safety responsibilities, AIP grant returns will always be well below 100 percent of ticket tax revenues.)
<p>
<b>Costly Mandates.</b> As with urban mass transit and the Highway Trust Fund, the regulations and mandates attached to federal airport grant money may be more costly than the value of the grant because they constrain an airport's ability to tailor its services to the specific needs of its community and diminish its incentive and ability to become financially more self-sufficient. In return for accepting these funds, airports must agree to a number of federal regulations, including how and how much they charge for landing fees, caps on passenger fees, and limits on the utilization of surplus revenues earned on airport operations, as well as numerous other revenue and spending restrictions.
<p>
For example, federal law requires that airports charge landing fees based on weight of the aircraft, even though small planes take as much time and runway space to land as large planes. This leads to overuse of scarce airport resources by planes carrying only a few passengers. Peak load pricing for landing fees is also prohibited, thereby removing any direct financial incentive for passengers, aircraft, and airlines to schedule flights at less congested times, and for passengers to be charged accordingly. Likewise, the Federal Anti-Head Tax Act prohibits airports from charging passengers a use fee of more than $1, $2, or $3 per passenger and limits how these revenues may be used. In a number of cases, the FAA has forbidden airports from applying such funds to improvements in surface transit access that could alleviate vehicular congestion and delays. And sections of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 prohibit federally funded airports from using any profits generated at the airport for non-airport purposes, thereby discouraging cities and communities from fully developing the economic potential of their airports.<b>40</b>
<p>
Because of the many onerous strings attached to federal grants, many airport managers have concluded that they would be better off without this assistance. A 1987 DOT poll of operators of hub airports found that the majority of large, medium, and small hub operators would be willing to give up federal financial assistance, including airport improvement grants, in return for the elimination of the numerous federal restrictions on their operations and the freedom to set their own fees on airport users.<b>41</b>
<p>
The airport grant program should be terminated along with the FAA's passenger ticket tax, a portion of which funds AIP grants from the trust fund. At the same time, all the needless federal restrictions and prohibitions on airport fees, revenues, and profits should be struck from the law. Airports should be free to fund their operations and their expansion and improvement programs with financial resources derived from their own choice of fees, rents, taxes, or other measures. With no limits on profits or what can be done with them, airports would have an incentive to develop their facilities more intensively with rent-paying hotels, restaurants, parking facilities, retail stores, offices, and other businesses that would pay a premium to be either at or near an airport. 
<p>
Airports also could alter their landing fee structure by raising fees at peak times -- early morning and late afternoon -- and lowering them at off-peak times to encourage airlines to shift flights to less congested periods. Similarly, they could reimpose some form of a ticket tax, or head tax, but at well below current rates. Whatever the choice, the source and amount of the replacement revenues would conform more closely to the specific needs of a particular airport, as well as the passengers and airlines it serves. At the same time, improvement projects at any airport would occur when it chose, not when officials in Washington finally approve and schedule the project. 
<p>
To accomplish this, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and the Airport and Airway Improvement Act must be amended substantially, and the remaining portions of these laws limited largely to legitimate safety issues and <i>bona fide</i> issues of interstate commerce. These legislative changes would better facilitate airport privatization at the discretion of existing airport owners (primarily state and local governments), or regional authorities established on their behalf. Currently, such privatizations are authorized, albeit on a restrictive basis, by Executive Order 12803, issued by President George Bush on April 30, 1992, and implicitly endorsed by the Clinton Administration, which issued Executive Order 12983 on January 6, 1994, to clarify federal law facilitating such privatizations. These orders, and FAA's narrow and limiting interpretation of them, should be reviewed and changed as necessary to reflect the broader privatization options that would be available under the above proposals.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Transform the Air Traffic Control system into an independent corporation. This could be either government or private, funded entirely by direct user fees.
<p>
<li>Transfer FAA safety responsibilities to a new federal safety department.
<p>
<li>"Defederalize" airports by freeing them from non-safety-related regulations as well as financial support from the Airport Improvement Program.
<p>
<br>
<b>THE COAST GUARD</b><br>
With an annual budget of approximately $3.7 billion, the Coast Guard (CG) performs a variety of services, including coastal law enforcement and national defense, marine safety, environmental protection, search and rescue, and navigation and waterway management (traffic management, ice breaking, and maintenance of navigational aids).
<p>
Given the large changes in its objectives over the past several decades in response to the rapid increase in drug smuggling, the Coast Guard and its law enforcement and defense functions should be transferred to the Department of Justice to permit better coordination with other federal law enforcement agencies and activities. Related Coast Guard functions also should be transferred to Justice. These include the Office of Command, Control and Communications; Office of Engineering, Logistics and Development (ELD); Office of Personnel and Training; Office of Readiness and Reserve; and Military Personnel Command. ELD would be given more of an oversight function, with much of the work now done in house performed by the private sector on a contract basis.
<p>
With its focus now primarily on law enforcement, the Coast Guard's search and rescue duties should be limited to extreme emergencies and severe weather. Routine rescues and assistance to recreational and commercial boaters would become the responsibility of the more than 200 existing private rescue services that handled more than 40,000 cases last year. Among other savings, this should allow for a significant reduction in the number of Coast Guard air and sea facilities, including the 185 small boat units now maintained by the Coast Guard, as recommended by the General Accounting Office.<b>42</b>
<p>
The Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection should be split among existing government departments. Environmental responsibilities should be shifted to the EPA, and oversight for marine safety matters should be transferred to the proposed Interstate Transportation Safety Office. The Coast Guard already is using the private sector for some licensing and inspection, and this should be accelerated. Merchant vessel regulatory issues other than safety or environment should remain within the divisions transferred to Justice.
<p>
Waterway navigation, maintenance, and safety responsibilities of the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services that are purely local or regional in scope -- rivers, bays, ports, and harbors -- should become the responsibility of contiguous states. Those of an unambiguous national nature would remain with the Coast Guard as reconstituted within the Department of Justice. Many of these functions could be privatized easily. GAO, for example, has recommended the VTS 2000 system now under development as a candidate for privatization. The Port of Los Angeles VTS system already has been privatized.
<p>
<br>
<b>The Maritime Administration (MARAD)</b><br>
The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to ensure that the United States maintained a domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency. Organized as an agency within the Department of Transportation, it spends nearly $700 million a year implementing a series of Depression-era maritime laws that shield U.S.-flagged vessels from foreign competition. 
<p>
MARAD's Operating Differential direct subsidy program pays U.S.-flag vessel operators the difference between the costs of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flagged vessel and the costs of shipping on a foreign-flagged vessel. The Ocean Freight Differential program (authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985) subsidizes a portion of the cargo preference costs on agricultural food aid shipments for commodities exported with grants or loans from the Department of Agriculture. Cargo preference laws require that 75 percent of such exports be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The Jones Act, authorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires that cargo transported between two U.S. cities be carried on U.S.-built and U.S.-flagged vessels. MARAD also maintains the merchant ships retained in the Defense Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
The Maritime Administration should be closed down, and the Operating Differential Subsidies, Cargo Preference rules, and Jones Act should be repealed. The government-owned merchant ships in the Ready Reserve Fleet should be sold and the Federal Ship Financing and Maritime Guaranteed Loan programs ended.
<p>
For over sixty years, the federal government has spent billions on a variety of programs intended to support the U.S. maritime industry. Instead, these programs have undermined the competitiveness of U.S. shipping and shipbuilding. Today, only about four percent of waterborne cargoes imported and exported from the United States are carried on U.S.-flag carriers. According to the GAO, between 1982 and 1992 the number of U.S. privately owned ships decreased by 31.4 percent, from 574 to 394.<b>43</b>
<p>
The Maritime Administration pays over $200 million in direct Operating Differential subsidies to 48 oceangoing container ships and 27 bulk cargo vessels. Most of these subsidy contracts are due to expire by the end of 1997. The Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget requested a reduction to $154 million. However, the Administration also would create a new Maritime Security Program which would give $100 million per year in direct payments to up to fifty U.S. flagged vessels for a period of ten years. This proposal should be rejected.
<p>
In 1994, the GAO reported that "the application of cargo preference to food aid programs does not significantly contribute to meeting the intended objectives of helping to maintain U.S.-flag ships as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency or for purposes of domestic or foreign commerce."  The GAO found that by sheltering U.S. shippers from competition, "cargo preference laws make it possible for U.S. ship owners to maintain inefficient and commercially uncompetitive U.S.-flag ships that do not significantly contribute to the ability of the U.S. merchant marine to carry foreign commerce other than food aid."<b>44</b>
<p>
MARAD's Ocean Freight Differential program spends over $60 million a year reimbursing the higher costs paid by the Department of Agriculture to export domestic agricultural products. These cargo preference requirements, as they are known, also increase by some $520 million annually the shipping costs for the Departments of Transportation and Defense, the Agency for International Development, and the Export-Import Bank. The Maritime Administration does not reimburse these agencies for these added costs. Meanwhile, Jones Act restrictions on inter-city cargo transport cost consumers billions of dollars but do not show up on the federal budget. According to a September 1994 study by the International Trade Commission, the Jones Act increases costs to American consumers by at least $3 billion annually, and perhaps by as much as $10 billion.
<p>
The Maritime Administration spent $330 million in fiscal 1994 and $205 million in fiscal 1995 maintaining the fleet of government-owned merchant ships known as the Ready Reserve Force. By all accounts, these vessels are in such a state of disrepair that only a few could be made seaworthy in time to carry cargo for the Persian Gulf War. These ships should be sold for whatever the government can get for them.
<p>
<br>
<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
<li>Shut down the Maritime Administration.
<p>
<li>Repeal the Operating Differential Subsidies, the Cargo Preference Rules, and the Jones Act.
<p>
<li>Privatize the Ready Reserve Fleet.
<p>
<li>Terminate the Federal Ship Financing Program and the guaranteed loan program.

Lecture 536: Downsizing Government, by Senator Abraham
 -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 536</b>
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Downsizing Government:  Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3>
Senator Abraham addressed a meeting of The <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage">Heritage Foundation</a>'s Washington Policy Roundtable on July  26,  1995.
<p>
<br>
As the Co-Chair of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and the <a href="gopher://gopher.senate.gov/">Senate</a> sponsor of the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, I am extremely pleased to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our efforts to eliminate the <a href="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</a>. I also want to take this opportunity to thank The Heritage Foundation for putting forward detailed proposals for eliminating several Cabinet departments; many of your suggestions have found their way into the four Cabinet elimination bills that the task force has developed.
<p>
In my mind, no issue better symbolizes the dramatic changes that have occurred since the November elections than the ongoing efforts to eliminate departments of the federal government.  Just a year ago, members walking the halls of Congress were discussing the merits of making the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> a Cabinet-level department.  Today, Morton Kondracke is predicting on "The McLaughlin Group" that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the Department of Commerce will not be eliminated this year.  I don't agree with his prediction, but I like his choice of topics.
<p>
Our task force was set up to examine ways to dismantle four Cabinet departments:  Commerce, <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a>. These four departments alone employ more than 74,000 bureaucrats and have combined budgets of $70 billion -- 133 times more than the entire federal government spent at the turn of the century. We must target these departments if we are truly to restrain the growth of government, reduce the tax burden on American businesses and workers, and balance the budget.
<p>
The goal of our task force is not simply to "zero out" these Cabinet departments, but rather to examine rational approaches to consolidate, privatize, and/or devolve back to the states their functions.  In our efforts, we adopted the following four principles as our guide:
<ul>
<p>
1) Those programs deemed unnecessary or wasteful are terminated;
<p>
2) Those programs duplicative of other departments or agencies are consolidated;
<p>
3) Those programs that serve a valid purpose are transferred to more appropriate agencies; and
<p>
4) Those programs which can be better performed outside the government will be privatized.
</ul>
<p>
By applying these guiding principles, our Cabinet proposals both reduce the federal spending on, and increase the effectiveness of the truly vital functions of, each department. 
<p>
Now let me turn to our efforts to dismantle the Commerce Department -- the only department slated for elimination in the congressional budget resolution.  As former Commerce Secretary Mosbacher notes, the department is "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  In my judgment, no other department better symbolizes the waste and duplication prevalent in the federal government than Commerce.
<p>
First, many of the department's functions are either duplicated or outperformed by other government agencies and private industry. Its own Inspector General notes that the department has evolved into a "loose collection of more than 100 programs," while the GAO states that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities," sharing its "missions with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."
<p>
Second, its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in disrepair, and more than 60 percent of its resources are dedicated to noncommercial activities. For example, almost 60 percent of the department's $3.6 billion budget is consumed by the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> -- the nation's weather and ocean mapping service.
<p>
Third, many of its programs are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars.  A prime example is the notorious Economic Development Administration.  At some point in its history, 40 percent of the EDA's loans were in default, while economic assistance grants were being distributed to such economically troubled areas as Key Biscayne, Florida.  Even when it is effective, the EDA duplicates the efforts of numerous other programs in other departments.
<p>
Today's Department of Commerce cannot be "reinvented." Its problems can be solved only if it is dismantled. Using the four guiding principles I mentioned earlier, our Commerce legislation would do the following:
<p>
First, we would eliminate unnecessary, duplicative, and wasteful programs such as the EDA, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a>.
<p>
Second, we would transfer the various functions of NOAA -- which comprises the lion's share of the department's budget -- to more appropriate agencies and departments, or to private institutions.  For example, seafood inspection would be transferred to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, which already carries out most food inspection programs.  Marine and estuarine sanctuary management would be transferred to the <a href="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/avads/index.html">Interior Department</a>, which already manages some fisheries.
<p>
Third, we would transfer many of the Commerce Department's trade programs to agencies where their functions may be better performed.  Nineteen distinct federal agencies are charged with promoting U.S. exports, but only 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. Secretary <a href="http://www.doc.gov/misc/BrownBio.html ">Ron Brown</a> may argue that Commerce leads federal efforts at export promotion, but almost three-quarters of the export promotion funds go to the Department of Agriculture, not Commerce. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the very traits that make Commerce a likely target for elimination -- its hodgepodge of unrelated agencies -- also make navigating its elimination through the legislative process extremely difficult.  Commerce offers something for everyone, and our efforts have stepped on a lot of toes. In the end, however, I believe we will prevail for the simple reason that, while one can justify many of the programs under the Commerce umbrella, there is no justification for the umbrella itself.  It's an accident of political evolution, not the product of sound policy.
<p>
For that reason, dismantling the department presents us with the unique opportunity to rationalize many of the functions currently under its jurisdiction, including those functions related to trade.  Let me say at the outset that I am a big proponent of free and expanded trade.  During my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I endorsed the <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Bulletins/nafta.html">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, a politically difficult position to take coming from an industrial state like Michigan.  In fact, I was the only candidate from either party to do so.  Expanded trade does increase American jobs and living standards.
<p>
Clearly, establishing contacts and building trade relationships is important.  But just how effective is the current structure of our federal trade programs?  Opposition to dismantling Commerce comes from two sources -- bureaucrats in the Department who stand to lose their power and prestige, and certain portions of the business community who are concerned about our proposed reforms of the department's trade functions. Their principal concern is that Commerce is essential to promoting American exports abroad.  In fact, in testimony before a House committee the other day, Secretary Brown claimed that the Commerce Department is a "job creator" that builds the economy by increasing exports.
<p>
You might have heard the claim that trade advocacy and counseling efforts by the Commerce Department "returned $10.41 to the federal Treasury for every dollar invested in export promotion."  According to the Department of Commerce, this number and others like it are based upon undefined estimates.  As the Heritage Foundation's Joe Cobb pointed out in testimony Monday before the House Commerce Committee, "estimate" means "made up." Other economists agree. Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute and former economic advisor to Bill Clinton argues that there is "no economics" to the notion that export promotion creates jobs. Shapiro states, "All you can do with them is increase jobs for companies with the clout to get the subsidy. But that's at the expense of industries that don't have the clout. You're just shifting things around."
<p>
None of this is to say that the federal government has no role in promoting international trade.  My legislation begins the important process of consolidating our trade functions by transferring them to more appropriate agencies, thereby increasing their efficiency and effectiveness. As former Commerce official Wayne Berman points out, "You shouldn't negotiate open markets in one department and then try to exploit those open markets in another department. It ought to be a focused, well coordinated effort."
<p>
The Commerce Department Dismantling Act embraces this view by transferring over 70 percent of the International Trade Administration, including the Import Administration and the Foreign Commercial Service offices, to the USTR, creating one office where our trade agreements are negotiated and enforced.  In addition, the legislation creates a series of Industry Advisory Boards composed of representatives from the private sector to provide advice to policymakers and to ensure that industry has a "voice" in any administration.
<p>
Another trade-related agency my bill affects is the Bureau of Export Administration.  As it is currently situated, the Export Administration is criticized for two failings.  According to the defense community, it does a poor job of analyzing risks and protecting U.S. security interests.  Meanwhile, businesses criticize the Administration for being unresponsive to many requests by industry, often sitting on applications for extended periods of time instead of notifying the exporter of possible problems.
<p>
Given these criticisms, I see legislation to dismantle the Department of Commerce as an opportunity to make the Export Administration more responsive through two basic reforms: First, setting a time limit for granting export licenses and second, formalizing, either legislatively or through report language, the inter-agency process by which licensing concerns are raised.  These two reforms would make the BXA a much more effective partner with businesses while protecting our national security.
<p>
In conclusion, let me say that the 104th Congress has a historic opportunity to stop the growth of government and move us toward the limited central government envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Given this opportunity, it would be a tragedy if one of the flagship efforts of the new leadership, the effort to eliminate the Department of Commerce, is defeated.  It will be impossible, in my judgment, to successfully address the massive growth of government and balance the budget if we cannot even address dismantling this department and redesignating its core functions to other agencies.  If we lack the will to do this, it will be virtually impossible to implement the reductions in social service programs that will be necessary to achieve balance.
<p>
My point is this: If we cannot dismantle the Department of Commerce simply because 8 percent of total federal spending on trade promotion must be spent by the department, then where can we cut spending? In my judgment, if we don't dismantle one of the least defensible Cabinet departments, then we won't make the tough decisions to limit spending for other sympathy-engendering spending programs.
<p>
In closing, I believe the goals of the Dole Task Force on Eliminating Government Agencies and those of American industry are the same -- limited government, efficient regulation, low taxes. In that sense, the elimination of the Department of Commerce is more than just a symbol for eliminating government waste;  it's a  key step in downsizing government for the benefit of all Americans. I hope that we can work together to make the elimination of this department a reality.

</i></h3><P>

Backgrounder Update #253<br>
June 16, 1995<br>
<p>
Updating <I>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, May 1995.<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>

 Despite much talk in the Clinton Administration about ending
&quot;corporate welfare,&quot; the Administration actually has
flinched from offering concrete proposals. When President Clinton
released his first Fiscal Year 1996 budget in February, there
were only a handful of proposals to end corporate subsidies. And
when the President unveiled his revised budget blueprint last
week, he recommended only a $25 billion reduction in unspecified
corporate subsidies - and took pride in drawing attention to his
plans to boost spending on two high-technology pork programs slated
for termination by Congress. 
<P>
  The President's weak attack on corporate welfare contrasts sharply
with the way in which Washington policy groups and the new Congress
responded to the Administration's call to trim unnecessary business
subsidies. The Heritage Foundation, along with many other research
organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Progressive Policy
Institute, have reviewed the federal budget and identified dozens
of corporate welfare programs that should be eliminated. In <I>Rolling
Back Government: A Budget Plan to Rebuild America</I>, The Heritage
Foundation identified more than three dozen spending subsidy programs
as corporate welfare that should be reduced or eliminated, producing
more than $100 billion in savings over the next five years. As
the attached table illustrates, many programs were included in
the House and Senate budget proposals, but not in either one of
the President's two budget proposals. 
<P>
 For decades, the federal government has been providing American
businesses with billions of dollars in spending subsidies. These
have been justified by proponents as necessary to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in the world economy, encourage the development
of high technology products and research, maintain a strong national
defense, or assist socially disadvantaged groups. Most of these
spending subsidies are concentrated in three industry groups -
agribusiness, transportation, and energy and natural resources
- to support research, advertising, and other costs of doing business
that achieve these goals.
<P>
 Experience indicates that most spending subsidies for business
do not achieve their goals and are not in America's economic interest.
These subsidies can be expensive and actually hurt the economy.
Subsidizing one business or industry rather than another distorts
private investment decisions, taking resources from more efficient
uses. Over the last ten years, for example, the federal government
has spent, on average, about $14 billion annually subsidizing
production of wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and other commodities.
More than half of farm payments flow to farmers with gross farm
sales in excess of $100,000 annually. This has led to crops being
planted and harvested at great - but subsidized - cost in places
where production is uneconomic. Allowing farmers to make their
production decisions based on market forces rather than government
subsidies would result in a far more efficient farm economy.
<P>
 Some subsidies are just a waste of money, providing little economic
benefit. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is an excellent
example. SBA is supposed to aid the development and expansion
of small businesses through direct and guaranteed low-interest
loans worth more than $11 billion annually. However, SBA's loan
loss rate is greater than that of private lenders, and the U.S.
General Accounting Office (GAO) has questioned whether the SBA's
assistance actually helps stimulate small business development
at all. Other examples of waste include: monies from the $4.6
billion Community Development Block Grant program to pay for swimming
pools, carousel renovations, and other forms of local pork, and
the $17 million spent each year by the U.S. Travel and Tourism
Administration to help the $55 billion tourism industry promote
tourism in the United States.
<P>
 Rather than end corporate welfare, Clinton's budget actually
would add the high technology and information services sectors
to the list of heavily subsidized industries. The nation's economy
has been shifting from manufacturing to a high technology and
information services base. This has been occurring without government
help. But the Clinton Administration wants Congress to enact generous
subsidies to promote high technology products and research. For
example, the President proposes to increase, &quot;by almost $500
million a year by 2002,&quot; the Advanced Technology Program
(ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). In <I>Ending
Corporate Welfare As We Know It</I>, the Cato Institute points
out that in 1994 ATP money went to a number of Fortune 500 firms,
such as AT&amp;T, Shell Petroleum, Inc., Boeing, Inc., and Chevron
Corporation. At the same time the President is proposing to increase
such subsidies, he also is proposing to increase taxes to end
corporate welfare by eliminating a set of still undefined &quot;corporate
loopholes&quot; and &quot;special interest tax breaks.&quot;
<P>
 Spending subsidies too often either enrich those who have already
detected good profit opportunities or direct private capital into
less efficient investments. An example of the latter is the Administration's
support for high speed rail systems. The GAO reported that, without
federal support, such systems are unlikely to be built because
the private sector does not consider them to be financially viable.
The costs of laying one mile of track for a high speed system
can run between $10 million and $20 million. Nevertheless, the
Administration has supported spending as much as $1.3 billion
over five years, even though the American taxpayers might never
see one mile of high speed track. 
<P>
 Taxpayers may recall that programs like this have been proposed
and funded more than once before, only to turn into expensive
white elephants. In the late 1960s, the federal government spent
nearly $1 billion on the Supersonic Transport, which went bankrupt
and never flew a single passenger. In the late 1970s, the federal
government spent more than $2 billion on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation
to produce new forms of energy, but it was shut down without producing
a single kilowatt of power.
<P>
 Only when spending subsidies clearly provide a benefit in the
national interest, such as a strong defense, should they be preserved.
Because it is a legitimate function of the federal government
to provide a national defense, &quot;uneconomic&quot; investments
in the research and development of new defense technology are
justifiable. For example, R&amp;D investments within the Department
of Defense are critical to preserving the nation's security and
cannot be considered corporate welfare - even though they should
be scrutinized carefully for waste. On the other hand, the part
of NASA's budget spent on aeronautical research and development
programs that subsidize R&amp;D for the commercial aircraft industry
should be eliminated.
<P>
 As the House and Senate work on a final budget resolution, lawmakers
must resist the last-minute pressure of corporate special interests,
take a far bolder step than the Clinton Administration, and adopt
the deep cuts in corporate welfare. If Congress does not adopt
the House proposals in the final budget bill, it will show a lack
of will to make even the most basic cuts in spending subsidies,
the true &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; If so, Congress will be
guilty of the same hypocrisy as the Clinton Administration, which
has ignored its own call to end corporate welfare. Congress must
demonstrate evenhandedness in ending wasteful, unnecessary programs
and start making significant cuts in corporate welfare in the
FY 1996 budget.

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

<hr>
<P>
 Even though you pay considerable taxes for police protection,
too often that protection fails, particularly in some areas of
the country that are overwhelmed by crime.  Consequently, many
citizens may feel the need to purchase a gun to protect themselves
and their families from the threat of crime.  What they probably
don't realize is how much they are <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gunoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when
they purchase the gun, merely for the privilege of defending themselves.
<P>
 All gun sales are subject to a 10% Federal excise tax paid directly
by the consumer.  The purchaser must also pay state and local
sales tax, averaging about 6%.  So right off the top, 15% of what
the buyer pays for a legal gun goes to the government in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays for the gun, the manufacturer must pay Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, state and local property taxes, federal payroll
taxes, capital gains taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, business license taxes and fees, and utility
taxes.  For any delivery trucks, the manufacturer must pay gas
taxes, tire excise trucks, truck highway use taxes, and heavy
truck excise taxes.  On the phones in the factory, the producer
must pay telephone excise taxes.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes consume about 30% of what the manufacturer
receives for the sale of a gun.  Counting the excise and sales
taxes paid by the consumer, about 46% of what the purchaser pays
for a legal gun to protect himself and his family ends up going
to the government in taxes rather than for the gun.  So if a good
self-defense weapon costs $200 in total, about $92 of that really
goes for taxes rather than for the gun.  All of the costs of manufacturing,
delivering and selling the gun are paid out of the remaining $108.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

</FONT></A></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">When did the pledge begin?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> Candidates and elected officials began taking
the pledge in 1986.  After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of
1986 was passed, many taxpayers feared that some politicians would
raise income tax rates.  With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups
including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation
of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout
the nation began to ask all candidates for public office to &quot;take
the pledge.&quot;  Every year, all Members of Congress are asked
to take the pledge by Americans for Tax Reform, and all challengers
are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">How many Members of Congress have taken
the pledge?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> As of November 1, 1995, 199 members of the
House of Representatives and 32 members of the Senate have taken
the pledge.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Just what does the pledge commit a Member
of Congress to do</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> The pledge commits a member to oppose and
vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals
or corporations.  The pledge does not stand in the way of any
tax decreases or revenue neutral changes to the income tax.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What if I wanted to trade one tax deduction
or credit for another of equal value?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No problem.  The pledge only opposes changes
in tax deductions or credits that increase the tax burden on Americans.
 Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer has proposed restoring tax
deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed and trading
it for a tax credit of equal value that gives preference to businesses
that sell television and radio stations to certain politically
favored groups.  As this is revenue neutral, the pledge is not
violated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">What about a cut in the capital gains tax
that would increase revenue</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times">?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> A cut in tax rates is always allowed under
the pledge.  Americans for Tax Reform strongly supports reducing
the capital gains tax rate.  All tax rate reductions that increase
revenue due to economic growth are allowable under the pledge
and are greatly desired.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Times">Do I have to take the pledge every time
I run for office?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times"> No.  A candidate only needs to take the pledge
once.  Candidates are always welcome to take the pledge each election
cycle and show their continued support of taxpayers.</FONT>

   Many families today say they need two incomes to make ends meet, and they're right but
not for the reason most people think.  They need two incomes because of the high cost of
government:  one to support themselves, and a second to pay their taxes and support the politicians.<P>  
In recent decades, the government has grown so large so fast that over 40 percent of an average family's earnings is soaked up by taxes.  A typical family now pays more in taxes than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined.<P>
     In addition, Americans today spend 5.4 billion man-hours a year calculating how much they
owe Uncle Sam in taxes.   The overall size of government itself is undermining families'abilities to live the American dream.  That's why I introduced a bill, the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act, designed to cut the size and influence of Washington.  It will revolutionize everything the government does-taxing, spending, and regulating-and allow us to keep more of our money and live the way we believe is right. <P>
     The bill starts by replacing our entire current income tax code with a flat tax.  After seven
decades of abuse by corporate lobbyists and self-righteous income redistributors, our tax code is a mess.  Rates are high, loop-holes abound, and families are burdened as never before.<P>  
My bill would scrap the entire code and start over with a simple, low, flat tax.  Modeled after a
plan that Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka proposed in 1981, it would work like this: You would
add up your earned income, subtract a large personal allowance ($13,100 for a single person,
$26,000 for a married couple filing jointly), take away $5,300 for each child (which is double the
current amount), and then pay a flat 17 percent rate on the remainder.  That's it.  There would be
no special interest deductions or loop-holes of any kind.  You could figure your taxes on a form
as small as a post-card.  In fact, while it takes the average taxpayer 11 hours to do his taxes today, you could this figuring in ll minutes-with no fear that you made a mistake that'll bring out the IRS auditors or missed some clever loopholes that everyone knows about but you.<P>
     Why a 17 percent rate?  That's low enough to give virtually all Americans a major tax cut, but
high enough to meet the government's revenue needs (which will, of course, be reduced under this plan).  With a doubled child deduction, families with children will do especially well.<P>
     Now, the soak-the-rich crowd reflexively claims that a flat tax is by definition unfair.  That's
flat wrong.  Fairness is in fact the flat tax's great virtue.  It's based on the idea of fairness we
learned in grade school : Everyone should be treated the same.  Rather than have fallible
politicians decide which groups should surrender more or less of their earnings to the government, the flat tax sets a single objective standard.<P>
     Indeed, this system will be as progressive as the income tax system we had when John
Kennedy was president.  How so?  The plan's high personal allowance mean that the middle class income folks will pay a far lower portion of their total income to the government than the
wealthy, even if their tax rate is the same.<P>
     A typical family of four, for instance, will pay no income taxes at all on their first $36,800 of
income-the 17 percent rate will only apply to income above that.  As many as 10 million poor
people will be removed from the tax roles entirely.  If you want progressive, this gets the job done without a complicate tax code as long as the Encyclopedia Britanninca.<P>
     Of course, there will be the predictable objections.  Vested interests will fear the loss of such
breaks as the home mortgage deduction.  But by removing the tax code's current punishment for
saving, the plan will swell the capital pool, causing interest rates to drop and demand for housing
to rise.  As housing values hold or increase under the plan-and economic growth soars-only
Washington tax lobbyists will be nostalgic for the old way.  With the flat tax, there will be a single
readily grasped objective standard.  The only thing that matters is whether you have children. 
Otherwise you are treated the same as everyone else.  <P>
     All Americans will benefit mightly form the higher wages and new jobs that such a rational tax
system would be sure to create.  Our twisted tax system today treats investing in new jobs the
same way it treats cigarette smoking-by discouraging it with especially high taxes.    If you want
to put some of your earnings in a stock or mutual fund, that money is hit with double-taxation: it's
taxedwhen you invest it.  No wonder wages have been flat and job growth low.<P>
     The flat tax would end this craziness.  There would, in effect, be no capital gains tax, no tax on dividends or interest, nor would there be a tax on whatever inheritance we try to leave for our
children (why work a lifetime so the government can take half of what you leave behind?).  This
would unleash American talent, work and creativity as never before.  Economic growth would
soar.<P>
     We would still have a tax on business income, of course, but it would be the same flat 17
percent rate that we'd pay on personal income, and a far simpler system for small businesses to
manage than today's ridiculously complicated code.  They would not need to wrestle with
depreciation schedules or other arcania.  They would simply subtract all their expenses from their revenues and pay 17 percent.<P>
     Make no mistake, though, the flat tax is more than just a good government reform to make our tax system simple, fair and pro-growth.  It's a way of telling politicians that we're tired
of being toyed with.   Congress didn't design our tax system to raise revenue for the government
efficiently.  It doesn't do that.  They use it the same they use spending programs-to direct our
money at whatever causes or inerest groups they think are important. 
     Government does not have the competence or the right to make those decisions.  We should
have a tax system that is neutral and let 250 million free Americans decide where their money
should go. <P>
     Oh, and one last thing.  This 17 percent flat tax rate with these personal deductions means a
big tax cut for everyone-especially families who would see their child deduction double. The best
way to keep politicians form spending more and more of other people's money is to reduce their
supply.  Let them cut spending instead. <P>

	<FONT SIZE=+2>G</Font>overnment spends, taxes, and regulates too much.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>f all the crises facing America, this one is paramount.  Many other major national problems flow from this fact or are greatly compounded because of it.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>S</Font>tagnant wages and stifled job growth, urban violence and poverty, and soaring health care and education costs are all closely related to or influenced by the unchecked expansion of the public sector.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	O</Font>n a deeper level, the growth of government is our most critical problem because it so greatly affects the definition of what it means to be an American.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>O</Font>ur government has expanded, it has assumed duties that previously belonged to families and communities, leaving those institutions weaker and government stronger.  A distinct governing class emerged with a taste for power and an appetite for more.  Often relying upon guile, some leaders of this class worked to extend government's intrusive power far beyond what earlier American generations would have tolerated.  Today, we find ourselves staggering under an immense government burden, serving an entrenched elite that in many ways presumes to be wiser and nobler than the rest of us.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>asic American rights should include freedom from unfair demands of distant rulers and the right to use our own efforts to build a better future for our children.  Clearly these rights are being undermined by excessively big government and something is very wrong.  Unrestrained growth of government is a threat to the American Dream.  Consider what runaway governmental power  means to the aspirations of a typical American family.<P>
	"John and Marie Hargas" of Westerville, Ohio, work hard, make mortgage payments, save for their children's college tuition, and give to their church and charities.  Their primary ambition is to make life better for themselves and their two small children.<P>
But each year as April 15 approaches, they typically spend eleven hours filling out IRS forms.  When they're through, they discover that more than a quarter of their income has fled to government bureaucrats five hundred miles away in Washington, D.C.  That amount includes 10.5 percent in direct income taxes, and a whopping 15.5 percent in FICA payroll taxes for payments to Social Security.  The government takes Hargas' earnings from their employers before the Hargases ever see it.  <FONT SIZE=+1>Their state and local taxes take 12.6 percent of their income.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>n all, more than 40 percent of the Hargases earnings support government at all levels.  <Address>That is more than they spend on food, clothing and shelter combined.</Address>  In effect, all the work they do from January 1 to May 6 each year is for government.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>E</Font>very American is entitled to ask these fundamental questions: "Does government really have to cost this much?  Are we really getting our money's worth?  Is this a fair cost for the value we receive from government?"<P>
 <FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>n addition to direct taxes, there is a hidden cost of government that is much more difficult to measure.  That immense additional cost of government is caused by regulations which increase the price of every product and service we buy from peanut butter to cars.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>R</Font>egulations add at least $580 billion in annual costs to U.S. consumers.  That means the Hargases must spend another large part of their income bearing their share of the rule-writers' burden.  According to <BOLD>Americans for Tax Reform</BOLD>, Americans actually labor until <A HREF="/atr/cogdpak.html">July 9</A> before they stop working for the government's ends and begin working for their own.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he Hargases think of themselves as free Americans living in a fair society.  But how free are they really?	In America's peacetime history, never before has government had so much power over family life.<P>
  <FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he U.S. public sector budget is larger than the gross domestic product of any country in the world except for Japan and the U.S. itself.  Since 1950, per capita federal spending has tripled.  Federal spending alone has risen from 16 percent of our 1950 economy to 23 percent in 1991.  By the year 2000, spending could be 27 percent of GNP and reach  31 percent by 2010 unless something is done to reverse the trend. <P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</Font>ased on current projections, the <BOLD>annual federal budget
</BOLD> will reach nearly 
<UL><L1><BOLD>$1.9 trillion by the year 2000,</BOLD> <L1>
<BOLD>$2.7 trillion in 2010</BOLD> <L1><BOLD>$4 trillion by the year 2020.</UL><BOLD>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>	E</Font>ach new dollar government spends and each increase in the size of the government relative to the economy represents an encroachment on the freedom of individual taxpayers.  For people like John and Marie Hargas, that means an ever larger portion of their income will be taken from them.  They will have less control over their lives as the government class, dominated by political professionals, becomes more powerful.  Both the Hargas family and the nation will become poorer as freedom is taken away.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</Font>mericans face a fundamental choice:  Should the government become ever larger as freedom diminishes--or should we take dramatic action now to halt the growth of government and restore greater freedom to our country?<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>T</Font>he "Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act"
 is a way of saying "Enough is Enough."	It is a comprehensive assault on Big Government, designed to halt its growth, expose its true cost, and limit its influence on the lives of free Americans.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>I</Font>t does this by radically reordering the three major activities of the federal government: taxing, spending, and regulating.
<hr noshade=40%><br>
 The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act proposes:<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD>A Flat Tax.</BOLD></FONT>  Scraps the current tax code and replaces it with a simple and neutral tax code based on 17 percent flat tax on all income.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rigid Spending Caps.</BOLD></FONT>   Places unbreachable spending caps on all forms of federal spending to ensure that the federal government will never grow larger in real terms than it is today.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Program Sunsets</BOLD></FONT>.  Forces the true reinvention of government by ending the authorization of  virtually all existing federal spending programs. <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Open Government</BOLD></FONT>.  Exposes the hidden cost of government, ending income tax withholding and 	requiring the government for  the first time to calculate the cost of regulations.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Regulatory Relief</BOLD></FONT>.  Treats regulations much like federal spending, requiring annual calculation of  the total costs to the nation of complying with federal regulations, and providing means for limiting this burden.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Property Rights Protection.</BOLD></FONT>  Secures property rights by requiring the government to compensate landowners whenever federal regulations significantly reduce the value of their property.  <P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>Rational Risk Assessment</BOLD></FONT>.  Requires the government to determine the cost, benefits, and risks of 	all new regulations before it imposes new costs on the economy.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>	The excessive growth of government is the central problem of our time. We need the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act to contain that growth once and for all. </font><P>

<HR>

Their is a new name for tax relief:  "The Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

Armey would vaporize the entire federal income tax code and replace it with a simple plan.  Individual taxpayers would add up all their income form wages, salaries, or pension.  Then they would subtract a generous personnel allowance -- $13,100 for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, or $26,200 for a married couple, plus $5300 for each dependent.  Then they pay a flat 17 percent on what's left.<P>

Thus, a family of four would pay no income tax on income under $36,000.  A family of six -- two parents, four children -- would pay no tax on income under $47,400.<P>

The small business owner would add up total receipts less cash wages and the cost of goods, services, and supplies used in the business, as well as all capital equipment.  Then he or she pays a flat 17 percent on the remainder.  Translation: the business owner pays only a pure tax on business profits as generally conceived, before tax accountants, lobbyists, lawyers, and politicians start messing things up.<P>

The flat tax permits no credits, deductions, exceptions, or loopholes.  There is nothing that allows elected officials a foothold in the system.  Big business plays by exactly the same rules small business does.  Big companies get no special breaks and cannot easily lobby for them.  Business and individuals alike pay taxes only for themselves; they do not become veritable arms of the IRS collecting for other peoples as they do in a sales tax system.<P>

Best of all, there are no depreciation schedules.  Business owners get immediate expensing for all capital purchases.  There is also no inheritance tax.  Your heirs will pay tax on the income your business or farm generates when you leave it to them.  Maintenance of family business or family farms becomes far easier.  The government gets no information about what your financial holdings are.<P>

Armey modeled his proposal on a 1981 plan by Stanford Economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, which many consider the simplest and most elegant tax system ever devised.  The beauty of the flat tax is that it taxes all income, just once, visibly, with no intermediary between government and taxpayer, in a way that allows taxpayers to unite against profligate government.<P>

In keeping with its inherent libertarianism, the flat tax is also perfectly neutral with respect to all economic decisions.  There is no penalty against saving, to be sure, and no double or triple taxation of corporate income.  But on the other hand, there is no bias against saving either.  You can save or consume, spend now or spend later, invest your money wisely or waste it if you will.  You can buy foreign goods and luxury items or the cheapest domestic products, even goods from industries with more or less political protection.  There is no way a government planner can encourage you to spend money one wary or the other with differential taxation.  Your purchasing decisions just don't matter.  The tax in all cases is exactly the same.<P>

Compare the falt tax to our present system, which favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.  Many in big business and the world of policy wonkery say we should tax consumption more to level the playing field.  Armey says no.  We should tax everything, across the board, less.<P>

Armey builds on the fundamental insight that taxes need reforming because taxes are too high and government spends too much.  The current U.S. tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:  once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make the current tax code much less a barrier to long term growth just don't get made.  Politicians won't pay for tax simplification and lower marginal rates even if it means much better economic performance over time.  They would much rather have a little money to buy some nice fresh pork right now.<P>

This why we have a capital gains tax.  Capital gains as now administered is a relatively small levy which costs the economy disastrously in terms of lost economic growth.  There is no economic justifications whatever for the tax, but at least we could lessen its impact by adjusting asset bases for inflation, as the Contract with

	By April 15 in most years or April 17 this year, you have filed your tax returns. Maybe you think you are finished with your obligations to Uncle Sam and  now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor for the rest of the year. Right?<P>
	Not so fast. The taxes you paid are really only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg whose deadly mass remains hidden from view. The bulk of these hidden costs come from deficit spending and added costs to all goods and services which are generated by government regulations.<P>
	 The costs are real, they are just not easy to see.  That's no accident.  For years liberal legislators and activist bureaucrats have used stealth budgets to push the growth of government and mushroom federal spending. When hidden regulatory costs are added to the burdens of direct taxes, the price tag is staggering.<P>
	Consider the 12-month calendar.  If you started working on January 1, you would have to work all the way to July 9, more than half the year, to pay for  costs of both taxes and regulations.  Only then, five days after Independence Day,  are you able to start keeping your hard-earned money for your own needs.<P>
  	Imagine America's founders rolling in their graves at the thought of Americans placed in involuntary servitude to their own government until after July 4. Today's government, with its ferocious appetite for taxpayer dollars, eats away at our economic liberty.  The federal tax system of 1995 makes the English Parliament's Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts and tea duties of 1767, and the Intolerable Acts of 1774 all combined look miniscule in comparison.<P>
	For many years, the Tax Foundation calculated "Tax Freedom Day" as the theoretical calendar day that taxpayers stop working to pay direct taxes.  This year, Tax Freedom Day is May 6.<P>
  	But almost every year since 1969, the federal government has spent several percentage points of GNP more than it takes in from taxes. "Spending Freedom Day" therefore is a date still later (May 16) which marks the day Uncle Sam stops spending the combined earnings of all citizens.  Right now, the national debt has a huge impact on the budget.  Three percent of GNP must be devoted just to pay interest on the debt.  That's more money for interest than for national defense.<P>
	But Tax Freedom Day and Spending Freedom Day don't fully measure the true burden that Washington imposes on citizens.  Why?  Because regulations generated by federal agencies drive up the prices of everything produced or sold in America including services.  The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes.<P>
   	In 1993, Americans for Tax Reform Foundation originated the idea of calculating the additional days that Americans had to work to pay for regulations beyond Tax Freedom Day and called it "Cost of Government Day."   The purpose of Cost of Government Day is to help people understand the true cost of government's tax and regulatory burden combined.<P>
 	Cost of Government Day is the total percentage of Net National Product consumed by government spending and estimated total regulatory costs.  Government spending is projected in the president's budget forecast.  A reasonable estimate of federal regulatory costs can be made from a 1992 study by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas Hopkins.<P>
 	This year, July 9 is Cost of Government Day.  That is the date beyond Tax Freedom Day that Americans have earned enough in gross income to pay off their share of government-imposed financial obligations.  It moves later in the year as government spending and hidden taxes increase.<P>
	For two years, we have been paying for President Clinton's 1993 tax hikes.  Every time we buy gasoline we pay higher excise taxes.  Every time we buy groceries or clothing, we pay the so-called "millionaire's" tax.  That tax was supposed to "soak the rich" but really hit small business operators who file personal income taxes rather than corporate income taxes.<P>
	State and local taxes have also increased due to Clinton administration policies.  Unfunded federal mandates and regulations imposed by past Congresses or activist bureaucrats have forced state or local government to spend more money and raise taxes to pay for the mandate.<P>
 	For example, in 1970, Illinois was a leader among states that designed special education programs for children with developmental disabilities.  The programs are costly.  But citizens of that state supported spending money to make sure children with special needs were offered as many educational opportunities as circumstances permitted.<P>
	But Congress took a good idea and ran amok with the passage of Public Law 94-142.  Opportunities became "rights" which imposed massive costs on local school districts all over the country.  Federal regulations made it nearly impossible for school administrators to make common-sense distinctions between special educational costs and purely medical ones.  School boards began to ask if it is really fair that a single student with special needs could cost a district more than $100,000 per year without federal reimbursement that Congress promised when the law passed.<P>
	This pattern of political excess permeates everything Congress did for decades from unjustified increases in federal deposit insurance to unjustified micromanagement of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Mayor Gregory S. Lashutka of Columbus, Ohio, describes unfunded mandates this way:  "It's like having your Uncle Sam take you to lunch, order your food, and then hand you the check."<P>
	But by far the most expensive silent taxes are federal regulations and unfunded mandates on private business.  In 1993 and 1994, President Clinton's allies in Congress approved a towering stack of new regulations.   The new rules combined with all previous regulations, cost Americans more than $700 billion, or $2,800 per person, in 1994.<P>
	But we should count our blessings.  Had the Clinton administration's 1993 plan for a national health care system become law, Cost of Government Day would be approximately one month later.  We would be working for government well into August.<P>
	In November, 1994, a decisive majority of voters asked for change in the direction Congress has traveled for decades.  Much of that desire for change was fueled by citizens who believed the burden of mandates on state and local governments and regulations on private employers has become far too heavy compared to the benefits that those regulations were supposed to realize.<P>
 	Much evidence suggests the regulatory revolt which shook ballot boxes last November has plenty of steam left. California, for example, faces a ticking time bomb.  Golden State voters are circulating petitions for a hugely popular initiative that would eliminate affirmative action regulations and save the state billions of dollars every year.  Affirmative action programs were originally designed to redress past unjustified discrimination in society at large.  But many have evolved as a system which awards jobs, contracts, scholarships, and academic degrees by arbitrary quotas based on gender or racial identification rather than on merit or qualifications of an applicant.   The nationwide costs of affirmative action programs are estimated at $25 billion per year.<P>
	Indirect costs (not included in Cost of Government Day) of filling out paperwork, reorganizing the workplace, and lost time are in excess of $100 billion per year, according to a 1993 Forbes magazine estimate.   Consider some other examples of regulatory excess which concern voters:
1. Last September, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relied on a one-paragraph petition by a botanist at the University of California, Davis, to declare three varieties of "fairy shrimp" in Sacramento to be an "endangered" species.  Even though millions of the hardy shrimp are found in irrigation ditches and ponds in California, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, the "endangered" designation caused the closing of a pony ranch that housed a program for needy and disabled children.  The action could cost the Sacramento housing industry $500 million.<P>
2. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is using the 1990 Clean Air Act to create the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  This regulation mandates companies with more than 100 employees located in high-smog urban areas to force a percentage of workers to use carpools.  Violations can cost $25,000 each.  As Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> noted, "The real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers-not the government or the EPA-into the bullyboy."<P>
3. Republican congressional leaders and California initiative backers are leading a national crusade to rein in the cost of lawsuits.  Tort settlements cost the nation at least $150 billion per year.  Creighton Hale, CEO of Little League Baseball, wrote in The Wall Street Journal about a volunteer coach who was sued for pain, suffering, and punitive damages after one of his outfielders was beaned by a pop fly.  A Girl Scouts of America spokesperson told the newspaper that the Scouts must sell 87,000 boxes of cookies annually to pay liability premiums.  So far, the Clinton administration has no plan for major tort reform.  Some observers speculate that Clinton policy could be influenced by the fact that individual trial lawyers donated $470,000 to the president's 1992 primary campaign, according to a CNN report.  Trial lawyers, many of whom collect large percentages of tort case settlement fees, are strongly opposed to any caps on jury awards.<P>
 	The best hope for reversing the damage done by excess spending and regulatory programs is a fully informed citizenry which understands the true costs that regulations impose on their lives.  One of the first bills in the Contract with America to pass the new Congress was one to make it more difficult for Congress to impose unfunded mandates on states without careful economic-impact studies and guarantees of federal money to reimburse state costs.  President Clinton has signed this new law.  The unfunded mandates law should have the impact of slowing down thoughtless federal regulations.<P>
  	Other reforms on the GOP congressional agenda include tort reform, slowing the rate of yearly increases in spending, regulatory reform, property rights protections, pension reform, and returning powers and duties for certain programs back to the states.  When fully implemented, these reforms could move Cost of Government Day earlier in the year by several weeks.	A national consensus needs to determine how much of the fruits of our labor we are willing to surrender to support government.<P>

	<BOLD>We all know that federal, state, and local governments have grown much too large, too intrusive, and too costly. But you may not fully realize just how costly government  has become.<P>
	The average taxpayer works from January 1 to May 6 just to pay taxes. That's every penny we earn for over four months. Only then can we begin to keep money we earn to buy housing, food, and clothing to take care of our families.</BOLD><P>
	Direct taxes are only part of the problem.  When we add the regulatory burden on American businesses and individuals, the average American works until July 9 to pay both taxes and the true cost of regulations. <P>
	This is out of hand. Together, we can begin to turn America around and restore individual liberty, accountability, and responsibility.<P>
	On Nov. 8, 1994, exactly five years after the Berlin Wall fell, Americans rejected the costly failures that 40 years of extreme liberal policies in Congress had brought us.<P>
	Americans who had committed so much time, energy, and treasure to defeating Soviet imperialism, could now focus on repairing the damage that Imperial Washington has caused in their lives.  We have only just begun to turn the corner.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) works in cooperation with hundreds of state and local taxpayer groups to fight against any and all tax hikes.<P>
	Every year ATR asks all Members of Congress and candidates to sign the Taxpayer Protection Pledge committing lawmakers to oppose any and all income tax increases.  To date, 196 members of the House of Representatives and 30 members of the Senate have signed ATR's pledge.  Of the candidates for president:  Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Robert Dornan, Lamar Alexander, Pat Buchanan,  Alan Keyes, and Arlen Specter have taken the pledge.  Bill Clinton, and Richard Lugar have refused to make this commitment to taxpayers.	ATR also works with state and local taxpayer groups to ask candidates for state legislatures to sign a State Taxpayer Protection Pledge against tax hikes.<P>
	Our goal is to stop tax increases.  This will force politicians to focus on cutting spending, eliminating programs, and returning resources to taxpayers who earn them.<P>
	This is a containment strategy against big government.  Just as the Soviet Empire was told it could not grow by conquest, so too must big government first be told it cannot grow unrestrained as a parasite on the economy.  It must be rolled back and once again become the people's servant, rather than a master.<P>
	 ATR looks forward to working with every taxpayer and every interested group to restrain oversized government.  Just as importantly, our affiliate, the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF),  sponsors research and education projects which help inform Americans about the true cost of government. <P>
	 As taxpayer advocate Howard Jarvis wrote, "Death and taxes may be inevitable, but being taxed to death is not"<P>
	As publisher, I take pride in welcoming you to this first issue of our new ATRF newspaper.   American Tax Reformer is dedicated to informing you about current issues in the tax reform movement.  Our goal is to distribute American Tax Reformer to an increasingly wider audience in the general public through libraries, universities, gift subscriptions for students, and other means.  In this way, we hope to fulfill the primary educational mission of the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation.  We hope you like this issue and that you will write us with your comments.<P>

<A NAME="Donuhue">	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist was a guest on Phil Donahue's TV show on May 26.  Norquist appeared with Richardson Foundation President Heather Higgins, former TV actor Ben Jones, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to discuss how Congress has changed under the new House Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)<P>
	Jones, a frequent Gingrich political rival and critic, played the part of a Deputy Sheriff named "Cooter" on a 1980's TV series called <ADDRESS>The Dukes of Hazzard.</ADDRESS>  In the wide-ranging discussion, the usually boisterous Phil Donahue audience almost could not get a word in edgewise since the panelists' debate was so lively.<P>
	Hard and fast conclusions are hard to reach in the Donahue format, but few viewers were surprised to hear that Norquist and Higgins found great merit in the first 100 days of the Gingrich speakership whereas Rep. Frank and Ben Jones were quite grumpy about the direction of the new Congress.  Stay tuned.<P></a><CENTER><a href="/atr/bar4.map"><img src="/atr/bar4.gif" ismap border="0"></a>  </CENTER><p>



<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="rock">  Rock the House!</a></center></bold><FONT></p>

	Early July marks the publication of Rock the House, a new book by ATRF President Grover G. Norquist which puts the 1994 elections under a microscope.  With an initial press run of one million copies, Rock the House is certain to become the definitive explanation of how the old Roosevelt Coalition unraveled and was replaced by a conservative coalition as the governing majority in America.<P>
	Norquist believes the Contract with America was central to what happened last November, and he sees it as a model for future politics in America.  The Contract produced an honest connection between campaign promises and policy fulfillment that is all too rare in any election.  People knew what they were voting for, and they now have a standard against which to measure the performance of the elected.<P>
	Rock the House examines the pluses and minuses of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations and provides a road map for the future. Watch for Rock the House in bookstores this summer. Visa and Mastercard customers may call 1-800-201-7625 to order your copy for $9.65 plus $1.50 for shipping and handling.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><bold><a name="court">Court Blocks Term Limits</bold></FONT></a><p></center>

<p>
 	The U.S. Supreme Court decided on May 22 by a 5 to 4 decision that Arkansas and 22 other states could not limit the terms of members of Congress from those states.  Justice John Paul Stevens  wrote an 88-page opinion which devoted a great deal of space to the merits of term limits as a public policy.  That is somewhat unusual since the merits of the policy should not have been an issue before the court, only the power of the states to decide the policy for themselves.  In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that the Constitution was silent on the question of whether or not states could determine limits for the terms of its members of the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
	The 22nd Amendment was passed by Congress in 1947 and ratified in 1951. Beginning with President Dwight Eisenhower, that amendment set a limit of two four-year terms for president.  Before that time, the Constitution was silent on limiting the president's term and every president except Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to seek no more than eight years in office.<P>
	The Supreme Court decision seems to close the door on all state and federal legislation on term limits which leaves a constitutional amendment as the only remaining option. A vote in the House in April to limit terms by constitutional amendment was part of the GOP Contract with America.  But backers failed by 61 votes to attain the necessary two-thirds majority.<P>
   		Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has stated the Senate will likely vote on a constitutional amendment this summer. Public opinion polls show 75 to 80 percent of Americans favor term limits.  The decision did not upset term limits for state and local offices.  National and state term limits organizations are planning now to make term limits an issue in the 1996 elections.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD><CENTER>Initiatives and Referenda</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>

	When Congress refuses to deal with an issue, activists often go to state legislatures to fight for change.  Welfare reform is an example of an issue ignored by Washington, D.C., and championed by state leaders like Gov. John Engler (R-Mich.), Gov. Tommy Thompson (R-Wisc.), and others.<P>
	But when Washington, D.C., and state capitals hide their heads in the sand or man the barricades in defense of the status quo, citizens in 24 states can turn to the initiative process.  Initiatives allow citizens to gather a specified number of signatures of voters on a petition to place a law or constitutional amendment on the state ballot.<P>
	This was the case when Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann placed Proposition 13 on the California ballot in June of 1978.  Proposition 13 cut property taxes in half and just as importantly required a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature to approve any state tax increase.  Other states followed with similar initiatives on the November 1978 ballot.  The subsequent success of taxpayer groups in using the initiative process helped to convince President Ronald Reagan to support the Kemp-Roth tax cut that eventually passed in 1981.  Thus local and state taxpayer groups started a tidal wave using the initiative process at the state level which also influenced federal legislation.<P>
	In 1990, the term limits movement began the long march through the states using the initiative process.  In spite of opinion polls which showed overwhelming public support for limits of six years for U.S. Representatives and 12 years for U.S. Senators, congressional leaders such as former House Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) refused to allow a vote on term limits in either the House or Senate.  Worse, they used tax money to pay for attorneys who filed lawsuits against state term limit ballot questions.<P>
	Most members of state legislatures were usually no more enthusiastic than most members of Congress were about the move to limit their own terms of office.  But fortunately, the voters had one more option: the initiative process.<P>
	Success came in recent years when 21 states passed term limits with an average approval majority of 65 percent.  This groundswell created the right climate to persuade U.S. House Republican leaders that a promise to vote on a constitutional amendment to limit terms of lawmakers should be included in the "Contract with America."<P>
  	This spring, the first vote ever held on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to limit terms received support from a solid majority of House members, but less than the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution.  None of this could have happened unless the national organization called U.S. Term Limits had prepared the ground by leading fights at the state level using the initiative process.<P>
	Most recently, the drive to abolish affirmative action including racial quotas and set-asides in government contracts has been energized by backers of the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI).  CCRI supporters plan to place that initiative on the California ballot in 1996.  Supporters believe the CCRI is needed to strike down all government racial quotas and reintroduce employment and business opportunities where men and women may be judged by the merit of their qualifications and content of their character rather than the color of their skin.  Activists in Colorado and other states are exploring ways to copy the CCRI in their states.  For a copy of CCRI, call Kolt Jones in the ATR Washington, D.C., office at 202-785-0266.<P>
<p>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 WIDTH=100%>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2><BOLD>Super  Majority States
</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>
	Another major reform that is sweeping the nation through the initiative process is a requirement that legislatures may only approve tax increases by a super majority, not just a simple majority.  For example, in 1992 Arizona passed a requirement that any tax increase must receive the approval of two-thirds of both the state house and state senate.  In 1994, Nevada passed a similar two-thirds requirement with 79 percent of the vote.  That state will vote again on the measure since two separate votes of approval by the people are required in that state.<P>	
	Initiative supporters in Ohio, Florida, Montana, and other states are planning to sponsor ballot questions in November 1996 that would approve constitutional amendments to make it more difficult to raise taxes.  California may vote in March of 1996 on a measure to require either a two-thirds vote of the legislature or a two-thirds vote of the people for any tax increase to pass.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform hosts a monthly conference call on the initiative process which includes leaders of state initiative measures.  The telephone discussion usually lasts for one hour and covers the progress of various state efforts.  If you know of an initiative or plan to sponsor one in your state, please call Kolt Jones at 202-785-0266 to learn more about how to participate in the conference call.<P>

Term Limits</CENTER></FONT></BOLD><P>


	Until the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its May 22 decision which banned state legislation imposing congressional term limits, many states had used the initiative process to place term limit questions on the ballot.<P>
	Before the decision, 21 states had passed congressional term limits by popular vote of the people, usually by overwhelming majorities.  One state that allows initiatives, Utah, passed the provision in the state legislature.  In early May, the New Hampshire legislature became the first assembly in a non-initiative state to pass congressional term limits.  The governor of New Hampshire signed the bill on May 15.<P>
	Almost before the ink was dry on the New Hampshire statute, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the laws of all 23 states which had acted to impose congressional term limits.  Before the decision, more than 90 percent of states which allow some kind of initiative or referendum process had adopted congressional term limits.<P>
	Currently, 20 states have passed measures which impose term limits on state legislators.  Limits on the terms of state officials will remain in force since they were not overturned by the Supreme Court decision which affects only congressional term limits.  This November, citizens of Mississippi will vote on an initiative that will place term limits on all state legislators and local elected officials.

	There are several different initiatives that have "responsibility" as their main message.  In the state of Ohio, Lee Donaho, Executive Director of the National Taxpayers Union of Ohio, has been working on an initiative that would force the legislature to require a three-fifths super majority to enact any new taxes or new tax increases.

Sunshine State Tax Cap</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>


	David Biddulph, President of the Florida Tax Cap Committee, has a similar initiative that requires two-thirds of the vote of the people to raise taxes.  Voting on your own tax increases?  Yes, 10 states now have the ability to say whether or not they will receive a tax increase.  People in these states can feel the difference too, the tax burden rose nearly 20 percent faster in states without a super majority to raise taxes.<P>
 	 Last year, the need for tax restraint was recognized, discussed, and fought for by the people.  The American people were given the chance to limit government, and they did.  Realizing the impact the I&R process could have, bureaucrats are making the initiative process more time-consuming, bureaucratic, expensive, and out of reach to many American citizens looking for the justice that the initiative process preserves elsewhere. <P>

"Contract with Passaic"</FONT></BOLD></CENTER><P>


	On May 9,  four incumbents on the Passaic, New Jersey, city council lost their seats to members of the Passaic Homeowners and Taxpayers Association.  The challengers signed a contract with the citizens of Passaic pledging a 20 percent reduction in taxes.<P>
	The contract contains 10 "common sense points" that will lessen the tax burden of the residents as well as improve the use of their tax money.  Included among these points are provisions to reduce taxes over a three year period (10 percent for FY 1996 and 5 percent for FY 1997 and 1998), reduce city spending to mirror tax decreases, and a freeze on unnecessary municipal hiring and pay increases without council review. <P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>J</FONT>ackie Gleason loved to tell a story about an old priest from a poor village in Ireland who had never before stayed in a hotel.  Invited to visit New York City for the first time in 1959 as the guest of a foundation, the priest checked in to the Waldorf Astoria.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>A</FONT> bell boy carried the clergyman's luggage to his room, opened the drapes, set out glasses and linen, hung clothes in the closet, and performed all manner of service.  Expecting a tip, as the young man started to leave he placed his hand palm up in front of the priest.  Unfamiliar with the gesture, the priest shook the bell boy's hand and thanked him heartily.<P>
	<FONT SIZE=+2>"F</FONT>ather, you don't understand," the bell boy explained  "In this country, it's customary for guests to give us a tip."   The priest was embarrassed since he had no money, but he had an idea.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="capblue.gif"><br>

	<FONT SIZE=+2>"W</FONT>ell then," replied the priest, hoping to be of service,  "kneel down and bow your head while I give you the pledge."<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>hen that priest was young, many men "took the pledge" to shun the excesses of alcohol.  Some took it often and just as often fell short of full compliance.  But the act itself was a sincere promise to try to do better, which is all anyone could ask.<P>

 <IMG ALIGN=TOPRIGHT SRC="wwwelf.gif">Father Robert Sirico<P>

	In Grand Rapids, Mich., the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty recently launched a one-year welfare reform program which includes four separate projects.  The first project was a highly successful conference held March 29 in Washington, D.C., attended by 200 welfare policy researchers and administrators.  Key speakers included House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Michigan Gov. John Engler (R), and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith (R) of Indianapolis, Ind.  Two other special Acton projects include welfare reform publications and a speaker's tour.<P>
	The fourth project is a national "better charity" competition to recognize "compassionate, effective, and innovative charitable programs."  Father Robert A. Sirico, president of the Acton Institute, announced in May the institute will award $40,000 in grants to individuals and organizations working to solve social and economic problems.<P>
	"Our Samaritan Awards are a way to honor the accomplishments of creative charities and share their techniques and know-how with others seeking to help the needy," said Fr. Sirico.  He noted that the ideal award-winning programs would be those that help individuals strengthen ties with their family, friends, and community and foster self-reliance and self-esteem by addressing both spiritual and material needs.<P>
	Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF) President Grover Norquist says he welcomes projects like the Acton Institute idea which look for practical solutions to the costly welfare state.  "It's not enough to oppose government-provided welfare systems, we need to find superior alternatives," said Norquist.<P>
	Three winning model programs will each be awarded $10,000 and there will be $1,000 awards for each of ten finalists.  The entry deadline for Samaritan Awards is July 15, 1995.  Applications and more information may be obtained by writing to The Acton Institute, 161 Ottawa Ave., N.W., Suite 301, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503 or by calling the Institute at 616-454-3080.<P>  

Rabbi Daniel Lapin<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ww1.gif">
<p><p>Mazel Tov, Mr. Speaker 
	In January, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, president of Toward Tradition, met with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and came away heartened by the speaker's receptiveness to this fairly new organization's message: that new public policy initiatives need a moral grounding, which can be found in Scripture and in Jewish religious traditions.  Speaker Gingrich expressed the hope that more Jewish conservatives will take part in the political process.<P>
	Toward Tradition was founded in 1991.  Its membership includes both Jews and Christians who believe that the success of America's experiment in free government, in the service of a just and good society, depends on maintaining the strong foundation of values that are emphasized in the Judeo-Christian heritage.<P>
  	Rabbi Lapin says neither the Jewish community's spiritual heritage nor its practical interests are best served when the community is chiefly aligned with policies that push the excessive growth and power of government at the potential expense of personal freedom.  To emphasize this point, Toward Tradition took out an advertisement in The New York Times on December 16, 1994, which supported the Contract with America.<P>
	The ad was entitled,  "Mazel Tov, Speaker Gingrich -- We Know All About 10 Point Contracts."  <Address>Mazel tov </Address> is Hebrew for congratulations.  While the ad caused controversy in New York and even provoked responding counter advertisements from more liberal Jewish organizations, it nevertheless generated positive responses as well and focused attention on the Contract debate.  A framed copy of the advertisement now hangs in the speaker's office.<P>
	Since January, Rabbi Lapin has been busy on the lecture circuit talking about how spiritual heritage influences policy questions and is writing a new book.  In addition, he has become the regular host of the Monday night (9:00-11:00) talk show slot on radio station KVI in Seattle, Wash.<P>
  	Toward Tradition is planning a major poll of the American Jewish community to survey current attitudes on policy questions since the majorities in Congress changed in January.

Subsidies Cost
</FONT></center></bold><HR NOSHADE SIZE=2 WIDTH=30%>


	ATR recently issued a list of corporate welfare spending programs and government subsidies that should be the first things on the chopping block when Congress pares down the budget.  Leading the list were a number of outdated energy programs that serve few people, yet cost us all dearly.   Direct and indirect subsidies to government-owned utilities alone cost American consumers billions of dollars annually.  ATR supports the elimination of the Department of Energy, privatization of the Power Marketing Administrations, and the elimination of the Rural Utilities Service.<P>
	ATR President Grover Norquist recently said, "We need to get government out of trying to run businesses.  Just look at the mess the government has made of the electric utility industry.  Directand indirect subsidies are taking close to $10 billion out of taxpayers' pockets annually and throwing them at government-owned electric utilities who also receive tax breaks.  At a time when all Americans have been forced to tighten their belts and Congress has to make tough decisions about the new budget, it is absurd to even consider continuing these wasteful spending programs.<P>
	"One of the things the government of Poland learned is that privately-run companies don't need subsidies and bailouts.  Bill Clinton's energy policies should learn from the failures in Eastern Europe, not emulate them.  It's time to privatize and get the government out of the energy business.  The government simply does not need to be in the electric utility industry -- either directly, through subsidies, or through special tax breaks.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="reptnote.gif"><P>

	One of the most widely read political columns in America is "Potomac Watch" by Paul A. Gigot in The Wall Street Journal.  When he isn't sparring with analyst Mark Shields on <ADDRESS>The McNeil/Lehrer News Hour,</ADDRESS> Gigot is spotting new trends and personalities.  Gigot's April 14 "Potomac Watch" column described the impact that ATR and ATR President Grover Norquist are having on Washington's agenda.<P>
  	Calling Norquist the "V.I. Lenin of the anti-tax movement," Gigot explains that while once candidates for president courted the endorsement of other major office holders, now they seek support from groups like ATR that emphasize communications with local cadres.  Gigot points out that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave UsAlone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Real political clout rests with issue-driven activists who can mobilize grassroots networks."  Enter Mr. Network, Grover Norquist.<P>
 	"Mr. Norquist founded his group, Americans for Tax Reform, in 1985, and he now communicates with 1,800 state and local tax outfits."  Gigot point outs that Grover is a key organizer of meetings of many groups in what he calls the "Leave Us Alone" coalition that resists excessive federal intervention in American life.<P>
	"Mr. Norquist is the Grand Central Station of this coalition," writes Gigot.  He also points out that just before Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) announced for president, he started off his campaign by joining Grover Norquist for a photograph to sign the ATR Taxpayer Protection Pledge.<P>
	Well there you have it.  Gigot metaphors describe the ATR president as a deceased Bolshevik, a New York train station, and the bosses of Tammany Hall.  Not a bad combination.<P>

	The Economist is Britain's widely respected contribution to readers of international finance and political trends.  The magazine's "American Survey" department for the April 15-21 issue took note of a new book by ATRF President Grover Norquist called <ADDRESS>Rock the House.</ADDRESS> Comparing the Norquist world view with that of President Clinton's pollster Stanley Greenberg in another new book, a correspondent for The Economist writes:  "Mr. Norquist thinks Mr. Greenberg is in denial.  It is not the party order that is collapsing, it is the Democratic Party.  Meanwhile, the Republican coalition, as he calls it, is going from strength to strength."<P>

	The ultimate political trade publication in Washington is a slick magazine called Campaigns and Elections.  The May issue devotes one page to ATR's own fuzzy curmudgeon, describing Grover Norquist as one of the town's "Movers and Shakers."  The magazine asked Grover what he would do if he were president (of the country  that is - not just ATR) for one day.  Grover's reply:  "I would fire everybody in government and quit.  Then lock the doors to the White House and Congress, so no one could get back in."  Who says hyperbole can't make a legitimate and humorous point.  That is, if it was hyperbole.<P>

	GQ may not be the first publication that comes to mind when one thinks about news coverage of public policy makers.  But lo and behold, there in the May issue with Mel Gibson on the cover is an earnest looking ATR President Grover Norquist looking out at readers from an article by John B. Judis titled "Newt's Gang."  Grover is flanked by a rogues' gallery of conservative policy strategists such as Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner, <ADDRESS>American Spectator</ADDRESS> publisher Emmet Tyrrell, and the CATO Institute President Ed Crane.  The subtitle of the article is "Meet the Real Establishment."  This group was not chosen for its snappy sartorial ensembles. That's why cinema heartthrob Mel Gibson is still on the cover.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>TV COVERS DAY OF OUTRAGE </FONT>
<P>

	ATR members and friends focused national TV attention on the burden of federal taxation on Saturday, April 15, during a rally across the street from the White House in LaFayette Park.  Speakers included Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) and the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation (ATRF), Amy Moritz, President of The National Center for Policy Research; Dr. Marlo Lewis, Jr., Executive Director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute; Fran Smith, Executive Director of Consumer Alert; Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst for Citizens for a Sound Economy; Peter Ferrara, Senior Fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis; and Wes Anderson, former Executive Director of Frontiers of Freedom.<P>
	"This protest is for millions of taxpayers who are angry about high taxes, pork-barrel spending, and the growth of the federal bureaucracy," said Norquist.  The Washington, D.C., rally was one of several at sites around the country organized by taxpayer groups under the banner of "Day of Outrage."  Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night.  More than 60 major net-work-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.<P>
	"We will be protesting, as our forefathers did in Boston Harbor, that runaway tax and spend government policies must stop now," Norquist said.<P>
	Dozens of protestors signalled their approval of remarks by blowing on plastic duck calls with a "no new taxes" slogan printed on each one.<P>
  	Both CBS and CNN ran network stories that night. More than 60 major network-affiliated TV stations as well as independents in major markets ran stories about the rally.  This level of coverage shows that ATR is taken seriously by major media.  Here is a partial list of broadcast reports in major cities which covered this significant ATR rally reaching tens of millions of viewers.

Flat Tax Alternative</FONT>
	Thank you for your prompt response to my request for information on the "flat tax" proposals.  It will help me answer and ask appropriate questions when dealing with neighbors, our local candidates, and radio talk show hosts.<P>
	Two reasons for my interest are:<P>
	1.  I am an American citizen paying taxes to a government which doesn't have a responsible attitude toward spending.<P>
	2.  I plan on starting a small home-based business and even though I am a bookkeeper, the tax laws are presently so confusing that I dread even thinking about April 15, 1996.<P>
	Your ideas are responsible and simplified.  I have contact with many people who would like to receive your "taxpayer action alerts."<P>

<P>
	I have just finished Martin Gross's book "A Call for Revolution" and have run across your organization in a list in the appendix.<P>
	I was one of the citizens convinced of Washington's inefficiencies and excesses long before I read Mr. Gross's book, but I am now inspired to advocate the idea of practical steps towards rationalization and reduction of the super wasteful spending of our seemingly irresponsible governments.  I would welcome and hope to participate in the advocacy of every suggestion Mr. Gross makes, and hope that your organization may provide a channel for that endeavor.  Please be so kind as to send me whatever information you disseminate about your organization and a list of activities.  I would also like a history of your efforts if  you have one or a list of publications which can educate me concerning your public record.<P>

Grover Norquist's new book, <address>Rock the House</address>, is a lively, penetrating account of how the GOP triumphed last November, an election that dramatically underscored the desire of Americans for a fundamental break from the liberal/Beltway politics of the past 30 years.What helps make Norquist's chronicle so superb is that he was absolutely instrumental in helping bring about this positive, seismic shift.

<h2>The FCC and the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Putting Competition on Hold?</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, II and Jeffrey A. Eisenach
<a href="compfoot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
After years of hard work, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law designed to "provide a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework … by opening all telecommunications markets to competition."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#1">1</A></sup>  The bill has been heralded by leaders of both major political parties as a significant step toward moving America's telecommunications system into the digital age.However, as many of us pointed out at the time, the Act did not guarantee a deregulatory outcome.  Instead, it gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulatory commissions permission to pursue deregulation.  Unfortunately, the early signs suggest the FCC has gone in the opposite direction, attempting to use the Act to expand its regulatory authority.  
<p>
The best evidence that the Commission has gone astray is its massive "interconnect" order, issued this August.  Intended to implement the provisions of the Act requiring competition in local telephone service, the order established a complex and pervasive system of Federal price regulation, effectively pre-empting the process of private negotiations and state oversight Congress intended as the means to achieve competitive markets.
<p>
This month, acting at the behest of state regulators, local telephone companies and others, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC's rules, pending a hearing scheduled for early next year.  Thus, by overreaching and failing to abide by the Act's intent, the FCC has allowed the entire process of telecommunications deregulation to be placed, at least in part, "on hold."  The new rules -- and the litigation they have inspired -- will in all likelihood delay the advent of competition for local telecommunications services.  And, as the FCC moves to implement other provisions of the Act -- including its universal service provisions -- the new rules send a worrisome signal that the Commission still views itself as the regulatory czar of the telecommunications marketplace.
<p>
<CENTER><B>The 1996 Act and Congressional Intent</B></CENTER>
<p>
The intent of Congress in the Telecommunications Act was clear: to open up local telephone networks to competition, principally through the interconnection of telephone networks so that all carriers can compete and complete the calls of their customers. However, the Act, like many such massive bills, speaks only in broad terms, leaving tremendous discretion to the FCC and to state Public Utility Commissions charged with implementing its provisions. 
<P>
According to the Act, the interconnection process is to be driven principally through negotiations among the carriers competing in the market.  Congress considered private negotiations, not regulatory fiat, to be the best means of moving rapidly toward a competitive telecommunications industry.  Congress gave the FCC authority to implement the interconnection policy contained in the Act through the adoption of overall guidelines, but did not intend for the FCC to write detailed requirements governing every aspect of interconnection agreements.  That was supposed to be left to the market and to the states, which are authorized to act as arbitrators in cases where interconnection negotiations break down.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Implementation:  Undermining the Law</B></CENTER>
<p>
In some areas of implementation, such as the entry of the Baby Bell telephone companies into video, the FCC seems to accept the broad deregulatory intent of the Act.  But in the interconnection proceeding, the FCC adopted a very heavy-handed, regulatory approach. In its August 1996 "interconnect" order, consisting of more than 1,400 single-spaced pages and 3,200 footnotes, the FCC issued minutely detailed regulations governing local-loop competition.<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#2">2</A></sup>  The rulemaking addresses nearly 10,000 issues and sub-issues, and adopts meticulous directives for many of them.  Among the egregious examples of over-regulation is a requirement on how to allocate square footage in a telephone company central office, including how floor plans must be devised.  There is even a requirement that phone companies check with their competitors before remodeling.
<p>
The FCC's approach to implementing the Act demonstrates its lack of faith in the ability of the market and states to promote competition in telecommunications.  For instance, the FCC regulations determine in detail the manner in which interconnection should occur, leaving little room for private negotiations among competitors.  The FCC expressly rejected the prospect that individual states might implement the Act in ways tailored to local market conditions, suggesting that such an approach would create too great an administrative burden for Federal regulators.  Instead, the rules provide for a national baseline for companies to follow in negotiating the price and manner of interconnection agreements.  These provisions usurp from the states their historic authority to regulate local telephony and reduce their role to merely checking that the FCC's rules are followed.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Back in Court</B></CENTER>
<p>
After years of difficult negotiation in Congress, where competing sectors of the telecommunications industry were heard and their interests and the public interest were carefully balanced, the 1996 Act emerged as a bill that no one saw as perfect, but most saw as a step forward.  Importantly, the Act offered the prospect of removing oversight of telecommunications markets from the courts (which have acted as de facto regulators under the infamous "Modified Final Judgment" breaking up AT&T) and placing it back in the hands of the marketplace, the states and -- to a limited extent -- Federal regulators.
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has had the opposite effect.  By attempting to use the Act as the basis for a Federal power grab, the Commission ensured a court challenge.  That challenge came not just from aggrieved parties (i.e., local telephone companies) who found the Commission's pricing rules unfair, but also from states who saw the order as an infringement on their authority.
<p>
In granting a stay of the FCC's order, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear its view that the Commission's order was more likely to harm competition than encourage it.  "Before the FCC published its regulations," the court found, the parties were "working together to implement the local competition provisions of the Act. The Act's system of private negotiation backed by state-run arbitration was operating without input from the FCC."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#3">3</A></sup>  The Commission's order, said the court, would "establish a price ceiling," which "inevitably confines and restricts the give and take of free negotiations and arbitrations."  As a result of the order, the court continued, "the negotiations preferred by Congress are already breaking down due to the competitors' desire to hold out for the FCC's proxy rates" (i.e., the price ceilings set in the FCC's order).
<p>
The court was also clear in suggesting that the Commission overstepped its bounds. "[W]e are skeptical," it stated, "that the FCC's roundabout construction of the statute could override what, at first blush, appears to be a rather clear and direct indication . . . that the state commissions should establish prices."  As a result, the court concluded, "the petitioners have demonstrated that they will likely succeed on the merits of their appeals."
<p>
Still, no one can be sure how the court -- which will not issue a final decision until at least next Spring -- will ultimately rule.  Thus, the process of creating competition in local telephone markets is effectively on hold.  Such legal wrangling, which may drag on for years, will delay the implementation of the law, denying to consumers the benefits of competition in the local telephone market  -- including access to low-cost ISDN and other advanced services needed for growth of the Internet.   
<p>
<CENTER><B>What Next?  Implementing Universal Service</B></CENTER>
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has implications well beyond the question of local competition.  In particular, it creates a dangerous precedent as the FCC prepares to implement the universal service provisions of the 1996 Act.
<P>
By November 8, the Federal-State Joint Board created by the Telecommunications Act will make a recommendation to the FCC on implementing the universal service provisions.  The Joint Board is almost exclusively composed of regulators, and it thus will not be surprising if they recommend regulation as the best method of implementation.  If the interconnect rule really does signal the FCC's continued love affair with detailed, excessive regulation, the result could well be yet another attempt to expand Federal authority.  The intent of the Telecommunications Act could, in other words, once again be turned on its head.
<P>
The Joint Board and the FCC should keep in mind a number of principles regarding universal service, including:
<P>
While people may have a "right" to dial-tone service to call the police or paramedics, no-one has a "right for that dial tone to be delivered over wires."  In some cases cellular phone service may be less expensive than wire.  If anything is to be mandated, it should be the service offered, not the technology by which it is accomplished.
<P>
Federal mandates, if any, should be minimal and limited to lifeline telephone service.  Provision of other telecommunications services (for example, voicemail or Internet access) should not be mandated from Washington but left to state officials to order and purchase.
<P>
Federally mandated universal service should be paid for by the Federal government; such subsidies should be raised in a competitively neutral manner and be obvious to those from whom they are collected.  States should be responsible for paying for any supplemental state mandates.  The FCC should set guidelines to ensure that any state subsidies are raised in a competitively neutral manner and are explicit to those from whom they are collected.
<P>
The essentially local nature of universal service – as ordered by Congress and demanded in practice – reinforces many of the arguments advanced by Congress and the Courts on interconnection.  The costs of specific universal service programs are impacted, in large part, by the progress of competition in specific local markets and the pricing of interconnection agreements.  The devolution of Federal authority over interconnection agreements therefore implies the devolution of universal service mandates.  On the other hand, Federal usurpation of state authority on interconnection issues makes state leadership on universal service questions nearly impossible.
<P>
Wherever possible, the FCC should rely on the market, not regulation, to most effectively implement universal service policies.  For instance, competitive bidding (similar to FCC-auctioned licenses for personal communications systems) could be used to control the cost of subsidies in high-cost areas.  Auctions to provide service among potential competitors would reveal the minimum subsidy required for them to provide service.  This would remove the arbitrariness and controversy associated with cost estimation by government mandate.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Moving Ahead:  Accountability to Congress</B></CENTER>
<P>
The telecommuncations marketplace is not yet fully competitive.  Congress recognized the need for continuing, limited oversight by the FCC to manage the transition.  But massive, detailed regulation is not the way to achieve competition.  Instead, in implementing the Telecommunications Act, the FCC should concentrate its efforts on a few overarching issues and articulate a limited number of boundary-setting guidelines.  The practical, prudent approach is for the FCC to defer largely to the states, while preserving the FCC's ability to address significant problems on review.
<P>
If the FCC fails to reaffirm both the deregulatory intent and the devolutionary spirit embraced by the Telecommunications Act, the prospects for rapid progress toward a competitive telecommunications marketplace will be dramatically reduced, and Congress' central intent in passing the Act will be frustrated.   The question for Congress will then be clear:  Will it allow a regulatory agency to flaunt Congressional will, or will it act to ensure that the goal of a competitive marketplace is achieved?<p><BR>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>In an attempt to keep Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" in perspective, The Progress & Freedom Foundation convened its Aspen Summit '96:  Cyberspace and the American Dream Conference August 4-6.
More than 150 people gathered in Aspen, Colorado, to explore the promise and peril of the Digital Revolution.  "We want to remind ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  Great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay – even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world," said Foundation President Jeffrey A. Eisenach.
<P>
<a name="first">

<BR>
<BR>
<H4>First Panel</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/society.gif" ALIGN="left">
<DD>David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report moderated a panel discussion on "Shaping American Society for the Digital Age" that featured Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, David Gelernter of Yale University and Heather Higgins of PFF.
<DD>Dyson described how in the digital world people may need to distinguish between public and private persons.  A private person, using encryption technology as a defense mechanism to protect themselves, is ensured of confidentiality in one-to-one communications like e-mail.  However, when one posts information on the Internet for all to see, offers something to sell, or asks for credit to pay bills, that part of their activity becomes public and will require more disclosure and verification.
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist and author of 1939:  The Lost World of the Fair, said that America's biggest problems, our failing education system and struggling families, are things computers cannot deal with.  Basically, Gelernter said, we use computers for word processing, data manipulation, information storage and communication.  However, he asked, "compared to Americans in 1939, are we better writers?  More informed?  Better educated?  Richer communicators?"
After the discussion, Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) offered "a practical view" on the how the digital revolution is affecting American society.  "When I walk into a labor hall and a union member tells me that he just lost his manufacturing job, what am I supposed to say? 'Great, now you can go get a knowledge job.'"
<P>
<a name="second">
<BR>
<H4>Second Panel</H4>
<P>
<DD>A second panel discussion at the Summit, moderated by Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute, featured author George Gilder, Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, Rich Karlgaard of Forbes ASAP and Jay Keyworth of PFF.  Les Vadasz of Intel offered the "practical view" of the technologies creating the new economy.
<DD>After a series of working group sessions on Education, Regulatory Convergence, Intellectual Property, and Privacy and Censorship, the Summit concluded with a debate on if the "Growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of Progress."
<P>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<a name="toffler">
<BR>
<H4>Toffler Explores Political Flexibility</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>"What do Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich have in common?" asked author Alvin Toffler as he opened PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  "They both promised revolutionary change – Hillary in health care and Newt more broadly – and both were slapped down," he concluded.
<DD>Toffler's speech, titled "Future Shock in the Present Tense," described how Americans feel battered by the very acceleration of the Information Revolution.  "They want a chance to slow down and <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/toffle.gif" ALIGN="left">catch their breath.  People, including companies, are disoriented and grasp after anything" that seems to offer reassurance.
<DD>The American political system, its very structure, Toffler said, is ultra stable and resists change.  "It punishes change makers like Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich."  Toffler explored whether Americans want a political system that is more flexible and thus might better adjust to the changes in society being engendered by the Information Revolution.  With too many alienated people, Toffler wondered if more flexibility in America's political structure might be needed to avoid violence.
<DD>Toffler also spoke about the importance of no longer discussing "the future of the economy" because it implies a continuation of the industrial age, but instead to focus on "the economy of the future," which will compel a redefinition of basic economic fundamentals.
<DD>In conclusion, Toffler said that the Information Age is shattering existing cultures around the world, and while we can "remain American, we cannot remain Americans of the past but will be Americans of the future."

<BR>
<DD>Representative Rick White (R-WA), co-chair of the bi-cameral and bi-partisan <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/bradley.gif" ALT="Rep. Rick White and Sen. Bill Bradley at Aspen Summit '96"  ALIGN="right">Congressional Internet Caucus, addressed the Chairman's Dinner at PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  White urged the high-tech audience to learn how to effectively deal with Congress.  Until recently, the computer industry did not need to interact much with Washington, White said, but with their success has come increased government involvement in the industry.

<a name="pull">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>It's Time to Pull the Plug on Federal Power</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Declaring that federally owned power facilities created during the New Deal have accomplished their mission, PFF released a white paper urging their privatization.  The <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/1.gif" ALT="Rep. John Shadegg"  ALIGN=right>paper, co-authored by Representative John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Foundation Senior Fellow Michael Block, proposes a privatization method modeled on Czech experience, where consumers receive a portion of the money from privatization.
<DD>Power Marketing Administrations (PMA's) were designed to provide a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas; today, many of the once underdeveloped areas are affluent.   "PMAs' assets are of significant value to the private electric energy industry and, if sold by the government, would increase operating efficiency, eliminate market distortions, advance competition in electricity markets, and generate significant revenue for federal deficit reduction," argues the paper.
<DD>The paper – Lights Out on Federal Power:  Privatization for the   21st Century – outlines how the federal government should sell three PMA's, generating nearly $4.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit. 
<P>
<a name="telecom">
<P>
<H4>PFF Releases Telecom Book, The Innovation Age</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Peter K. Pitsch, PFF Adjunct Fellow and former Chief of Staff and Research Director at the FCC, authored the newly released Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution.
<DD>Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic, technological and social change that Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  Economic growth in this realm, argues Pitsch, depends on constant innovation and competition; therefore, government efforts to regulate these new technologies should adapt to reflect this new paradigm.
<DD>"Today's complexity and change make Hayek's 'spontaneous order' and Schumpeter's 'creative destruction' more compelling than ever before.  Peter Pitsch combines these concepts in a new economics of innovation that provides an illuminating view of telecom – both how to understand it and why market forces will regulate it best," says author George Gilder about The Innovation Age.
<P>
<a name="clean">
<P>
<H4>For Cleaner Air,  PFF Says Think Globally, Act Locally</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>A new PFF white paper urges the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.
<DD>"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas. 
<DD>"Alternative fuel – or non petroleum-based – vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions' strategies for meeting clean air goals," says the paper.

<H4>Fortson Joins District Council</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Senior Fellow Jane Fortson, director of PFF's Social and Cultural Studies, continues her involvement in urban issues and the District of Columbia.  She recently joined other District leaders as a founding board member of the DC Agenda Support Corporation, an organization modeled after the highly successful Fund for the City of New York.  Additionally, she is participating in an advisory group examining revenue issues for the District, sponsored by the Brookings Institution.

<h2>The Unveiling of the Innovation Age </h2>
</center>

On behalf of Hudson Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation, I am pleased to invite you to a special briefing on Wednesday, September 11 to unveil Hudson's latest book,<i> The Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution</i>.  The book's author is Hudson and PFF adjunct fellow Peter Pitsch, former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications Commission.<p>


Mr. Pitsch will provide opening remarks, and we have asked <b>Congressman Bob Walker</b> (R-PA) to do the same.  Serving as panel discussants will be <b>William E. Cohen</b>, Deputy Director, Policy Planning, for the Federal Trade Commission and <b> Blair Levin</b>, Chief of Staff for Chairman Reed Hundt of the Federal Communications Commission.  In discussing Mr. Pitsch's new book, they will attempt to answer the following questions:<p>
<ul> 
<li>Is the "Innovation Age" real?
<li>Does it require developing a new political economy of innovation?
<li>Has it strengthened the comparative advantage of marketplace solutions vis-à-vis regulation?
<li>Are the book's proposed reforms to telecommunications regulation desirable?
</ul>
	Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic and technological change which Mr. Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  In the book, he describes how the resulting complexity and potential for explosive growth have increased the cost of regulatory distortions, especially in the telecommunications market.  Peter Passell of <i>The New York Times</i> calls <i>The Innovation Age </I>  "painless introduction to the way economists are now rethinking regulation."<p>

	<i>This special briefing will be held from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 11, in Room 106 of Dirksen Senate Office Building.</i>  If you would like additional information, please call Mary Brown, Hudson's Director of Special Events, at 317-549-4150.  We hope you will be able to stop by.<p>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Advances in technology are perhaps the single
most important ingredient of further progress in providing a cleaner
environment for America and the world.  New clean-up technologies,
more efficient production processes - and simply the transition
from a smokestack-laden industrial economy to a digital economy
- provide the opportunity for today's Americans to live in a dramatically
cleaner world than the one their parents left them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Unhappily, current environmental policies often
lock obsolete technologies in place, or fail to provide appropriate
incentives for the development and adoption of new technologies
that are both cleaner and less costly than those currently in
use.  Even where our current policies work to encourage the adoption
of new technologies, they do so in ways that are often ineffective,
typically through the use of top-down, command-and-control mandates.
<p> 
Current policies also fail, in many cases, to recognize that
while our commitment to a cleaner environment is national in scope,
the problem is often local or regional in nature - and hence not
easily addressed through national, one-size-fits-all standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America's current policies with respect to
air pollution are a case in point.  Since the 1970s, we achieved
significant progress in reducing emissions, but never enough to
meet clean air standards nationwide.  In response, the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments set different rules for the most polluted regions
and called for the development and deployment of new technologies
- including alternative fuel (nonpetroleum-based) vehicles (AFVs).
Yet in implementing a complex patchwork of programs to promote
AFVs, the Executive Branch is utilizing top-down mandates that
attempt to impose a uniform regime on an environmental problem
that varies dramatically by region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The clean air benefits of AFVs vary widely
by region for two reasons.  First, the types of air pollution
AFVs address are limited mainly to 22 cities, the state of California
and a 12-state region in the Northeast.  Second, the best way
of addressing these pollution problems also varies - in some cases,
AFVs may be the better approach; in other cases, different options
will be more effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the same time, the national security benefits
of AFVs (i.e., the reduction in American dependence on imported
petroleum) know no regional boundaries and hence call for a national
approach to encourage AFVs.  Achieving national promotion of AFVs
while maintaining regional flexibility in their use to reduce
air pollution is a complex challenge.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among different alternative fuel technologies
being developed, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural
gas offer the best prospects for AFV expansion.  And while the
infrastructure problem associated with refueling and delivery
of alternative fuels is a challenge, the hurdles for serving important
markets have been reduced significantly in recent years.  In fact,
in some important niche markets, conversion to alternative fuels
is justified on differences in fuel costs alone.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The current government approach to providing
incentives for AFV use is neither efficient nor effective.  For
example, our examination of current policies shows that:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The peculiar atmospheric traits of different
urban areas are not recognized by federal standards designed to
reduce urban smog.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Efforts by the Department of Energy to
encourage AFV use and federal mandates for the expansion of AFVs
in the federal fleet are not coordinated with EPA's efforts to
improve air quality in metropolitan regions.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel tax policies are not well
geared to provide larger incentives for cleaner-burning fuels.
(State fuel tax incentives are more closely tied to emission characteristics.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The mandated purchase of AFVs by operators
of public and private fleets for the purpose of providing national
security benefits is not accompanied by financial incentives for
covering incremental costs.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles,
which offer bright prospects for AFV use, are not covered by federal
statutes designed to encourage AFV use.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America needs a new, more effective and efficient
approach to promoting AFVs.  Among its main features should be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A program of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that recognize the peculiar environmental challenges of
U.S. cities and regions.  These newly created EIAs should be given
complete flexibility in choosing the means for meeting baseline
environmental standards and should serve as coordinating units
for federal efforts to expand AFV use.   </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel taxes that no longer favor
or discriminate against alternative fuels used in the search for
cleaner air.  Instead, tax policy should be designed to provide
incentives for the use of cleaner fuels that address emission
problems reaching far beyond the limits of cities and multi-state
regions.  States and regions should be encouraged to design fuel
taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels
in their areas.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore,</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal funds to cover the full incremental
cost of AFVs should accompany federal mandates that require nonfederal
fleet AFV purchases.  Based on past legislative goals considered
by Congress, funding for light AFVs could amount to as much as
$326 million annually.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a variety of existing tax subsidy
and expenditure programs that could be redeployed to at least
partly offset this cost.</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Because AFVs both pollute less and reduce
American reliance on imported petroleum, incentives for AFV use
are a lower-cost way to improve automobile fuel efficiency than
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> By removing barriers to expanded AFV use and
deployment of other improved technologies, implementation of these
proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and
national energy security goals.  This plan would expand AFV use
and concentrate environmental benefits in the most appropriate
geographical areas.  Among other benefits of such a program would
be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Multiple Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that will provide a national laboratory for discovering
lower cost institutions for improving all dimensions of environmental
quality.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The more logical expansion of AFV infrastructure
due to the creative and expanded use of EIAs and federally provided
funds to assist with the expansion of the AFV fleet.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Minimized costs in producing cleaner air
through the encouragement of tradeoffs between AFVs and other
approaches for reducing air pollution.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Improved technological innovation through
the adoption of new technology.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is no magic bullet or one best approach
for reducing air pollution in the United States.  A successful
policy for the 21st century will rely on a multitude of solutions
that emerge from those closest to the problem.  AFVs are a proven
technology that offer meaningful environmental benefits.  With
appropriate incentives and flexible institutions for accomplishing
environmental goals, AFVs can become an even more important part
of the environmental arsenal.</FONT>

<h2>Bradley, White to Attend Aspen Summit ‘96</h2>

Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be among the participants at the Aspen Summit this August 5-6, The Progress & Freedom Foundation announced today.  The Summit will explore whether America's future in the digital age will be one of progress or decay.
<p>
White, who is chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Bradley, who recently completed a tour promoting his new book <b>Time Present, Time Past</b>, will be among the more than 30 participants at the Summit.  Also attending will be author Alvin Toffler, PBS commentator David Gergen, ACLU president Nadine Strossen, author George Gilder, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and author David Gelernter.
<p>
"A recurring theme in this election year is the insecurity Americans feel about their future," said Foundation president Jeffrey A. Eisenach.  "The Summit will examine how America can best cope with the transition to a new society – how to make the transition less painful and more productive for all Americans."
<p>
The Summit, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Aspen, Colo., will also feature a debate on whether the growth of the Internet is a "Leading Cultural Indicator of Progress." Participants will include Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, authors of "Smash the Internet" (<i>Weekly Standard</i>, Oct. 30, 1995), G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, former Science Advisor to President Reagan, and Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings.
<p>
Four working groups at the Summit will explore what government policies should be pursued to ensure continued progress toward a better future in the digital age.  Former FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick will highlight a session on regulatory convergence and Shira Perlmutter, Associate Register for International Affairs and Policy at the Copyright Office, will highlight a session on intellectual property.

<h2>Administration Undermines Information Age National Security</h2>

The Clinton Administration's efforts to control the spread of "encryption" tools that scramble digital communications is putting at risk America's lead in the global communications race and threatening the U.S.'s future ability to protect itself, asserts a report issued today by The Progress & Freedom Foundation.<p>

	Encryption tools are key to the development of on-line banking, protecting privacy in an age when more and more information is stored on computers, and ensuring the authenticity of electronic messages. Fearing that terrorists and drug smugglers will encrypt their communications and thus foil American intelligence's electronic "eavesdropping" capabilities, the Administration is supporting continued controls on the export of encryption software.<p>

	Yet the PFF report, co-authored by G.A. Keyworth, chairman of the Foundation and former Science Advisor to President Reagan, found that "no matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption to fill the void left by American abdication of the market."<p>

	The report warned that government attempts to control encryption tools will destroy America's commercial and technological lead in the field.  This will eventually deny America - including the intelligence community itself - the latest encryption tools, because they will no longer be developed in the United States.<p>

In addition, the report continued, the Administration's policies jeopardize America's continued lead in the communications race and thus diminish the rewards of economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities Americans would otherwise have enjoyed.<p>

<h2>THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION, ENCRYPTION AND
TRUE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G. A. Keyworth, II, and David E. Colton, Esq.
<a href="encry-foot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
 Americans take it for granted that when they a send package via first class
mail its contents are protected.  We do not worry that someone will open our
envelopes and take our checking or credit card account numbers, read our
personal letters, or steal our business ideas.
<P>
Yet our privacy could be threatened as we move to a digital economy, where
more and more information is shared electronically – over the Internet, via
fax machines or on wireless phones.  Right now, the Clinton Administration is
proposing to restrict Americans’ ability to use "encryption" tools that
scramble digital communications so that they cannot be read by anyone other
than the intended receiver.  Today, basic encryption technology is utilized
every time you punch in your ATM code or use a password to protect files on
your computer.   But better encryption tools are needed to protect the assets
of on-line banking customers, the rights of musicians selling their songs in
Cyberspace or the trade secrets of American companies e-mailing documents to
their overseas branches.
<P>
America currently leads the world in the development of computer software –
including encryption.  Indeed, our current position as the undisputed leader
of the digital age derives from our overwhelming success at winning the
computer race. Start-ups that were born in our garages and hobby clubs less
than twenty years ago have created a whole new economy, the $1.5 trillion
digital industry.  As a result, the nexus of technological innovation and
wealth creation for this new economy is in Silicon Valley, not Tokyo, Paris
or Bonn.  
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>The Clinton Administration’s attempt to control encryption technology is one
of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory thinking threatens
America’s ability to compete and win in the digital era.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
Yet a new contest is already underway: the race to generate wealth by
connecting computers into a global, digital communications system.  The rules
for this competition are just now being set, and the situation is very
different from the computer race.  The government largely refrained from
regulating the computer industry (no one told Apple or Microsoft or Intel
what markets they could enter or what products they could sell).  In the
communications race, America's regulatory apparatus (i.e., the FCC) – created
in the 1930s, before television networks, cellular phones or e-mail – is a
huge handicap.   America’s competitive lead in the communications race could
be squandered by the retarding forces of excessive regulation, with immense
consequences:  lost technological leadership, fewer jobs and lower standards
of living.
</td></tr></table>

<P>
While the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an important first step toward
removing roadblocks in the creation of a digital communications network, much
work remains if America is to maintain its international lead.  Our most
formidable opponent is not foreign competition, but a misguided, overzealous
Federal government.  The Administration’s attempt to control encryption
technology is one of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory
thinking threatens America’s ability to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Encryption:  Protecting Your Valuables from Theft</b>
<br>
The encryption concepts at issue are not complicated.  In essence, encryption
technology empowers people to protect their digital property from
unauthorized use.  Whether you are sending an e-mail to a friend, your doctor
is faxing your medical records to the insurance company, you are ordering a
take-out dinner over you wireless phone (and using your credit card number to
pay in advance), or giving the plans for your latest product to your business
partner on a floppy disc, encryption tools allow you to "scramble" your
message.  Only the intended recipient – who holds a "key" – can access the
information.
<P>
Encryption technology is based on strings of numbers (the "key").  The more
numbers in the key, the "stronger" the encryption.  For instance, the
standard ATM code of four numbers would be harder to crack if it were ten
numbers.  The possible variations increase dramatically each time a number is
added to a key, and thus more computing power is required to figure out all
the possible combinations.
<P>
There are two types of encryption.  The first is known as single key, in
which the key to code and decode a transmission is the same. 	The second
encryption system, known as the public key approach, uses two sets of keys.
 One key is publicly revealed, the other is known only to the user.  The keys
are linked in such a manner that information encrypted by the public key can
only be deciphered by the corresponding private key.  Public key techniques
are much more secure than single key approaches.  Such programs are
available, world-wide and generally free, through the Internet.  It is these
public key programs that are the real focus of the Administration’s attempt
to restrict encryption tools.
<P>
The Administration seeks to retard development of encryption technologies by
allowing export only of mass market software with "weak" encryption standards
using 40-bit keys.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>1</sup></a>   
Similar restrictions apply to hardware and computer
systems.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
   The stated goal is to slow development of encryption technologies
abroad, so that the intelligence community (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.) will have
easier access to communications.
<P><br>
<b>Are Encryption Controls Part
of the American Spirit?</b>
<br>
<table>
<tr width=80>

<td>
The Administration invokes "national security" concerns to justify export
control regulations that cripple development of sophisticated U.S. encryption
technologies.  The government claims that it must have the ability to monitor
communications in the digital age in order to protect Americans from
terrorists, drug smugglers and other nefarious types. To achieve this, the
Administration argues, we must control the terms and conditions by which
individual Americans can use sophisticated encryption technology both <i>at home
</i>and abroad.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>3</sup></a>   
Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community
never seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the
lives of American citizens.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community never

American citizens.</h3><hr width=75>
</td>
</tr></table> 
<P>
How we handle this issue has profound implications for American society in
the digital age.   The encryption debate raises serious Constitutional
questions.  What is the role of the Fourth Amendment, which reserves to the
people the right "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects"?
 What constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in Cyberspace?  What
rights to privacy can citizens expect in a digital era?  These are major,
fundamental questions that the American people must resolve.  No one yet has
the answers.  Yet the Administration’s encryption proposals, if enacted,
would allow what are little more than bureaucratic interests in the national
security community to dictate the answers.
<P>
The outcome of the encryption debate will also shape the foundation for U.S.
economic prosperity in the digital age.  A society of connected computing and
networking requires that all individuals have confidence that their
communications are secure and that messages and data are authentic, not
forgeries.  Encryption is the means to make that possible.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>The Administration’s attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine America’s security in the digital
age.</h3>
<hr width=75></td>
<td>
But encryption technology is not just about privacy and secure
communications.  It is also about protecting intellectual property.  For
instance, with innovative encryption systems, the makers of <i>Jurassic Park II
</i>(for example) would be able to encrypt a digital signal in the movie that
prevents bootlegged copies of it being made and sold on the black market.
 Before artists, entrepreneurs or Fortune 500 companies will invest their
resources in a new digital product, they will demand assurances that it be
secure from theft.
</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
The best means of protection is self-defense.  American companies should be
allowed to develop and use encryption tools to protect their intellectual
property and trade secrets before turning to government for assistance.  In
that sense, encryption can be thought of as the "barbed wire" of the digital
age, allowing owners of intellectual property to be their own first lines of
defense against theft and encroachment, just as barbed wire allowed farmers
on America's prairie to protect themselves against encroachment by wayward
cattle.  Barbed wire was not an <i>alternative</i> to government enforcement of
property rights, but it allowed government to serve as a <i>backstop</i> rather than
as the first line of defense.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>4</sup></a>  
<p><br>
<b>Encryption Obsolescence
at Hyper Speed</b>
<P>
To maintain their competitive lead in the digitally connected economy,
American companies are continually creating encryption technologies.  Such
rapid innovation makes the national security and  intelligence communities’
goals of controlling this technology illusory.  Governments can no longer
dictate the pace and scope of technological innovation.
<P>
The core concept of the computer revolution, Moore’s Law, states that the
power of a microprocessor doubles approximately every 18 months while its
costs stay the same.  Thus, in 1984, a desktop computer could execute 2
million instructions per second, but by 1994, the same machine was capable of
256 million instructions per second.  By 1998, a desktop microprocessor will
run more than 2 <i>billion </i> instructions per second.  Such incredible
advancement in computer power guarantees that the intelligence community will
fail to control encryption technology.
<P>
Moore’s Law makes the focus on encryption key length irrelevant.  So-called
strong encryption is only "strong" relative to available computing power to
crack the string of numbers that comprise the key.  As computing power
doubles every 18 months, no encryption scheme will remain strong for long;
adding numbers to the key merely forestalls the inevitable. Encryption will
be rendered quickly weak without constant innovation .
<P>
Yet the Administration proposes to enshrine in law a mandated encryption
standard based on today’s computing power – a standard that would soon be
rendered obsolete by advances in microprocessor speed.  This is not a
theoretical prediction; it is hard fact.  Indeed, the government’s preferred
40-bit key has already been compromised – in this case by two French graduate
students using their school’s computer to hack Netscape.  Cheap and
affordable chips customized to break encryption keys are readily available.
 For example, one "field programmable gate arrays" chip, costing as little as
$20, can crack the 40-bit key in about five hours.  But many such chips can
be used together, in parallel, to break a 40-bit key in about 24 <i>seconds</i>.
 Clearly, government encryption "standards" would soon be overtaken by
technology, leaving Americans handcuffed in their ability to compete with
foreigners.
<P><br>

<b>The True Threat to National Security: Encryption Controls,
Not Encryption Technology</b>
<p>
The Administration’s attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine America’s security in the digital
age.  Export controls already are threatening to drive America’s software
industry off-shore.  Allowed to continue, this phenonemon eventually will
deny America -- <i>including the intelligence community itself</i> -- the latest in
encryption technology.
<P>
Among the many problems with export controls on encryption technology, first
and foremost is the fact that they are unworkable.  In the past, it was
possible to contain specific technologies (e.g. metallurgical science applied
to design of submarines or "stealth" airplanes) through export controls.
 These technologies focus on specific capabilities and require significant
infrastructure to be of use.  But digital technology can be taken out of the
country almost effortlessly by transmitting it over the Internet.  And, of
course, nothing can prevent foreigners from coming to America, legally
purchasing encryption technology (at stores such as Wal-Mart) and then
(illegally) taking it home with them. Hackers try to demonstrate the
absurdity of export controls by noting that it may be considered illegal to
wear a t-shirt, when leaving the United States, that has printed on it the
code for an encryption key (the t-shirt would be considered a munition).
<P>
It is also absurd to assume that, just because American encryption technology
is not legally for sale on the international market, that foreign
governments, companies and criminals will not be able to encrypt their
communications and intellectual property.   Unlike, say, nuclear weapons,
which require amounts of difficult-to-obtain materials to build, computer
software design has virtually no "barriers to entry."  Joseph Schumpeter’s
description of the capitalist firm truly applies here:  "Most new firms are
founded with an idea and definite purpose.  The life goes out of them when
that idea or purpose has been fulfilled or has become obsolete or even if,
without having become obsolete, it has ceased to be new."   This is
particularly apt for encryption technologies.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>5</sup></a> 
<P>
<table>
<tr width =80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>Preventing America’s leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td>
No matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a
bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption
to fill the void left by American abdication of the market.  A recent survey
of products employing cryptography both within and outside the United States
confirms the lack of barriers to entry in encryption technology.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>6</sup></a>    Companies
from more than 28 countries sell almost 500 encryption products.  If American
leadership stumbles, others are ready and eager to assume the mantle.
</td></tr></table>
  Today, the intelligence community is worried about controlling the latest
encryption technology developed in the United States.  With export controls
in place, Americans may find in just a few short years that the true national
security problem is trying to obtain the latest encryption software developed
<i>outside</i> the United States.
<P>
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies – perhaps to present Congress
a <i>fait accompli</i> – have urged foreign governments to adopt approaches to
regulating encryption similar to those in America.   But even the adoption by
other governments of proscriptive encryption regulations would not alter our
analysis.  One individual, such as the legendary Phil Zimmerman, can create
an encryption system as widely acclaimed as his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) in
just five months in his cabin in Colorado.  That program is now available
world-wide through the Internet.  Digital technology and the lack of barriers
to entry mean that individuals  from almost anywhere can circumvent
government-imposed limitations – regardless how many governments impose them.
<P>
Export controls also hurt America’s high-tech industry.   Many law abiding
international customers want to protect their communications and intellectual
property for the same reasons as Americans, and, as noted above, they will
develop the technology to do so themselves if they cannot purchase it from
the United States.  The global demand for secure computing continues to grow
with the spread of connected computing.  After all, the international market
for Internet connectivity is 20 times what it is in the United States.  
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>7</sup></a>  In
this burgeoning market, the highest demand over the next decade will be for
goods and services that incorporate the assurance of confidentiality only
encryption can provide.
<P>
Preventing America’s leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race. Already, 60 percent of American workers
are knowledge workers, and eight of ten new jobs are in information intensive
sectors of the economy.  More Americans make computers than cars.  More
Americans make semiconductors than build construction equipment, and people
processing data outnumber those refining petroleum.  Should American firms be
foreclosed from competing to win in this market, the immediate effect may be
a 30 percent loss in market share for computer systems alone.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>8</sup></a>     The impact
on the whole U.S. software industry would be equally devastating and
threatens the commanding 75 percent market share for mass market software
enjoyed by American companies today. <a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>9</sup></a> 
   This is merely a short-term extrapolation.  The long-term effects could be even 
more pernicious: lost technological leadership is rarely recovered.
<P>
Yet probably the greatest threat to Americans’ national security from the
encryption controls being proposed by the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies would be the loss of freedom on the part of U.S. citizens.  Seeking
to retain some control over public key encryption, the most recent
Administration proposal seeks to have Americans register their personal keys
with a government-approved third party.  This is analogous to the government
asking all Americans to place a copy of their safe deposit box keys with a
government-approved third party.  By coercing so-called "voluntary"
cooperation, the intelligence community asks that every American leave
themselves exposed before the State in the digital age.
<p>
Nothing could be more perverse than to turn the potential of the digital era
to empower individuals into a more invasive means of government surveillance
and control.  We believe that the Administration’s positions will not
withstand Constitutional challenge.  The question to ask is why, in light of
all we've learned as America's competitiveness has resurged in this new
digital economy, should we waste our time and energy pursuing something that,
in a Jeffersonian sense, is so patently un-American and which, in the
practical sense of Moore's Law, is simply wrong.  As Americans hesitate, the
window of opportunity for continuing our leadership of the computer
revolution is rapidly closing.  
<P><br>
<b>The Threat To American Intelligence and Law Enforcement Is Overstated</b>
<p>
Together with law enforcement agencies, America’s intelligence community
plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation.  Moreover, in many instances
the resources they can bring to bear to battle crime are without peer.   The
technical capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community, for example, are
the finest in the world.  The community has and will continue to have the
technical and human resources to meet its mission.
<P>
The National Security Agency (NSA) and its sister agencies have the capacity
to break current encryption systems, and there is little reason to believe
they will not have the capability to penetrate future designs.   Public
estimates of  the time the NSA requires to break 40- and 56-bit key codes are
conservative, for the agency has truly massive parallel processing power for
"brute force" attacks on a given code.  More importantly, NSA specialists are
world-class, and can often succeed in cracking an encryption system through
"number crunching."  They often understand the inner workings of a given
program or code and can exploit these vulnerabilities, greatly reducing the
burdens of decryption.  While in the short term encryption controls might
make the NSA’s task easier, in the long run, as we have noted above, we as a
nation would suffer greatly.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, the intelligence community can provide
time-urgent penetration of communications networks for collection and
counter-intelligence needs.  Cracking an encrypted digital e-mail may not be
as easy as wire tapping an analog telephone.  Nonetheless, the United States
currently has the technical capability needed for security in the digital
future.  To most effectively utilize these capabilities might require tasking
and prioritizing resources in a new way, something all bureaucracies,
including the intelligence and law enforcement agencies, naturally dislike
because it upsets the status quo.  But, ultimately, the intelligence
community relies on the technical innovation and leadership of the America’s
private sector to keep it at the forefront of developments.   Any decline in
U.S. leadership in the computer race, which controls on encryption technology
will lead to, will have repercussions on the NSA’s abilities as well. 
<P>
Domestic law enforcement can also pursue its public safety mission without
draconian invasions into the privacy of citizens through mandatory key escrow
systems.  Clear thinking without emotion is required.  Allegations that
encryption technology will result in future New York City World Trade
Tower-type terrorist incidents or bombings of Federal buildings are
irresponsible.  Encryption technologies, of course, had no connection at all
to either incident. (Indeed, it is worth recalling that the FBI’s own
informant tried to warn the Bureau – unsuccessfully – about the impending
attack in New York).  Furthermore, it is just as easy to plot a terrorist
attack through almost completely secure first class mail as it is via e-mail.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=150 hspace=5>
<td>
While there have been and certainly will be instances of law enforcement
agencies successfully averting a crime or catching criminals due to the
monitoring of communications, the FBI and other police agencies must adjust
the existing framework for traditional wireline intercepts to the digital
age.   To do so, they must admit one simple truth: organized crime and drug
cartels – or anyone seriously intending to violate the law – will attempt to
buy the best encryption technology available.  Preventing American industry
from developing it simply means the illegal enterprises will buy the
capability from Japan, Bombay or Taiwan.  They may even pay American software
writers to covertly develop code for them.   Regardless of the method,
criminals will obtain encryption technology.

digital age.</h3><hr width=75>
</td></tr></table>
<P>
The solution is thus not to "dumb down" the American economy and industry.
 Rather, law enforcement must become more digitally savvy.  Upon obtaining
court authorization for digital surveillance, law enforcement must have
access to sufficient resources in the intelligence community should
encryption issues arise.  If it is a question of sharing resources and
capabilities among national security agencies (who currently have among the
best encryption writing and cracking capabilities) and law enforcement
agencies, Congress can help this to occur by developing new coordination
mechanisms.  Long standing bureaucratic rivalries between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can (and should) be overcome.  If suitable cooperation
is not forthcoming, law enforcement could be permitted to develop its own
cryptographic capabilities.  That would be a small price to pay to enable
America to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Controlling our Future in
the Digital Age</b>
<p>
We are in the midst of a profound revolution made possible by the
microprocessor.  It is transforming our society more completely and faster
than did the printing press, the telephone or even the television.   By
winning the first round of the computer race, we reaped the rewards of
 economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities.  We can
win the race for connected computing as well.  This is the best means of
providing for national security, broadly defined. 
<P>
What is called for in encryption is no less than an end to government
sponsored encryption standards, except for its own use.  Export controls on
commercial digital technology, especially in the consumer realm, should be
terminated.  Moreover, the Federal government should be explicitly barred
from placing restrictions on the sale and use of encryption programs
domestically, and mandatory key escrows should be prohibited.  These steps
are necessary for two, reinforcing reasons:  The first is that such barriers
to our future wealth generating capacity are simply unaffordable;  the second
is that such interventions will not work anyway.  
<P>
In a more general sense, however, it is we citizens, not the intelligence
community, who should determine the nature of our Constitutional heritage in
the digital age.

<TITLE>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?  -- PFF</TITLE>

<h2>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?</h2>
<P>
<img src="bi.gif"><P>

We're always being asked what our logo represents, so we thought
we'd explain (but, believing in competition as we do, we thought
we'd offer a couple of alternatives -- each one has its own champions
internally).
<P>
<B>It's From the Story of Sisyphus</B>
<ul>
The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was king of Corinth, holds that
he saw the god Zeus carry off the beautiful maiden Aegina.  Sisyphus
then told Aegina's father what he had witnessed. Enraged with
Sisyphus, Zeus condemned him to Tartarus, where he was compelled
for eternity to roll to the top of a steep hill a stone that always
rolled down again.(1) The struggle for both progress and freedom
is this -- never-ending, difficult, sometimes torturous.  Absent
inspired action, progress is replaced by atrophy.
</ul>
<B>It's From the 1939 World's Fair</B>
<ul>
Dominating the landscape at the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940
were a white obelisk and globe -- the Trylon and Perisphere --
that came to symbolize the meaning of the fair. For a nation just
coming out of a depression, the fair presented its overall theme
-- The World of Tomorrow -- as a very bright one,  through ever
inventive technology, brilliance of industrial and architectural
design, comprehensive planning, scientific progress and the democratic
ideology.  The fair presented a compelling and cohesive vision
of the world that the New Dealers told us they would make -- a
world based in an industrial planning model that now needs replacing.(2)
</ul>
<B>It's From an Economist's Graph</B> 
<ul>
The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two ideas are different.  Things never
stand still but always move ahead.  Yet the world being the way
it is, things rarely stay constant as they move, but progress
or decay, as in the graph below.<br>
<img src="arrows.gif">
<br>
The nature of progress being what it is, you must have a vision
and sense of right and wrong to know where you should be heading.
 From your starting point you must set out to build a better world,
or else you accept decay.  Thus, you must always be pushing to
ensure progress.(3)<br>

Much of our recent work on telecom has been enhanced by the

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">PFF is working to describe what a Transformation of American Life
driven by the new technologies of the information revolution really
means.  How will it change our fundamental values and beliefs?
 Society's elemental relationships?   The organization and workings
of our economy?  And our political compact with ourselves [or
is it, after all, between us and the state]?
<P>
If we can describe what is to come, we can show what is to be
done.  In addition, policy change is taking place in Washington,
in state legislatures, indeed, in governments around the world,
as policymakers attempt to understand the consequences of the
move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on regulatory
policy.  PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications debate,
focusing on the next generation of deregulation.

<td valign="top" width="20%">The talk in Washington is all about the end of the old party system.
 Not FDR's grand coalition (already dead!), but the two parties
themselves, the party system itself, seems to be unraveling. 
Are rebel voters, renegade factions, and brash new parties just
perturbations on an historical continuum? Or is the Old Order
really tottering?  And if it goes, what rises to take its place?
<P>
From where does all this voter anger arise?  Why do they feel
so alienated from their government?  The current structure of
the Federal government - centralized, bureaucratic decision making
in Washington to solve the nation's problems - came to the fore
in the 1930s and has reigned supreme ever since.  Until today.
 What type of governmental structures are needed for the 21st
century?  Is it time to replace the industrial state?

Surgical Lasers!  Genetic Engineering!  Molecular Transports!
 Surgery in Cyberspace!  Civilization is poised to make major
strides in medicine and health.  These advances have the potential
to dramatically increase both life spans and the quality of life,
while at the same time reducing the cost of health care.
<P>
Yet America's enjoyment of these benefits is threatened because
every day the current system for approving new medical technology
stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths and
suffer senseless pain.   Why is that many of our drug and medical
device companies are able to offer products to patients in Europe
years before they ever receive FDA approval to do in the USA?
 How do we speed the approval process while ensuring safety? 
Who should pay for all this?  Is it time to replace the FDA?

are using right now is consuming power that costs you money on
your electricity bill every month - costs that have the potential
to be reduced significantly with sound reform.  Electric energy
is huge; the United States is home to nearly 1/3 of the installed
electric generating capacity in the world.
<P>
Why does the Federal government own some of it?  And why is it
regulated in a way to make a Soviet bureaucrat proud?  Should you - and
could you - choose the source of your power just like you choose
your long-distance company?  The Japanese are building tons of
it, the French have a flourishing industry in it, but in America
the nuclear energy industry is dying.<h4><a href="nrglink.html">Why?</a></h4>

America is undergoing a transformation as profound as the Industrial
Revolution.  Our work, leisure, education, warfare &#133; our
conceptions about society itself are all changing.  Revolution
is an over used word these days, but we are experiencing one.
Revolutions are messy; they often get violent, and unless we have
a sense of where we want to go we may end up in a place we don't
want to be.
<P>
Yet no one in the Imperial City wants to talk about Big Change.
 We are hampered by having lived most of our lives in a stable
political world where Revolution just didn't happened.  But it's
here, so now what?

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
"The views expressed here are solely those of the authors and do not
necessarily represent the views of the Board, Officers or Staff of The
Progress & Freedom Foundation."

<br>

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

<blockquote>
          The authors argue against progressivity on the ground
          that taxable income is a poor measure of economic
          status.  Thus high progressive tax rates fail to
          achieve their egalitarian purpose.  However, in the
          process significant economic disincentives and
          inefficiencies are introduced which reduce growth and
          fairness.  Consequently, a flat-rate may be a
          preferable alternative.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1093.html">Backgrounder #1093</a>, <i>How A Flat Tax Would Affect Charitable Contributions</i></b> by John S. Barry. (December 16, 1996)
<p>

Contrary to popular opinion, the data suggest that giving to charities probably would increase with passage of a flat tax with no charitable deduction. The reason: The flat tax increases economic growth, personal income, savings, and net wealth, all of which lead to higher levels of giving.

<p>
Lower taxes followed by sweeping tax reform is a recipe for renewal. This book should arm American taxpayers with the information they need to spread the word about the benefits of a pro-growth tax policy.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">Backgrounder #1091,</a> <i>The Case for Repealing the Estate Tax,</i></b> by William W. Beach (August 21, 1996)<p> 

   "Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception." In this careful analysis of the short and long-term effects of estate taxes in the United States, Beach demonstrates the negative impact of such taxes from both an economic and a philisophically liberal position.  Warning that the apparently minor significance of the tax makes it easy and dangerous to overlook, Beach sees its repeal as a source of a better economy, more jobs, and higher wages.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090.html">Backgrounder #1090,</a> <i>How to Measure the Revenue Impact of Changes in Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (August 9, 1996) <p>
One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in the 1996 election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  Using decades of empirical evidence, Mitchell explains why government officials should take such economic variables into account when determining the budgetary effects of tax reductions.

Economic evidence proves that when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Examining three decades--the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s--Mitchell shows how tax policy can affect the economy and the Treasury, and provides suggestions for changes to tax policies in the 1990s.

The study shows how the Clinton economic plan resulted in slower growth as compared with previous economic expansions.

Government taxation and spending have reached intrusive levels in our economy and personal lives. The best way to solve the problem, the panelists argue, is to enact a flat tax that reduces the tax burden on workers and businesses, while restricting Congress's ability to take money out of the economy. Additionally, by limiting government spending and enacting laws requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise taxes, Congress would go a long way toward alleviating the fiscal burden the federal government places on citizens.

</HEAD>
<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/7-10-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]</h5>




<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>
<td>

<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>

<li>Accountant for Al D'Amato

<img src="simp.gif" align="left">

<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>



<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a>]</h5>

<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>

[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-12-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]<p>


</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>

<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/dollar3.gif" align="left" alt="hundred dollar bill">


While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>


<img src= "/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/library2.gif" align="right" alt="generic library scene">


If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.


<p>Good luck with your internship search.  If you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:njg9b@virginia.edu">email </a> me.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly">Text Only</a> ]</h5>







<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are “despicable.”  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these “great defenders” of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a “draconian” cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments won’t change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nation’s leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<h2>The AFL-CIOs "Union Summer"</h2>
</center>



<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96/welcome.html.cgi/textonly"> Text Only</a> ]</h5>








<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "today’s profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions’ heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the union’s "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSC’s <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the ‘96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEA’s tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIO’s president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeney’s blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>What’s alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<title>Memorial Day Spotlight</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<h2><b><center>Memorial Day Spotlight</center></b></h2>
<br>
<p>On the last Monday of May, Americans celebrate Memorial Day, honoring 
those who have died for this great nation while serving in combat.  The holiday 
began in 1868, when <a href="http://suvcw.org/logan.htm">General Order No. 11</a> was promulgated by <a href="http://www.outfitters.com/illinois/history/civil/john_logan.html">General John Logan</a>, commanding that May 30th would be a day for "strewing with 
flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of 
their country."
<br>
<p>Although begun as an honor primarily for Union Soldiers who died in the 
Civil War, this holiday, initially called "Decoration Day," was recognized by both 
North and South on the last day of Monday by the end of World War I.  The 
holiday eventually spread to include the fallen of all wars, and became known 
with time as Memorial Day.
<br>
<p>Even though a certain contemporary president may only wish to invoke 
military status when threatened with a lawsuit, there are others in the nation's 
capitol-- both Democrats and Republicans-- who have served our nation in a 
more honorable way.  The story of <a href="http://aspin.asu.edu/~pctp/mccain/mccain.html">John McCain's</a> five years as a prisoner of war and <a href="http://www.dole96.com">Bob Dole's</a>  
wounding in a raid against the Germans in northern Italy in 1945 serve as 
inspiring reminders of the lengths we must go to, should our nation beckon.  
Other veterans of the U.S. wars of our include <a href="http://www.house.gov/samjohnson/welcome.html">Representative Sam Johnson of 
Texas</a>, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens">Senator Ted Stevens of 
Alaska</a>, and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~kerry">Senator Kerry of Nebraska</a>.
<br>
<p>In the words of General John Logan, "let us, then, at the time appointed, 
gather around their sacred remains and garland the passionless mounds above 
them with choicest flowers of springtime; let us raise above them the dear old 
flag they saved from dishonor... if other eyes should grow dull and other hands 
slack, and other hearts cold in solemn trust, ours shall keep it well as long as the 
light and warmth of life remains in us."
<br>
<p>Thanks to all United States veterans!

A growing number of state legislators are voicing their opposition to <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a>, known as the <b>CAREERS</b> bill, which would expand and make permanent the School-to-Work Act passed by Congress in 1994. <p>

In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Missouri Republican delegation, 
Missouri legislators said that <a href="http://www.house.gov/eeo/status_bills.html">H.R. 1617</a> "incorporates word-for-word many sections of Goals 2000, include the <b>removal of local control from education</b> and the <b>centralization of power to the federal government</b> including the need for approval from the Department of <a href="http://www.dol.gov">Labor</a> and <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Education</a> for a state's proposal to grant money. <p>

"The terms used in the acts are of concern as they refer to items such as a 'skills certificate' which children would be required to earn and which employers would be encouraged to require as a condition of employment.<p>

"Finally, a myraid of new agencies, department, and programs are created...and it appears that a <b>large, centralized, nationwide data collection system</b> will be put in place." <p>

<a href="/townhall/FRC/">The Family Research Council</a> has also expressed concern on behalf of thousands of families across the country. <p>

In a recent <i>Alert</i>, Family Research Council elaborated on the provisions it found unacceptable:
<ul>
<li><b>The inclusion of youth in a seamless system of workforce development</b>.  
The needs of youth are much different from those of an unemployed adult.  Vocational education should be a matter left to the local control of elected boards, not merged into a complex new workforce development infrastructure.
<p>
<li><b>The creation of a workforce development infrastructure</b>.  The CAREERS bill requires the creation of state and local workforce development baords that will oversee all aspects of the "seamless system" of workforce development.  These boards will be appointed, <i>not</i> elected.  
<p>
<li><b>The Labor Market Information System (LMIS)</b>. This system has the potential to collect data on every American employer, worker and student.  Proponents of the bill rationalize LMIS by claiming the need for jobseekers to be able to access information on job openings across the country.  Why should the government duplicate information already provided by trade associations, business journals, and classified ads everywhere?

<br><H2>Kickoff to Campaign '96: The Nomination Process Begins</CENTER></H2>

<br>
This week Town Hall presents a look at the upcoming caucuses and primaries that will play a central role in determining who will be the 1996 Republican Party presidential nominee. A front-runner will soon emerge with a tidal wave of support that should carry him all the way to the GOP convention in San Diego, and to the White House. Past experience has shown that success in these early events is critical to launching a successful bid for the nomination.<P>
For instance, no Republican candidate has has won the party's nomination in nearly a half-century without first winning the New Hampshire primary. The quick pace of the primary season is even quicker this year with the changes in the Louisianna caucus and the Delaware primary dates, and many of the pundits believe that the race will be over by mid March. The Town Hall spotlight shines some light on the small, yet pivotal caucuses and primaries of February.

<br><H2>The Balanced Budget: Will We Ever See It?</CENTER></H2>

Balancing the Budget is a priority of the conservative revolution that swept through Congress in 1994, but so far, the President has impeded the budget process with his vetos.  What could have been done by conservatives in just a few weeks, is now turning into a year long process.  Some pundits are even now predicting that Clinton won't make a deal and take the issue to the voters in November.<P>
Town Hall will keep up on the details and bring them to you as they happen in the Budget Spotlight. Check here often more the lastest news, polls, and opinion as the nation debates the balanced budget.

The Food and Drug Administration was created in 1906 to protect Americans from unsafe food and drugs, but over the years, burdensome FDA regulations have slowed the approval process for many breakthrough medical treatments.  This session, the Congress is beginning to address these concerns and FDA reform is beginning to take shape.  Follow the Spotlight this week as we look at what the FDA does and why it should be reformed.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<hr>
<br>
February is only a few months away and politicians are once again flocking to New Hampshire in hopes of capturing the all important first primary of the presidential race. Currently there are 9 GOP candidates in the race, all participating in the ideological labeling which takes place before the issues control the campaign.  With nine candidates, it is difficult to remember who they are and what they stand for.<p>
This spotlight summarizes the candidtaes in question and relays a portion of their ideology and stance on the political spectrum.  Biographies and speeches can be found as well as the current <i>Heritage Foundation Policy Review</i> article which relays arguments for each of the candidates. Links to all of the presidential HomePages are also available.<p>
As the sun sets on the presidential race, there will only be one man who will assume power.  Make sure you make an informed decsoin with your vote.  Start here for the information!<p>

Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<br>
	I had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, I couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	I hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

<title>Hot Issues -- Travelgate -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2>Hot issues<p>Travelgate</h2><br><p></center>
The following letter, from ACU Chairman David A. Keene, was delivered to the United States Senate on September 11, 1996.
<p>
Dear Senator:<p>
On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge you to oppose the Levin-Biden amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill during floor considerations today.<p>
The Levin-Biden amendment would strike the provision providing for financial restitution for Billy Dale, the former head of the White House Travel Office, on the grounds that the measure is a private relief bill.
<p>
But that is not the case.  A private relief bill is legislation that, among other things, names a specific individual who will receive a benefit.  The Treasury-Postal bill contains no such specific reference.  The provision in question merely notes that its purpose is to provide restitution for the wrongly-fired former employees of the White House Travel Office.<p>
What's really going on here is that Senate liberals are trying to get Bill Clinton off the hook.  If they succeed in striking this provision, given the crush of legislative business remaining to be done in the few short weeks before the planned adjournment, Mr. Dale will have to wait until the next Congress to have his legal bills -- now in excess of $500,000 -- paid.  That's just not right.<p>
It wasn't right for Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Dale in the first place.  It wasn't right for Mr. Dale to be accused and indicted.  It wasn't right for the White House to look over his FBI file seven months <i>after</i> they had fired him.  It wasn't right that Mr. Clinton -- even after a jury acquitted Mr. Dale on all counts in less than two hours, after a two-week trial -- continued to remind the public that Mr. Dale had once considered agreeing to a guilty plea.<p>
And it's not right that Senators Levin and Biden want to protect the president from having to sign this provision into law.<p>
Billy Dale was an innocent man, unjustly accused, who watched his world crumble around him -- all for the sake of political spoils.  His reputation was besmirched, his family humiliated, his integrity challenged.  You can't repair the emotional damage the Clinton White House has inflicted on this man and his family.  But you can help him get one step closer to being financially whole again.  Defeat Levin-Biden, and return to Billy Dale at the very least the money that was taken from him.<p>
Yours Sincerely,<p>
David A. Keene<br>
Chairman<p>

                    The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 27, 1996:             <P>                  Dear Representative: <P>       On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 1833, the partial birth abortion ban, when it comes to the floor today for a        vote.      <P>          As you know, this bill passed the House last November, and then passed the Senate with slight        modifications.  By passing the Senate version of the legislation today, you will bypass the needfor        a conference committee and send the bill directly to the president's desk.      <P>          One Senate amendment allows the procedure in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the        mother.  And another Senate amendment shifts the burden of proof to prosecutors to demonstrate        that the abortionist had other options available to save the life of the mother (whereas the original        House language had placed the burden of proof on the abortionist to demonstrate that he or she        had no other option).                We believe the Senate amendments are acceptable, and do not deviate from the basic thrust of the        bill:  to prohibit the grisly practice of beginning the delivery of a baby, only to stop when the        baby's head is still inside the mother so as to facilitate killing it.         <P>       Surely a nation as civilized as ours believes itself to be will not tolerate this ghastly activity.                That the pro-abortion lobby has rallied so vociferously against this legislation -- even prompting a        veto threat from the White House -- reveals better than words just how deep is their commitment        to the abortion cause and industry, and shows who are the true "radical extremists" in this policy        debate.                <P>                      Yours sincerely,                          <P>                                    David A.

The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 28, 1996:                                     <P>                              Dear Representative:     <P>  On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 3103, the "Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996,"        during floor consideration today and tomorrow.      <P>          As you know, this bill is a combination of three separate bills -- HR 3103, HR 3070, and HR 995        -- that went through the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Economic Opportunities Committees,        respectively, and was melded together by the Rules Committee yesterday.  <P>              For three years now, as one of the largest grass-roots groups lobbying on the issue of health care        reform, we have held fast to a set of principles for dealing with health care reform.  They are:<P>                1)     Expanding coverage through portability, done on a group-to-group basis;      <P>  2)     Expanding coverage for individuals through encouraging states to create risk pools   for        persons with pre-existing medical conditions;     <P>      3)    Expanding coverage through the creation of Medical Savings Accounts;     <P>      4)     Reducing costs through the imposition of limits on medical malpractice lawsuits;       <P>    5)     Reducing costs through an increase in the deduction for self-employed workers.          <P>      HR 3103 deals with health insurance reform in a reasonable and limited fashion, in a manner        based on several of these principles.  The legislation would provide for portability of health        insurance coverage on a group-to-group basis; would increase the deduction for self-employed        individuals from 30 to 50 percent; would limit medical malpractice claims, a much-neededchange        that would make health insurance more affordable by lowering insurance premiums for healthcare        providers; would encourage, through tax policy, the creation of state-level high-risk pools; and        would authorize MSAs, a provision which conservatives have supported for years as the only        long-term solution of the health insurance problem.      <P>             We can tell you:  this legislation addresses the problems in the health care delivery system in a        limited, reasonable way, and should garner the support of all those wishing to correct somecurrent        inadequacies in the system without allowing for a government take-over of the industry.                     <P>                    Yours sincerely,                  <P>                       David A.

 The following letter was sent from ACU Chairman, David Keene, to the United States Senate on March 27, 1996:   <P>
                                                  Dear Senator:          <P>      On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to oppose the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment to raise the minimum wage.            <P>    Economists of all stripes agree that the minimum wage has but one guaranteed effect -- to make        job creation more difficult for those small businesses that are the engine of job growth inAmerica,        and to thereby make getting a job more difficult for those seeking entry-level positions.        <P>        Given that our economy has performed anemically over the last several years -- a direct result of        federal government policies which include burdensome regulations, high taxes, and wasteful        spending programs that take otherwise productive dollars out of the private economy and putthem        into unproductive dollars in the public sector economy -- this hardly seems the right time to be        considering raising the costs of offering a job to a prospective employee.      <P>          Could it be that there's something else going on here?  Perhaps a transparent political payoff toBig        Labor, whose bosses just this week endorsed Bill Clinton for reelection -- the earliest-ever        endorsement by the unions of a candidate for the office?  When you take that into consideration,        and add to it the fact that the AFL-CIO bosses also announced this week their plans to raise an        additional $35 million war chest to target 75 House Republicans (combined with their expected        $400 million in-kind donations to Democratic candidates in this fall's elections), one begins to see        a pattern emerging.      <P>          Don't fall for it.  The minimum wage is a job-killer.  At a time when we need to be creating more        new jobs, not less, don't make it more difficult for small businesses to do so.  Reject union boss        pressure and stay firmly on the side of those millions of workers looking for entry-level positions.     <P>                                 Yours sincerely,    <P>                                                          David A.

<h2>Hot Issues<p>

<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 14, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
        Dear Congressman:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support HR 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty and
        Public Safety Act of 1996.&quot;<p>
        
        We believe the bill was strengthened by the passage yesterday of the amendment offered
        by Rep. Barr of Georgia.  No longer do we have to fear the U.S. government infringing
        on the constitutional protections of our citizens through wire-tapping crusades conducted
        willy-nilly, and no longer do we have to fear being charged with a crime for selling
        perfectly legal property which may or may not later be used in the commission of a crime.<p>
        
        Don't believe the liberal media, which has reported that the Barr amendment &quot;gutted&quot; or
        &quot;eviscerated&quot; the legislation.  It did not.  It strengthened it, by ensuring that in our desires
        to crack down on crime and terrorism, we are not gutting the constitutional rights of
        American citizens.<p>
        
        I urge you to vote &quot;yes&quot; on HR 2703.<p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Welfare Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 
5, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Congressman:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support legislation embodying the welfare compromise
        crafted by the National Governors Association.<p>
        
        We believe that, alone of all the possible welfare reform alternatives, the NGA proposal
        passes two critical tests:  it ends the entitlement status of welfare (a reform for which
        conservatives have been fighting for years), and it remains true to the principles of
        federalism (for which conservatives have been fighting for decades).<p>
        
        We understand that several of the leading social conservative groups oppose the NGA
        reform.  As we understand their argument, their opposition to the NGA proposal is
        primarily based on the fact that it doesn't mandate a family cap as established in HR 4.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that allowing states to set their own family caps is not as certain
        a method for seeing to their adoption nation-wide as would be mandating a federal family
        cap, it is also undeniably true that 13 states already have enacted family caps on their own,
        and another seven have already applied for the necessary federal waivers to do so.  We
        believe that more and more states would adopt them as their success was demonstrated in
        the states that have taken the lead already.  This is the essence of federalism.<p>
        
        Moreover, the NGA proposal was adopted unanimously at its early February meeting. 
        Why should a Republican-controlled Congress have a problem agreeing to a proposal
        supported by 50 state governors, most of whom are Republicans?  Isn't the essence of
        conservative government the notion that government governs best which governs closest to
        the people?<p>
        
        As Speaker Gingrich said more than a year ago, conservative micromanagement from
        Washington is just as bad as liberal micromanagement from Washington.<p>
        
        Although it is doubtful that President Clinton would sign the NGA compromise -- and it is
        not even necessary to send him a bill -- it is important for the GOP House to go on record
        supporting a proposal supported by all Democratic governors.  The NGA proposal does
        achieve the over-riding strategic goal of welfare reform:  ending the entitlement status of
        the programs, and returning power to the states.  I urge you to support the NGA proposal.<p>

                              Yours sincerely,

<h2>Hot Issues<p>

<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996

</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
       
        Dear Senator:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I'm writing today to urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the
        product liability conference report, and then to support its final passage.<p>
        
        America's current product liability laws are abused by lawyers seeking to make a &quot;fast
        buck&quot; and so-called consumer organizations seeking to shift blame from consumers to
        others with deep pockets.  The result is to drive up prices, make insurance unaffordable,
        and generally to deprive the public of many products which, when used as the directions
        suggest, are beneficial.<p>
        
        Trial lawyers have argued for years against meaningful reform of product liability laws, on
        the grounds that such changes would make consumers vulnerable to the wishes of so-called
        &quot;rapacious&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot; corporations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
        product liability laws, when amended, would allow those truly to hurt to seek redress.  But
        they would let those of us who do want to buy products, and use them responsibly, to do
        so.<p>
        
        Vote for cloture tomorrow on this important legislation.  And support when it comes to a
        final passage vote.  America's consumers will thank you.<p>
        
           
        <p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Small Business Deregulation</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support S. 942, the small business deregulation bill,
        when it comes to the floor tomorrow.<P>
        
        For far too long, America's small businesses -- the engines of economic growth -- have
        been laboring under a stultifying myriad of regulations, increasing the costs of doing
        business and making difficult the creation of new jobs so vital to the growth of our
        economy.<p>
        
        The bill's specific provisions, we believe, are eminently reasonable, and simply make
        common sense.  Waive fines for first-time offenders if the violations are corrected within a
        reasonable time period.  Let small businesses recoup their legal expenses if they win a
        challenge against excessive enforcement of existing regulations.  And give Congress a 45-day window 
        in which to review and reject newly-issued rules.<p>
        
        Support S. 942 tomorrow.  America's millions of small business owners -- and the people
        who want to work for them -- will be watching.<p>

        <p>
        Dear Congressman:<BR>
        <P>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support H.Con.Res. 148 when it comes to the floor
        tomorrow.<P>
        
        The United States must send a clear message that it will not stand aside while tyrants bully
        a peaceful, prosperous, pro-American neighbor.<P> 
        
        H.Con.Res. 148 expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should demand that
        the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) live up to its prior promises to resolve differences
        with the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) by peaceful means, and that the United
        States should assist in the ROC's defense if the PRC attacks.<P>
        
        For decades, the PRC has relentlessly striven to isolate the ROC from the world
        community. Despite the mainland regime's mean-spirited policy, the ROC is an important,
        influential participant in international affairs. It is one of the few rising democracies in
        East Asia, promoting and protecting economic, political and individual liberty. The ROC's
        national legislature and virtually all provincial and municipal officials are chosen by direct
        popular vote in free elections. This month, for the first time in China's long history, a
        direct popular election for president will occur. The ROC's political and economic
        progress is a textbook model of what bipartisan U.S. policy has always encouraged the
        world over.<P>
        
        Both the PRC and ROC agree that there should be one unified China. Each has long
        claimed to be China's sole legitimate government, but only the ROC has taken positive
        steps toward compromise. It conducts itself under a &QUOT;one China, two governments&QUOT; policy
        while working to resolve other differences case-by-case. Regrettably, recent events again
        underscore the fact that peace derives from strength and only constant pressure and resolve
        make untrustworthy Communists abide by their agreements.<P>
                 
        The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 does not obligate the U. S. to assist the ROC should it
        become a victim of aggression. H.Con.Res. 148 can be an important step toward
        clarifying ambiguity and focusing the moral and political imperatives for U.S. policy. The
        choice is clear: if ever there was a stark case of &QUOT;good guys&QUOT; and &QUOT;bad guys,&QUOT; this is it. <P>
               
    <p>

<h3>A GUIDE TO KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3>

Issue Bulletin No. 222<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:

<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

<title>PRO-FAMILY TAX RELIEF</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Pro-Family Tax Relief</h1>
<h2><i>A Look at Per-Child Credits ... and the Flat Tax</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>N</font>ine years ago, President Reagan's White House 
Working Group on the Family issued a report entitled, <I>The Family: 
Preserving America's Future</I>, which had as its central recommendation
a dramatic expansion in per-child tax benefits.[1] Five years later,
the bipartisan National Commission on Children (on which then-Governor
Bill Clinton served) issued a report entitled <I>Beyond Rhetoric:
A New American Agenda for Children and Families</I>, which also
had as its central recommendation a dramatic increase in per-child
tax benefits.[2]

<p>

Given that leading officials from both parties have been talking
about pro-family tax relief for nearly a decade, the current debate
over per-child tax benefits should center around this question:
does the House GOP's proposed $500 children's tax credit offer
adequate relief to America's families or should Congress instead
move in the direction of the National Commission on Children's
call for a $1,000 per-child tax credit.

<p>

Sadly, that is not the debate taking place in Washington today.
In recent months, a noisy chorus of critics and naysayers have
been raising all sorts of objections to pro-family tax relief.
Their criticisms - which are at times contradictory - advance
a number of myths.

<p>

<center><h3>The Pander Bear Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that pro-family tax relief is an extravagant political
giveaway at odds with the larger public interest.  This idea is
advanced frequently by members of the media, who realize just
how popular pro-family tax relief is.  Rather than thoughtfully
considering the merits of various tax-cutting proposals, these
reporters and pundits smugly sneer at public officials, accusing
them of &quot;pandering&quot; to middle Americans.

<p>

One does not often find himself in the position of defending
politicians, but this sort of activity must be recognized for
what it is -- an attempt by members of the liberal media elite
to make Members of Congress feel guilty about doing what the people
elected them to do.  It is the flipside to the liberal media's
reaction to politicians who advance unpopular tax increases, who
are routinely hailed as &quot;profiles in courage.&quot;

<p>

Voters see nothing courageous about broken campaign promises.
Indeed, few things have contributed more to voter cynicism than
President Bush's failure to keep his &quot;no new taxes&quot;
pledge and President Clinton's decision to abandon his promised
&quot;middle-income tax cut&quot; soon after the 1992 election.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is important that policy-makers<br>
view this as a debate over 'pro-family<br>
tax cuts,' not simply 'middle-income<br>
tax relief.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The American people strongly support pro-family tax relief.
They want to keep more of the money they earn.  They sense that
the well-being of their families -- and the well-being of the nation
-- would improve if they had greater control over their lives.

<p>

On this point, they are right. To acknowledge as much is not
pandering.

<p>

<center><h3>The Bigger Deficit Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some say pro-family tax relief will increase the deficit and
cause interest rates to rise.  It is quite true that the deficit
would rise if a pro-family tax cut were adopted <I>by itself</I>.
It is also quite true that an increase in government borrowing
would contract the supply of funds available for private lending,
thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates.

<p>

But it is important to point out that no one is talking about
adopting a pro-family tax cut <I>by itself</I>.  All of the sponsors
of major legislation have pledged to offset pro-family tax cuts
with dollar-for-dollar reductions in government spending.

<p>

Pro-family tax cuts &quot;paid for&quot;  by spending cuts cancel
each other out on the balance sheet.  They should have no effect
on the deficit or on interest rates.

<p>

<center><h3>The No-Growth Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Another argument often raised is that pro-family tax relief won't
spur economic growth.  This concern comes from those who believe
that tax policy should serve only economic ends, that it should
steer clear of social considerations and focus exclusively on
promoting economic growth.

<p>

There are two problems with this viewpoint.  First, much of what
is called  &quot;economic growth&quot; isn't growth at all.[3]
It is a movement of economic activity from the non-market home
economy to the quantifiable market economy.  For example, when
a family that once cared for its own child enrolls the child in
a paid day care program, there is no increase in the amount of
economic activity.  There is simply a shift from the non-market
economy to the market economy.  Yet this shift is counted as 
&quot;positive&quot; economic growth even though it often has a 
&quot;negative&quot; effect on the child's well-being.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
True economic growth involves an<br>
increase in productivity, not simply<br>
in market activity. Until our nation's<br>
economic debate is built around this<br>
fact, much of what is advanced in the<br>
name of 'growth' ought not to be adopted.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

True economic growth involves an increase in <I>productivity</I>,
not simply in market activity.  Until our nation's economic debate
is built around this fact, much of what is advanced in the name
of &quot;growth&quot; ought not to be adopted.

<p>

The second problem with the &quot;pro-family tax cuts don't spur
growth&quot; myth is that it pretends that economic policy can
be separated from social policy, that the size of a family's tax
burden simply affects its economic well-being and decision-making.
The truth, of course, is that tax policy not only affects people's
economic decision-making (about working, saving, spending, investing,
etc.) but also their &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making
(about marrying, childbearing, childrearing, etc.).

<p>

While it is true that economic policy should strive to exert
as little influence as possible over &quot;non-economic&quot;
decisions (so that, for example, people who otherwise would not
marry won't get married just for the tax breaks), it is also true
that our nation's current economic policies exert considerable
influence over &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making and that
this influence is almost always in an <I>anti-family</I> direction.

<p>

For example, Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute has shown
that the Social Security system has a pernicious anti-child bias
because it robs parents of the social insurance value of their
children, thereby creating a disincentive for young couples to
invest in childrearing.[4] Indeed, if Congress were to seek to
offset this bias via the tax code (which is the only apparent
option given Social Security's sacrosanct status), it would have
to raise actual per-child savings to roughly $2,100 per child.[5]
When one considers that the net value of the current child tax
exemption is less than $400 per child (for the average family)
and that the high-water mark in the current debate is an additional
$500 per-child tax credit, it is easy to see why many people are
disappointed that the proposals currently being considered aren't
even bolder -- or to use the media's phrase, more courageous.

<p>

Of course, some are reluctant to adopt even a $500 credit because
they are intimidated by the economic &quot;cost&quot; in lost
revenue to the government.  While anti-family policies that took
more than 50 years to develop cannot be wiped out in 50 (or even
100) days, it is important to recognize that there is a social
&quot;cost&quot; to inaction or compromise.  The social &quot;cost&quot;
of weak families is measured in things like divorce rates and
crime statistics.  And these social problems impose enormous economic
costs on our society and our government.  Indeed, the best way
to reduce the demand for government services is to free families
to care for themselves.  Conversely, the best way to hinder the
dismantling of the welfare state is to leave the tax burden on
families with children at or near their current levels so that
families have a difficult time taking back responsibilities from
the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>The Middle-Class Only Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Should pro-family tax relief go only to middle-class taxpayers?
Some say so.

<p>

This concern makes the mistake of viewing tax issues through
the prism of class rather than through the prism of family.  It
is true that middle-class Americans often get short shrift in
current tax policy.  (For example, when combined employer-employee
payroll taxes are added to income taxes, some lower-middle-income
couples actually have a marginal tax rate comparable to 
upper-middle-income individuals in the 28 percent bracket.)

<p>

But it is even more true that families with children are shortchanged
in current tax policy.  For example, during the first four decades
after the end of WWII, the income tax burden on singles and childless
couples increased only slightly, while it increased more than
200 percent for families with two children.[6] Reagan-era reforms
helped to reverse this trend moderately, but the dramatic shift
in tax burden from non-parents to parents still dwarfs any shift
in tax burden along income lines.

<p>

Thus, it is important that policymakers view this as a debate
over &quot;pro-family tax cuts,&quot; not simply &quot;middle-income
tax relief.&quot;  This is the way both the 1986 Working Group
and the 1991 National Commission on Children saw the issue.  Indeed,
neither of these reports advocated any type of means-testing on
per-child benefits.  Both recognized that the principle being
advanced was tax relief for families of all incomes to use in
raising children, not tax relief to people who happen to fall
into an income category that everyone considers middle-class (a
category that invariably shrinks as public debate progresses).

<p>

The fact that tax relief should be first and foremost pro-family
does not mean that policymakers should be unconcerned about the
distributional impact of these cuts.  To its credit, the House
GOP plan extends relief in the form of a per-child credit rather
than an increased per-child exemption.  In actual dollar terms,
a credit provides equal relief to all taxpayers; but in 
percentage-of-tax-burden terms, it offers greater relief to working-class 
and middle-income taxpayers than to wealthier taxpayers. (Tax exemptions, 
conversely, skew savings up the income scale, offering greater per-child 
savings to those in higher brackets.)

<p>

This is not to say that tax exemptions are always inferior to
tax credits; for example, one of the virtues of the current exemption
is that its value rises if tax rates rise, thereby guaranteeing
continued horizontal tax equity between parents and non-parents
at any income level.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The best way to reduce the demand<br>
for government services is to free<br>
families to care for themselves.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Still, given the tax code's current problems, a non-means-tested
tax credit is the best mechanism for helping families with children.
Indeed, if Congress wanted to maximize its distributional bang
for buck, it might want to consider a non-refundable version of
the 1991 National Commission on Children's $1,000 credit (which
replaced the existing exemption, thereby offering $600+ in net
per-child relief to those in the 15 percent tax bracket, but less
than $300 in net per-child tax relief to those in higher tax brackets).
Moving in this direction would make it easier for Congress to
lift the existing (and newly-proposed) income caps on per-child
benefits -- a problem that definitely needs addressing since income
caps at any level produce marriage penalties.

<p>

Speaking of marriage penalties, the income caps on the Earned
Income Tax Credit have created such a serious anti-marriage effect
that Congress should use all of the monies set aside in the marriage
penalty section of the American Dream Restoration Act to address
the marriage bias facing families earning below the median income.
The Talent-Faircloth welfare reform initiative from 1994 called
for a $1,000 pro-marriage tax credit.  This would be a constructive,
problem-solving first step.  It ought to be adopted.

<p>

<center><h3>The Can't Trust Parents Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some believe pro-family tax relief should tie benefits to family
expenses (like education) that the government should promote.
This concern springs from the notion that the government knows
more about what families should spend their money for than parents
do.

<p>

Not only is this a false premise, but it leads to all sorts of
unproductive economic distortions.  Indeed, one of the chief reasons
college tuition costs have been rising at a pace exceeding the
general inflation rate is that many students have been given grants
and loans that could be used only for educational purposes.  Knowing
this to be the case, college administrators have raised the cost
of higher education beyond what it would be if students' economic
resources were completely fungible and available for multiple
uses.

<p>

While no one wants to discourage bright young people from pursuing
a higher education, the sad truth is that tax cuts earmarked for
this or any other family expense will have the effect of increasing
the cost of that good or service, thereby exacerbating current
problems and putting a college education out of the reach of some
interested students.  In addition, tax deductions keyed to college
tuition expenses benefit students attending higher-priced schools
more than other students.

<p>

While it would be counter-productive for Congress to provide
tax cuts for specific expenses, it would be helpful for Congress
to modify existing Individual Retirement Account (IRA) rules to
permit taxpayers to enjoy tax-favored savings for a wider variety
of purposes (college tuition, first-time home-buying, etc.). 
In the first case, Congress would be limiting families' economic
freedom, in the second, it would be expanding it.

This is not to say, however, that the Super IRA included in the
House GOP Contract should be adopted in its current form.  The
&quot;back-loaded&quot; nature of its design obligates future
generations to an economic promise made today.  Given the size
of the federal debt, and the pernicious anti-family influence
of intergenerational entitlement programs, Congress should steer
clear of repeating past mistakes.  If tax-favored savings are
to be expanded, they should be expanded within the context of
a &quot;front-loaded&quot; savings mechanism.

<p>

<center><h3>Armey's Flat Tax Appeal</h3></center>

<p>

While the proposed increase in per-child tax benefits is commanding
center stage in the current debate, there is growing interest
in a flat tax proposal sponsored by House GOP Minority Leader
Dick Armey.  The Armey proposal, which some Republicans want to
make a central plank in the 1996 GOP campaign platform, would
reduce the federal income tax form to the size of a post card
by eliminating all existing deductions, exemptions, and credits.
Thus, after claiming &quot;personal allowances&quot; (which allow
taxpayers to adjust their tax liability for family size), all
taxpayers would pay income taxes at a 17 percent marginal rate.

<p>

As such, the Armey plan has a number of appealing features.
These include:

<ul><p>

<li><b><i>Simplicity</i></b>.  Despite periodic attempts to make
tax filing easier, America's tax code is
littered with so many cumbersome rules, regulations, and stipulations
that many ordinary taxpayers feel justifiably overwhelmed.  Eliminating
the tax code's complexity would reduce errors and encourage respect
for and compliance with the code.  It would also free people to
make more productive use of the time they now devote to income
tax compliance.  According to economist Walter Williams of George
Mason University, Americans spend more than six billion hours
each year on record keeping, tax planning, and tax return preparation.
If those same hours were spent producing useful things, Williams
says they would be equal to the combined output of our auto, truck,
and aircraft industries.[7]

<p>

<li><b><i>No Withholding</i></b>.  Rather than continuing the
current system of having employers
withhold income taxes from employees' wages, the Armey plan would
permit taxpayers to take home their entire gross earnings and
then make a monthly tax payment to the government (much as they
currently make a monthly mortgage payment to their lending company).
Eliminating wage withholding would free employers from burdensome
administrative paperwork -- and would help taxpayers see just how
large their tax bite is.  Nothing fosters high taxes more than
the fact that they are currently &quot;hidden&quot; from full
view by wage withholding.  Were all earnings to &quot;pass through&quot;
taxpayers' wallets, Americans would undoubtedly become more aware
of their current tax burden -- and of any changes to it in the
future.

<p>

<li><b><i>Reduced Marriage Penalty</i></b>.  The Armey plan eliminates
most existing marriage penalties in the current income tax code by 
offering marrieds a personal allowance twice that of singles and by 
eliminating all tax rate progressivity. (By retaining the &quot;head of 
household&quot; filing category for single parents, the marriage penalty 
is not eliminated altogether.)  Given the size of the current penalty
(particularly among the working poor) and the larger cultural
need to strengthen the institution of marriage, the Armey plan's
improved treatment of marriage compares well to current law.

<p>

<li><b><i>No Junk</i></b>.  While there is a case to be made for
tax simplification for simplification's
sake, the Armey plan's eradication of existing deductions and
credits has the added virtue of eliminating many ill-conceived
tax write-offs.  For example, the deductibility of state and local
taxes has the effect of redistributing income from people living
in low-tax areas to people living in high-tax states.  Similarly,
the dependant care tax credit has the effect of redistributing
income from families that care for their own children to families
that enroll their children in day care.  Eliminating such write-offs
would eliminate economic distortions and perverse social incentives.

<p>

<li><b><i>Generous Family Benefits</i></b>.  The Armey plan proposes
personal allowances of $13,100
for singles, $26,200 for marrieds, and $5,300 for each dependent
child.  As such, a typical family of four would not begin paying
income taxes until it has earned $36,800 in income.  Although
these family benefits are less generous than those which existed
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they are considerably higher
than current thresholds (which shield a family of four's first
$16,150 from income taxation).

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Challenges for The Armey Approach</h3></center>

<p>

While the Armey plan has many appealing features, it also faces
a number of challenges -- challenges that will need to be addressed
before the Armey plan (or any variation of it) can be adopted.
These include:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Doesn't The Federal Government Already Have An Effective
Flat Tax?</i></b> Most &quot;flat
tax&quot; proponents think only in terms of leveling federal
income taxes.  But America's taxpayers not only pay federal income
taxes but also federal payroll taxes.  The combined employer-employee
share of payroll taxes is just over 15 percent for taxpayers earning
up to $60,600.  This means that most working-class and middle-income
families have a combined marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent
(divided almost equally between payroll and income taxes).  This
amount is comparable to the marginal tax rate of upper-middle-income
taxpayers in the 28 and 31 percent income tax brackets.

<p>

If Congress were to adopt the Armey plan, and to leave in place
the existing payroll tax, taxpayers in the current 15 percent
income tax bracket would see their combined marginal tax rate
rise to over 32 percent (because Armey replaces the 15 percent
rate with a 17 percent rate).  Meanwhile, upper-middle-income
taxpayers (whose incomes exceed the current cap on payroll taxes)
would experience a dramatic reduction in marginal tax rates from
28 and 31 percent to 17 percent.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Nothing fosters high taxes more<br>
than the fact that they are<br>
currently hidden from full<br>
view by wage witholding.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Armey proponents choose not to address the payroll tax question,
arguing that social security &quot;contributions&quot; should
be viewed as mandatory payments to a pension plan rather than
taxes to support a cash transfer program.  Given that taxpayers
have no control of these &quot;mandatory payments,&quot; Congress
should alter the construct of the Armey plan so that it takes
payroll taxes into consideration.  This would ensure that taxpayers
earning below $60,600 would not have higher marginal tax rates
than those making above $60,600.

<p>

<li><b><i>Doesn't Rate Progressivity Offset The Anti-Family Aspects
Of The Social Security System?</i></b> Allan Carlson of the Rockford 
Institute argues that &quot;the effect of a flat income tax rate at levels
above 10 percent is to weaken the family as an economic unit.&quot;[8]
Carlson believes a progressive income tax is preferable because
rate progressivity encourages non-market home production over
market production.  Given that the long-term health of our society
(and, for that matter, the long-term health of our economy) would
be threatened by the shift of certain responsibilities from families
and volunteer associations to the market economy, Carlson believes
taxwriters should attempt to make the tax code more progressive
rather than less.  (He would take the revenues generated by greater
progressivity and devote them to a $1,500 per-child credit and
a revival of income-splitting to solve the marriage penalty problem.)

<p>

While Carlson's call for greater progressivity is unlikely to
find an audience with most GOP policymakers, it is important to
point out that the case for a flat tax is seriously weakened by
the social security system's anti-child bias.  If there were no
social security system, parents would have a natural economic
incentive to invest in childrearing because their economic security
in old age would be directly linked to their children's future
productivity.  In other words, in a world without social security,
the workaholic who neglects his childrearing responsibilities
puts himself at risk in old age because his children may turn
out to be dolts or sloths incapable of offering him support if
needed.

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

In a world with social security, however, the workaholic who
neglects his childrearing responsibilities puts himself at no
such risk.  If his kids turn out to be unproductive, he does not
suffer -- so long as there are plenty of well-reared children from
other families capable of keeping the system afloat.

<p>

Thankfully, economic incentives are not the only factors -- or
even the primary factors -- influencing parental investments in
children.  Moral imperatives still carry much sway.

<p>

But lest anyone think economic factors are irrelevant, consider
how often one hears talk today from families that say they &quot;can't
afford another child&quot; or &quot;can't afford to have one parent
stay home with young children because they have to have two paychecks.&quot;

<p>

In the abstract, one can easily make a case that an ideal economic
system would have neither a progressive income tax nor an old-age
social insurance scheme.

<p>

Given that no modification in social security is being proposed,
proponents of the Armey flat tax must explain how they would propose
to counteract policy-based incentives for parents to neglect their
non-market childrearing duties.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Does Eliminating Charitable Contributions Square
With A Larger Social Vision That Wants To Replace Government Welfare 
With Private Charity?</i></b> 
To their credit, most proponents of the Armey flat tax are also
advocates of limited government who would like to see the welfare
state dismantled and replaced by private charity.  While this
philosophy does not obligate one to support the continuation
of tax write-offs for charitable contributions, it may be asking
too much to expect the American people simultaneously to support
an elimination of charitable tax deductions and a dismantling
of government welfare programs.  Given the serious social problems
associated with government welfare programs, Congress should do
nothing that might have the effect of undermining public support
for dismantling the welfare state.  Not only does this argue for
the retention of charitable contributions, it actually argues
for an expansion of them.

<p>

Here again, the question is not necessarily one of what is best
in the abstract.  The question, instead, is whether the goal of
a deduction-free tax code should supersede all other goals -- including
the goal of shifting welfare responsibilities from the state to
the charitable sector.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Will Eliminating The Deductibility Of Mortgage Interest
Affect Property Values And The Real Net Worth Of Families?</i></b> Just 
as charitable contributions present a dilemma to Armey flat tax 
proponents, so too do home mortgage interest payments.

<p>

While the intellectual case for mortgage interest deductions
is far weaker than for charitable contributions -- in fact, Carlson
argues that mortgage interest deductions have had an anti-family
effect by encouraging smaller households and spurring artificial
growth in housing prices[9] -- the problem is that eliminating the
mortgage interest deduction that is now in place could have an
even more serious anti-family effect.  Many families have a considerable
share of their entire net worth tied up in their homes.  If a
proposal eliminating the mortgage interest deduction were to pass,
and thereby to pull the rug out from under property owners, the
social and economic effects could be quite serious.  Indeed, the
recession that occurred during the Bush Administration was caused
in part by a decline in home values.  As families saw their net
worth falling, they understandably felt less freedom to make new
purchases.

<p>

It is possible, as Armey proponents maintain, that the negative
effect on property values of eliminating home mortgage deductibility
will be offset by the positive effect of greater economic growth
in other parts of the economy.  But it is also quite possible
that consumers will respond to the elimination of home mortgage
deductibility in the same manner they responded to the housing
recession of the late 1980s.

<p>

Given that those who have the most to lose from instability in
the housing market are young families who have recently purchased
first homes, Congress must proceed very cautiously in this area.

<p>

<li><b><i>Won't The Value Of Pro-Family Benefits Decline As The
Legislative Process Unfolds?</i></b> As noted earlier, the Armey tax 
plan includes
adjustments for family size that exceed current law.  While this
is one of the plan's most laudable features, there is reason to
believe that the benefit levels leaving the starting gate of the
legislative process would never survive the marathon to the finish
line.  The reason is simple:  if any change is made in the Armey
plan that would have the effect of reducing revenues (such as
reinserting certain tax write-offs) the only options Armey would
have would be:

<p><ul>

(1)  to increase the deficit;<br>
(2)  to raise the tax rate above 17 percent; or<br>
(3)  to reduce family benefits.

</ul><p>

The first option would be unlikely in any scenario, but is especially
so given that Armey's proposal, by his own estimates, would raise
$40 billion less than current law (and some claim the shortfall
would be as much as four times this amount).  Indeed, given the
level of concern that has already arisen about revenue shortfalls,
it is quite possible that family tax benefits could be raided
even if no other changes were made to the Armey plan.

<p>

The second option -- raising the tax rate above 17 percent -- is
also unlikely because the political support for the flat tax largely
hangs or falls on the size of this number.  Tax policy is mysterious
to most Americans.  Average citizens are far more likely to follow
fluctuations in the flat rate structure than fluctuations in the
family benefits -- especially since the premise of the debate is
that we need a flat <I>rate</I>.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Those who believe the most serious<br>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Thus, those who believe the most serious problem in the current
tax code is the absence of significant pro-family benefits are
poorly served by a debate that emphasizes rates rather than the
size of pro-family benefits.

<p>

Indeed, one of the virtues of the existing debate surrounding
the House GOP's Contract proposal is that it has centered around
the $500 per-child figure.  While this amount should be higher,
it will be difficult for Members of Congress to pass something
less than this amount without having to do an awful lot of explaining
to their constituents. Hopefully, Armey proponents can find
a way to offer this level of protection to pro-family benefits
during the legislative process.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Family First</h3></center>

<p>

After years of talk but no action on the pro-family tax front,
Congress appears poised to finally adopt some significant per-child
relief.  This is long overdue.  In 1948, a median income family
of four sent two percent of its annual income to the federal government
in federal income and payroll taxes.  Today, that same family
sends 24.5 percent of its income to the Federal Treasury.[10] The
erosion in the value of per-child benefits is the primary reason
for this dramatic increase in the income tax burden of America's
families.  According to Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute,
the current child exemption would need to be quadrupled in size
in order to offset the same percentage of income that the exemption
shielded from taxation in 1948.[11]

<p>

Given the magnitude of this historic shift, nothing -- including
the possibility of making even more dramatic tax changes in the
near future -- should deter Congress from adopting at least $500
in per-child tax savings.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>The Limits of Tax Relief</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>hile it is important for Members of Congress to 
recognize the virtues of pro-family tax relief, it is also important 
for them to recognize the limitations of pro-family relief.

<p>

Pro-family tax relief will not make husbands love their wives
or children respect their parents.  It will not clear up filthy
TV or remove child predators from our streets.  In short, pro-family
tax relief, by itself, will not magically solve the myriad social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.

<p>

But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parent
them from other harms by freeing them to spend more of their time
with their children and less of their time frantically chasing
the almighty, overtaxed dollar.

<p>

In short, pro-family tax relief will empower parents to address
many family needs that only they can meet.

<p>

America needs parents who want to raise their children well.
But we also need policies that empower them to act upon these
sentiments.

<p>

The 104th Congress should adopt nothing less than $500 in per-child
tax relief for all taxpaying families.

<title>FREEING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Freeing America's Schools</h1>
<h2><i>The Case Against the U.S. Education Department</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>A</font> century and a half ago, Alexis de 
Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and 
bureaucratization saps civic and individual responsibility. 
"[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the 
nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their 
local spirit",[1] wrote Tocqueville.

<p>

Cathy Duffy, in a new book titled <i>Government Nannies</i>, 
echoes Tocqueville's observation: "History and common sense 
tell us that people are more likely to assume responsibility 
when they know that no one else will.  If I knew that no one 
else was going to watch my car's gas gauge and remind me to 
fill the tank before it hits empty, I would do it myself.  
But my husband watches it closely and puts gas in the car for 
me.  As a result of his kindness, I rarely look at the gas gauge."[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, many Americans seem to have forgotten this principle 
and have yielded responsibility for certain domestic functions to 
central planners working in the federal government.  Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in the area of education, where increased 
bureaucratic control has bred local apathy which, in turn, has bred 
greater bureaucratic control.  Indeed, many contemporary Americans 
resemble the 19th century European described by Tocqueville:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The condition of his village, the police of his street, the 
repairs of the church or the parsonage, do not concern him; 
for he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself 
and as the property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the 
government....  This want of interest in his own affairs goes 
so far that if his own safety or that of his children is at last 
endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold 
his arms and wait till the whole nation comes to his aid....</i>[3]

</blockquote>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Tocqueville warns that, when a nation reaches this point, 
"it must either change its customs and its laws, or perish; 
for the source of public virtues is dried up; and though it 
may contain subjects, it has no citizens."[4]

<p>

<center><h3>Ending the Federal Role in Education</h3></center>

<p>

The United States Constitution is a document of enumerated powers. 
That is, the Federal government is permitted to do only what the 
Constitution specifically lists.  This is expressed clearly and 
succinctly in the 10th amendment:   "The powers not delegated to 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>

Since education is not listed as a Federal responsibility, it was 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of states and localities through 
most of our history.  Things began to change in the 1930s when the 
New Deal brought increasing Federal involvement.  Later, under 
Eisenhower, a cabinet-level department was created:  Health, 
Education and Welfare.  And under the Johnson Administration, 
passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expanded 
federal involvement further.

<p>

Then, in 1976, Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter 
promised the creation of a separate education department if 
elected and received the backing of the National Education 
Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter set 
about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition 
from the American Federation of Teachers (the second-largest teacher 
union), from much of higher education, and from the general public. 
The AFL-CIO attacked the idea[5] and even the liberal <i>Washington 
Post</i> argued that "shifting federal education programs to a 
separate department increases bureaucratic costs."[6]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Hawaiians could manage these<br>
programs more efficiently and<br>
less expensively than the federal<br>
government. And if Hawaiians, then<br>
why not Carolinians, Vermonters,<br>
and Texans, as well?
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Many Americans feared that a cabinet-level department would 
lead to an expanded federal role in education.  Marvin Stone, 
in an editorial in <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, put it 
this way:   Would the Education Department have the power to 
tamper with America's traditional local control of education? 
Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there 
is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent 
according to the purposes of the donors  -- or else.[7]

<p>

While the bill establishing the department stated emphatically 
that the Department would not undermine state and local control, 
Stone noted:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

...a subtle schizophrenia, meandering through the legislation and 
the committee appraisal, suggests that the authors' inward dream 
for the department runs at odds with the stated restrictions. One 
keeps encountering such phrases as  "implement...at the local level" 
...  "assesses the achievement of federal objectives" ... and 
"monitoring parental and public participation."</i>[8]

</blockquote>

<p>

Today, Stone's essay seems prophetic.  The <i>Guide to U.S. 
Department of Education Programs</i> lists 241 separate programs, 
many of which have usurped the prerogatives of the states.  For 
example, the index identifies six programs exclusively for Native 
Hawaiians.  It is instructive to imagine tax monies garnered in 
Oahu, transferred to a federal bureaucracy 6,000 miles away, 
filtered expensively through Washington's education blob, and the 
remainder returned to the island state for Native Hawaiian 
education.  It is not difficult to believe that Hawaiians could 
manage these programs more efficiently and less expensively than 
the federal government.  And if Hawaiians, then why not Carolinians, 
Vermonters, and Texans as well?

<p>

The U.S. Education Department, then, is an entity with a dubious 
past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the 
strictures of Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances 
of its birth were suspect -- more or less a political payoff 
to the NEA.  Furthermore, the U.S. Education Department has 
not improved American education.

<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to  "[o]ur 
Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent 
and open in the world...."[9] No longer so.  According to 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges would not be 
admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[10] 
The 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) declared 
that as many as half of elementary and secondary students do not 
demonstrate  "competency in challenging subject matter in English, 
mathematics, science, history, and geography.  Further, even fewer 
are able to use their minds well."[11]

Meanwhile, the U.S. Education Department has grown into a huge 
bureaucratic blob.  It has elbowed its way into places it does 
not belong, not the least of which are local schools and family 
life.

<p>

<center><h3>Goals 2000</h3></center>

<p>

On March 31, 1994, federal intrusiveness reached a new height with 
passage of Goals 2000.  Groundwork for the program was being laid 
as early as 1987 when Richard Riley and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
served on the Southern Regional Education Board's (SREB) Commission 
on Educational Quality.  Bill Clinton also participated in SREB 
meetings.  The commission developed a set of goals and published 
<i>Goals for Education:  Challenge 2000</i> in 1988.[12] In 1989, 
President Bush summoned the nation's governors to an educational 
summit meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia.  At this gathering, 
then-Governor Clinton played a major role in leading the governors 
to adopt six ambitious national goals for education.  These goals 
formed the basis of America 2000, President Bush's plan for 
education reform.

<p>

The America 2000 plan represented a dramatic departure from 
the American political tradition in education, as explained 
by John F. Jennings, director of the Center on National 
Education Policy:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had proposed a major 
expansion of federal aid to education in the 1960s and had 
achieved the enactment of historic legislation that created 
the current array of federal programs.  But they were dogged 
along the way by criticism from conservatives who asserted that 
the liberals were really trying to nationalize education.  Now, 
25 years later, it was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, 
not a liberal Democrat, who was advocating <b>a monumental 
movement away from local control of education</b>.</i>[13] 
<i>(emphasis added)

</i></blockquote>

<p>

While Bush failed to get both Houses of Congress to adopt his 
plan, President Clinton was quick to seize the initiative on 
this issue soon after his election in 1992.  Clinton expanded 
Bush's plan, renamed it Goals 2000, and made it the cornerstone 
of his Education Department's agenda.

<p>

The reach of Goals 2000 as educational innovation can hardly be 
overstated.  Albert Shanker of the American Federation of 
Teachers called it  "the most important piece of education 
legislation we've ever had."[14] And Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley wrote,  "For the first time in the nation's 
history, a statutory framework defining an appropriate role 
for the federal government has been enacted."[15]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Goals 2000 includes national<br>
education goals and standards<br>
that override local priorities<br>
and ignore the fact that many<br>

standards for student learning.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Goals 2000 provides a framework for restructuring the American 
system of education, creating tighter and more definite links 
between the federal, state and local levels.  This makes it 
even easier for the Education Department to tamper with local 
schools than Marvin Stone once envisioned.

<p>

Indeed, Goals 2000 includes national education goals and standards 
that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many 
private entities have developed standards for student learning. 
E.D. Hirsch, for example, has written a series of books on cultural 
literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level. 
The Family Research Council has published an outline of U.S. history 
entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>. William Bennett's best-selling 
<i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source of America's literary 
heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for high academic 
standards.

<p>

What is revolutionary about Goals 2000 is the idea that the federal 
government should be involved in creating and certifying standards 
for education and in determining  "official knowledge."

<p>

The goals, themselves, are highly problematic.  First, they smack 
of Utopianism.  They illustrate the 
"with-a-stroke-of-this-pen-I-change-the-world" kind of thought that 
sometimes afflicts high-level bureaucrats and politicians. For 
example,[16] Goal Six says that every adult American will be 
literate.  Since some estimates put the number of adult illiterates 
at nearly four million and the number of functional illiterates at 
30 million, their re-education would require a national mobilization 
akin to fighting World War I.  And these are <b>adults</b> -- 
outside the scope of compulsory education.  Goals like this with 
a timetable like this (all problems solved in six years!) are so 
unrealistic as to undermine public confidence in the politicians 
and the educational establishment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
'National standards' could<br>
actually work to 'dumb down'<br>
educational expectations<br>
rather than to raise them.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The goals also have coercive implications.  Goal One says "all 
children in America will start school ready to learn."  Assuming 
the statement is not mere rhetoric, how will the government meet 
this goal?  Or consider Goal Eight:   "Every school will promote 
partnerships that will increase parental involvement and 
participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic 
growth of children."  Note the peremptory  "will": these 
"partnerships" are not optional.  They instruct school officials 
to direct parents rather than stating that parents are to be 
primarily responsible for their children's education. Moreover, 
Goals 2000 defines parental involvement in mostly peripheral 
terms: parent-teacher conferences, PTA meetings, etc.

<p>

Goal Three says that "American students will leave grade four, 
eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency in challenging 
subject matter...."  Who decides what  "challenging subject matter" 
is, and what is  "demonstrated competency" over it?  The Goals 2000 
law created a new federal agency, the National Educational Standards 
and Improvement Council (NESIC).  Under the law, states may draw up 
state educational standards or use the national standards that will 
also be made available.  All of this was declared, in the Goals 2000 
law itself, to be entirely voluntary.  Indeed, among its supporters, 
Goals 2000 is hardly mentioned without the assuring  "voluntary" 
prefix.  Calling it  "voluntary" is actually highly misleading, 
especially in light of other legislation.  As Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley said of the Goals 2000 law,  "We were determined that 
Goals 2000 become the prism through which amendments to every other 
program in elementary and secondary education would be considered."[17]

<p>

One such program is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA), under which 90 percent of the schools in the nation 
receive funding.  Under <i>this</i> law states cannot receive federal 
funding for elementary and secondary education unless they follow 
an application process nearly identical to that contained in Goals 
2000.  In fact the ESEA declares that  "[i]f a State has State 
content standards or State student performance standards developed 
under title III of the Goals 2000:  Educate America Act and an 
aligned set of assessments...the State shall use such standards 
and assessments"[18] as its plan to be submitted for application 
purposes.

<p>

Some argue that Goals 2000 is voluntary because states are free to 
write standards of their own.  The catch is that even these state 
standards must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education in 
order for the state to receive Goals 2000 funds.  What kind of 
standards are the feds likely to approve?  Since there will be 
federal standards and curriculum for each discipline, no state 
will be left guessing.  And no one who understands human nature 
will be left guessing about what all the states' materials will 
tend to look like. "National standards" sounds challenging: 
they aren't. The U.S. Education Department, for example, recently 
sued Ohio for imposing an eighth grade reading requirement as a 
condition of high school graduation. The standard was too 
restrictive, too discriminatory. Thus, "national standards" 
could actually work to  "dumb down" educational expectations, 
rather than to raise them.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>Faulty Standards</h3></center>

<p>

Consider the U.S. history standards, written by the Center for 
History in the Schools at UCLA under a $2 million grant from the 
U.S. Education Department and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities.  They contain many historical facts and interesting 
teaching strategies.  But nothing could better demonstrate the 
dangers of a national curriculum.  The standards are replete 
with political correctness.  Paul Revere, Thomas Edison, J.P. 
Morgan, the Wright Brothers, Alexander Graham Bell, Robert E. 
Lee, and Albert Einstein are all omitted; yet, Madonna, Speckled 
Snake and The Simpsons are included.

<p>

The standards not only trivialize American history, but also 
present an exceedingly gloomy view of America.  Nobody wants 
a history written through rose-colored glasses --  but the 
standards go beyond an honest appraisal of national failures, 
replacing  "America: land of opportunity," with  "America: land 
of oppression."  As Albert Shanker pointed out, no other 
government has tried to teach its children to have negative 
feelings about their own country.[19]

<p>

Political correctness also colors many of the questions and 
assignments in the history standards.  For example, students 
are asked to  "explain how feminism was compelling in its 
analysis of women's problems and solutions offered."  To the 
ideologically charged individuals who wrote the standards, 
feminist ideology could only be  "compelling."  But for many 
Americans, this premise is highly debatable.  That there is 
such a disagreement should not be a problem.  Histories should 
acknowledge diversity of opinion, instead of pretending that all 
people hold the same views.  It is highly ironic that those whose 
very creed is  "diversity" should seek to ignore and marginalize 
opinion when it differs from their own.

<p>

Another weakness of the standards has been little noted in the 
national discussion:  they contain virtually no explanation of 
what communism is and what it did.  It is difficult to see how 
any student could make sense of the 20th century without 
understanding what Marx and Lenin taught and how Stalin acted 
on those teachings.  The Cold War for example -- nearly half a 
century of American history -- becomes inexplicable.  During this 
century, Soviet Communism was responsible for at least 60 million 
deaths.  Adding Communist China brings the toll to many millions 
more.  Without an understanding of this, the student could only 
consider the collision of democracy and Communism to be like some 
pointless dynastic or boundary-marker squabble of the distant past.

<p>

Indeed, the history standards implicitly subscribe to the doctrine 
of moral equivalence, describing the Cold War merely as "swordplay 
of the Soviet Union and the United States," and making no mention of 
Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.  They 
describe  "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> 
disaster, while omitting any reference to John Glenn or the successful 
U.S. moon landing.  Columnist George Will says they show a "cranky 
anti-Americanism."[20]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical 
to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local 
schools?  Partly, as we have seen, through subterfuge: the 
insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because 
the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that 
only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this 
conviction is based on the fallacy that the federal government has 
money of its own.  In reality, the only money the U.S. Education 
Department has is money that citizens once earned.  Think back to 
the example of the federal programs for Native Hawaiians.  They 
typify every federal education program:  the money localities give 
up to Washington is returned to them -- much diminished.  The 
total U.S. Education Department budget has reached a level of $30 
billion dollars.  What if this money were simply routed to the local 
schools instead of being routed through the federal bureaucracy? It 
tickles the imagination to think of the textbooks and desks and 
computers and art classes and chemistry labs and gymnasiums and 
field trips and new teachers that could be financed with the savings.

<p>

There would be another great advantage for localities if the 
federal government got out of the education business.  There 
is a misperception that Washington provides the lion's share 
of education funding in this nation.  In reality, federal 
spending accounts for only about 6.5 percent[21] of the funding 
that goes into local education. Yet, "Uncle Sam's leverage 
over U.S. education is greater than his six or seven percent of 
the school budget would indicate," notes Chester Finn, former 
assistant secretary of education under President Reagan.[22] 
Overbearing federal regulations hinder local school freedom. 
Getting the federal education bureaucracy out of our pockets 
and off our backs should liberate local leaders and infuse 
communities with a new sense of local spirit.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

President Carter, arguing in 1979 for the establishment of a U.S. 
Education Department, boasted: "Under the proposal I am submitting 
today, the Department of Education will include more than 150 programs 
and 16,200 employees.  With a budget of more than $13 billion, this 
Department will be larger than five other Departments including Energy, 
Commerce, Justice, Interior and State."[23] Such was the sentiment with 
which the U.S. Education Department was formed.  Few politicians would 
dare to highlight these facts today.  In its 15 years of existence the 
U.S. Education Department has added 100 programs, more than doubled its 
annual expenditures, and doubled its outlays as a percentage of total 
federal spending, from one percent to two percent.[24] In hindsight, 
it is clear that enlarging the federal role in education was a mistake. 
As early as 1981, policy analysts recognized that "the creation of this 
Department was a mistake, that its enactment is analogous to an inversion 
of the proverbial miller's tale, spinning something fine back into 
something coarse."[25] The federal government should no longer have a 
role in American education.

<p>

<center><h3>Common Objections</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that the U.S. Education Department must be preserved 
because of four seemingly critical functions of the federal department: 
helping the disabled, protecting civil rights, providing college loans, 
and conducting national educational research.  But there is reason to 
believe that these functions can be handled by state and local 
governments and by private entities.  Indeed, one-size-fits-all 
administrative policies handed down by the federal government have 
often proved counter-productive.  Consider, for example, special 
education.

<p>

The federal government's spending on special education accounts for 
a very small percentage of the cost of educating each student with 
disabilities -- only eight percent.  Yet, its regulations define the 
special education policies which local schools must follow.

<p>

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) began two 
decades ago with the purpose of providing all children with handicaps 
a "free and appropriate public education."  After many reauthorizations 
and amendments, the federal special education requirements are now 
numerous, detailed and cumbersome.  Schools are instructed to place 
students in the  "least restrictive environment."  Today this policy 
is defined as full inclusion.  That means that the regular classroom 
must be the first option for all children with handicaps, and many in 
the education establishment, ignoring the fact that diverse needs require 
diverse solutions, are determined to make the regular classroom the "best 
option" by bringing in aides, special materials, equipment, etc.[26] As 
Albert Shanker has said,  "The argument on the part of inclusionists 
rests on the social benefits of education.  Some have even stated that 
they don't care if other children don't learn to read and write, if 
they have learned to 'get along.'"[27]

<p>

The federally mandated policy of inclusion presents an excellent 
example of why a federal Education Department is ineffective and 
inappropriate.  A single national policy cannot meet the needs of 
all students.  Nowhere is this more true than in special education, 
where a student's learning depends largely on how closely teaching 
methods meet his or her needs.  Those closest to the student with 
special needs -- parents and teachers -- should have authority to 
shape policy so it will be appropriate for that student.

<p>

Just as the U.S. Department of Education is poorly suited to the 
task of setting special education policies, it is poorly suited 
to the task of protecting the civil rights of students.

<p>

Civil rights issues in schools today are not significantly different 
from those in any other arena of American life.  To guarantee 
students equal protection under the law, the function of preserving 
civil rights in schools should be moved to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Schools have broken the chains of discrimination, and minority students 
have made considerable progress as a result.  Indeed, one of the few 
success stories in American education in the last three decades is the 
reduced disparity in the relative achievement and graduation rates of 
white and minority students.[28]

<p>

In dealing with schools, the Justice Department must heed the advice 
given in 1981 to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the Education 
Department:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The civil rights of individuals are fundamental, and should not be 
abridged.  But the role of the OCR...needs to be narrowed so as to 
allow state and local education officials to develop programs which 
will take into consideration the unique situations of particular 
schools and school districts.  Guidance and assistance, not broad, 
heavy-handed mandates and regulations, should be the role of this 
division.</i>[29]

</blockquote>

<p>

<center><h3>Private Solutions</h3></center>

<p>

The federal lending program for post-secondary education should be 
privatized.  Government should concentrate its limited funds on 
"inherently governmental functions," insists Robert Poole, president 
of the Reason Foundation.   "It should separate policymaking and 
regulation from actual service delivery."[30]

<p>

The federal government entered the educational lending business in 
1972 when it chartered the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie 
Mae) to ensure access to student loans for post-secondary education. 
Many argue that Sallie Mae has accomplished that mission and should 
now be privatized.[31] The Clinton Administration appears eager to 
let the quasi-private Sallie Mae do just that so that it may conduct 
a lending program with the exact opposite character: direct lending 
by the federal government.

<p>

Instituted in 1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program "has done 
nothing to 'reduce the complexity of administering student loans, 
eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to students 
and schools'" as it claimed it would, according to Allyson Tucker of 
the Heritage Foundation.[32]

<p>

Robert Poole calls privatization "a major worldwide trend,"[33] yet our 
government has chosen to espouse the failed economic philosophy that 
government industries are preferable to private ones.  Bankers are 
doubtful that direct lending will succeed.[34] With the Education 
Department's history of students defaulting on loans, their pessimism 
is not unfounded.  The federal government should get out of the lending 
business; it should also get out of the educational research business.[35]

<p>

The federal government need not be involved for national educational 
research to take place.  Indeed, the most commonly cited measurement 
of student performance -- the Standard Achievement Test (SAT) -- comes 
not from the federal government but from the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) in Princeton, NJ.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Bureaucracies are what bureaucracies do. Goals 2000 and the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act clearly show the intent of the federal 
Education Department to intrude further into local schools and usurp 
community responsibility. The history standards that the Department 
financed are so biased that the United States Senate renounced them 
in a 99 to 1 vote.

If there is one lesson of our times it is that centralization and huge 
bureaucracies don't work very well.  That truth swept away the 
governments of the Soviet Union and half a dozen other countries. 
People in all corners of the globe are moving to take control of their 
own lives back from distant bureaucracies.  Our own nation needs a 
renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so 
highly in 1835:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and 
efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants 
of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity 
or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and 
the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in 
the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power 
which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence 
checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</i>[36]

</blockquote>

<p>

It's time to disestablish the U.S. Education Department and end 
the federal intrusion into America's schools.

<title>ON DRUGS: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS SURRENDER</title>

<h1>On Drugs</h1>
<h2><i>The Clinton Administration's Curious Surrender</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>rug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly 
in recent years.  A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) found that between 1991 and 1994 annual marijuana use rose
from 6.2 percent to 13.0 percent among 8th graders, from 16.5 percent to 
30.4 percent among 10th	graders, and from 36.7 percent to 38.2 percent 
among 12th graders. Moreover, cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among 
teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.[1]

<p>

Despite these trends, the Clinton Administration is leading an all-out 
retreat in the drug war. During the past two years, President Clinton 
has overseen the wholesale dismantling of government agencies that are at 
least partly responsible for the successes of the 1980s. The Clinton 
Administration has:

<p><ul>

<li>Dropped the drug war as one of the National Security Council's top 
priorities. It is now number 29 of 29.[2]

<p>

<li>Cut the drug czar's office by 80 percent from 146 to 25 personnel. 
It was partially restored by Congressional mandate.[3]

<p>

<li>Folded the State Department's Office of International Narcotics 
Matters into a potpourri organization that handles issues like labor, 
environment and population concerns.[4]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Left two key anti-drug positions vacant for at least six months: the 
drug czar and the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support.[5]

<p>

<li>Cut military anti-drug efforts by signing an executive order 
drastically reducing the Pentagon's interdiction efforts. These cuts 
included 1,000 military positions devoted to anti-drug activities,[6] a 
move Rep. Charles Schumer (D-NY) called "a terrible mistake."[7]

<p>
	
<li>Cut drug interdiction funds for the Customs Service and the DEA. 
Today,	even though 70 percent of all cocaine comes to the U.S. via Mexico, 
the Customs Service does not routinely search for drugs inside semi-trailers 
crossing the border.[8]

<p>

<li>Reduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers.[9]

<p>

<li>Recommended, during his first-year budget, cuts in drug education 
(26 percent) and enforcement (15 percent).[10] Drug Czar Lee Brown learned 
of the proposed	cuts from an article in a newspaper.[11]

<p>

<li>Recommended merging the DEA with the FBI as part of the National 
Performance Review.[12]

<p>

<li>Cut 355 DEA agents and 102 personnel from the Justice Department's 
organized crime drug enforcement task force.[13]

<p>

<li>Cut the Coast Guard's drug interdiction budget by $14.6 million.[14]

<p>

<li>Terminated the DEA's drug kingpin program, which tracks international 
drug lords with the intent of bringing them to justice.

<p>

<li>Published a	report endorsing needle exchange programs intended to 
reduce the spread of AIDS and encouraged local governments to begin needle 
exchange programs.

police. International drug smuggling, the intended target of the DEA, has 
not abated.[15]

<p>

<li>Cut drug treatment and prevention budgets by $100 and $130 million 
respectively.[16]

<p>

<li>Disbanded Operation Snow-Cap, which assigned DEA agents to assist 
anti-drug police in cocaine-producing nations.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Bearing Responsibility</h3></center>

<p>

While it is certainly appropriate for policymakers to make changes that 
will improve the effectiveness of legitimate government programs (and these 
changes	will sometimes take the form of budget cuts, departmental 
consolidation and new priorities) a growing number of experts believe the 
Clinton Administration's drug policy changes are at least partly responsible 
for the recent increase in youth drug use and addiction.  For example, former 
First Lady Nancy Reagan told a Congressional committee in March 1995, "Why is 
it we no longer hear the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from 
our leaders and our culture?  Is it any	wonder drug use has started climbing 
and dramatically so?"[17]

<p>

Former drug czar William Bennett stated, there is "no viable effort by the 
Clinton Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign 
supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real 
prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and 
shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S."[18]

<p>

Former Drug Enforcement Administration director Robert Bonner stated, "I 
believe	that there has been a near total absence of presidential leadership 
by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal drug use in this 
country...It [the Administration] clearly fails to promote an increased 
awareness of the dangers of drug abuse, arguably encourages it...The 
Clinton	Administration's national drug strategy has failed miserably, and 
indeed it is a tragedy. The President must reverse this trend and start 
leading our nation's anti-drug efforts."[19]

<p>

Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) said, "I've been in Congress for over two 
decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president who cares 
less about this issue."[20]

<p>

Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's 
confirmation hearings, "Either the president is with you, or he has just 
given you a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are 
getting ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration...We 
might as well close [the drug office] down and stop the pretense."[21]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman Wayne Roques, a 25-year 
veteran of the drug war, states: "The drug culture, sensing a weakening 
in our national resolve, has reared its ugly head and embarked on a 
well-financed, unconscionable campaign to legalize drugs."[22]

<p>

Attorney General Janet Reno has heard enough of the criticism of the 
Clinton anti-drug efforts.  She stated, "I would just suggest that it 
has come time to stop the political labeling of this fight and all of us 
join together in one common-sense, concentrated	effort that goes after 
the traffickers, that goes after the violence spawned by the drugs but 
provides education, prevention and treatment in a way that can truly make 
a difference."[23]

<p>

The nation's chief law enforcement officer makes a good point, but the 
Clinton Administration's actions send a very different message.  They 
represent a major philosophical shift from the Reagan/Bush years.

<p>

Presidential candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National 
Convention in July 1992, "[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war on 
crime and drugs, I will."[24] He promised to combine tough law 
enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.  He also 
pledged to appoint a strong drug czar.[25]

<p>

Clinton's longstanding commitment to drug treatment is evidenced in his 
1995 National Drug Strategy.  He states: "The National Drug Control 
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's 
continuing drug problem...This strategy gives those who	have fallen 
prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior."  His strategy 
focuses on treatment.[26]

<p>
	
The President told <I>Rolling Stone</I> reporters that drug treatment 
is "a big issue."[27] He explained his intent to "change the focus of 
interdiction to work on the roots of the exports to the United States" 
and "we decided to go ahead and put drug treatment into the 
health-care bill."[28]

<p>

Former drug czar Bennett points out that a successful war on drugs must	
balance treatment with prevention and interdiction.  The Clinton strategy 
is unbalanced.

<p>

<center><h3>Some Curious Appointees</h3></center>

<p>

Clinton appointees have orchestrated a campaign to liberalize the 
government's war on drugs.

<p>

For example, Clinton's first Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders created a 
firestorm when she responded to a question at a National Press Club 
luncheon by stating, "I do feel	that we would markedly reduce our crime 
rate if drugs were legalized."[29]

<p>

Her comments evoked reactions from many sectors. Senator Bob Dole 
(R-KS) said, "Americans must be wondering if the Surgeon General 
is hazardous to our health."[30] But Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke 
applauded Elders: "I think what the Surgeon General said was 
absolutely courageous and correct; there should be a study."[31]

<p>

While President Clinton sought to distance himself from Elders' 
comments, the Clinton Justice Department issued a study recommending 
reduction in mandatory minimum drug sentences.[32]

<p>

The DOJ's report, "An Analysis of Non-Violent Drug Offenders with 
Minimal	Criminal Histories,"[33] found that low-level drug law 
violators are much less likely to commit another crime than high-level 
defendants and that sentence length had no effect on recidivism	rates. 
The study recommends that the money spent on jailing low-level drug 
offenders could be better spent on other criminal justice needs such as 
more police.  

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Justice Department<br>
issued a study recommending<br>
reduction in mandatory minimum<br>
sentences.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the study has a number of problems. A "significant number" (43 
percent) of the 16,316 federal inmates in this study were non-citizens 
with unknown criminal histories.  This fact should have eliminated these 
inmates from the study.[34] In addition, the study failed to consider 
the impact that incarcerating low-level	drug sellers has on the illicit 
drug market.  Incarcerating convicted drug dealers sends a clear message 
-- drug trafficking has a price.  No one knows how many potential 
traffickers consider the price and turn to alternative employment.

<p>

Not only did the Clinton Administration call for drug legalization, 
but it also issued a 1993 report advocating needle-exchange programs 
even though these programs fail.  Before joining the Clinton 
Administration, Dr. Philip Lee was the principal investigator for a 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in September 
1993 which analyzed 37 needle-exchange programs.[35] The report, "The 
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States 
and Abroad," concluded[36] that "needle exchanges neither increase 
nor decrease levels of inject[able] drug use,"[37] and stated that 
"studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV infection 
rates do not...and probably cannot provide clear evidence that 
needle exchange programs decrease HIV infection rates."[38]

<p>

Despite these findings, the report recommends:

<p><ul>

<li>"[T]he U.S. government should repeal the ban on federal funding 
of needle exchanges."

<p>

<li>States should repeal their prescription and/or paraphernalia laws 
banning possession of needles.

<p>

<li>Local communities should encourage the wider availability of 
sterile needles by allowing pharmacists to sell or exchange them.

</ul><p>

The Clinton Administration has encouraged needle-exchange programs, 
alleging that they will slow the advance of the virus that causes AIDS. 
Such programs, however, are not effective.

<p>

The much-publicized "Needle Park" (Platzspitz) experiment in Zurich, 
Switzerland was canceled after Swiss authorities concluded that	
needle exchanges promote crime, AIDS, drug abuse, and prostitution. 
After authorities closed the park, drug dealers and addicts moved the 
drug market to a formerly scenic bridge (named Lettensteg). The 
bridge was soon littered with thousands of discarded and probably 
contaminated needles and syringes. In February 1995, Swiss police 
fought a series of fierce gun battles to terminate Lettensteg's drug 
culture operation.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A government-sponsored needle exchange program in New York City has 
met a similar fate. "Ever since the lower east side Harm Reduction 
Center, a needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront 
in a residential population of working poor, our community has 
witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point cleared 
the area of drugs in the 1980s," one resident observed. "You can 
receive your government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit 
to the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell your 
clean needles), buy cocaine in storefronts or heroin on any corner, 
then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty syringes, glassine bags, 
alcohol swabs and bottle caps....Statistics on the spread of AIDS 
cannot be the only criteria for measuring the success of the 
program."[39]

<p>

<center><h3>Interdiction Failures</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration has also failed to sustain an effective 
international drug suppression effort.

<p>

Brian Sheridan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support, told a House Committee in October 
1994 that the Pentagon recommended $135 million in counterdrug 
budget cuts.[40] The Pentagon has also cut at least 1,000 military 
personnel from drug interdiction programs and has terminated 24 
programs because of "insufficient utility."[41] Sheridan explained, 
"We must recognize that illicit drug use is a deep-seated social 
problem which, like the problems of crime and inner-city poverty, 
will have to be addressed by all Americans over the long-term."[42]
	
<p>

An equal threat is posed by drug lords in South America. The 
Colombia-based Cali cartel is a cocaine distribution network which 
includes a corporate headquarters and franchises throughout the United 
States.  It has effectively overwhelmed the Customs Service, Coast 
Guard and the DEA. It employs sophisticated production,	transportation 
and marketing efforts.  Some laboratories are the size of industrial 
factories, operating with the unofficial endorsement of host 
governments. There are ten entry point/distribution hubs in the U.S. 
The Cali kingpins or their operations chiefs oversee regional directors, 
who in turn supervise regional "cells."  And the cocaine comes to 
American shores	through contract carriers via air, land and sea.  They 
employ cargo jets, large tractor trailers which are seldom inspected 
at the Mexican border, and ships filled to the brim with tons of 
cocaine.  For example, a 14-ton shipment of cocaine was found hidden 
inside concrete fence posts and bound for Longview, Texas via Miami.[43]

<p>

DEA director Thomas Constantine told the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Crime, "[O]ur crime situation is controlled by foreign criminals. 
Marketing decisions made in Cali, Colombia or the highlands of the 
Golden Triangle have a direct impact on the drug trade in the 
streets of New York or the waterfront of Miami.  Highly organized, 
technologically-advanced criminal groups have come to dominate the 
production and distribution of heroin and cocaine destined for the 
U.S."[44]

<p>

Although Clinton's DEA chief, Thomas Constantine, pledged at his 
confirmation hearing to promote "the most effective [anti-drug] 
enforcement possible under the rule of law,"  Senator Orrin Hatch 
(R-UT) cautioned, "Some people are concerned there's a different 
attitude down there [at the White House] to legalize drugs."[45]
	
<p>

During Constantine's watch, the DEA has experienced serious personnel 
and budget cuts. He shut down operations for three weeks in early 
1995 to reorganize.  Constantine has also canceled Operation Snow-Cap, 
which had slowed the production and shipment of cocaine in the source 
countries. He has discontinued the TKO kingpin operation, which 
tracked drug lords and brought them to justice.  And now he has 
directed DEA agents to turn away from overseas and focus on the 
grass-roots level, helping police departments with street-level 
suppression.  The mobile enforcement team (MET)	program places teams 
of DEA agents in communities to assist police departments.[46]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Administration<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

These radical changes jeopardize the U.S.'s international interdiction 
effort and severely threaten the morale of an organization that has 
long defended our borders.  FBI director Louis Freeh told a House 
Committee on March 30, 1995, "If law enforcement is to stem or even 
slow the flood of drugs into this country, we must have a strong and 
effective presence overseas."[47]

<p>

To add insult to injury, DEA agents are subjected to Justice 
Department briefings that show how to properly use syringes to 
inject illicit drugs.  This training is part of the Clinton 
Administration's mandatory AIDS awareness training for federal 
employees.

<p>

Mr. Clinton promised to hire a strong drug czar. In April 1993, 
Clinton elevated the drug czar to the cabinet level, explaining, "I 
believe drug abuse is as serious a problem as we have in America."[48] 
Then he slashed the czar's staff 80 percent.

<p>

Clinton spokeswoman Alice Rivlin, deputy director of OMB, told a 
Congressional budget hearing, "It is not that drug policy is less 
important...On the contrary it is more important...The problem has 
been a lack of leadership, not the size of the staff."[49]

<p>

Selecting Brown does not match the President's promise to hire "a 
strong drug czar" or seek the right "leader."  Brown, a former New 
York police commissioner, left that post under the shadow of the 
Crown Heights riot.

<p>

After becoming drug czar, Brown was excluded from the White House 
communication loop.  In July 1993, White House budget officials 
accepted a major cut in anti-drug programs without consulting Brown. 
He didn't know about the arrangement until he read it in <i>The 
Washington Post</i>.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Bad Company</h3></center>

<p>

President Clinton has surrounded himself with many counselors, but 
their wisdom with regard to drug issues deserves scrutiny.

<p>

Consider some Clinton advisors and their views on drugs:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Minister.</i></b> On Sunday, April 10, 1994	the 
Clintons were at church like millions of other Americans.  That morning 
their regular pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry 
United Methodist Church, said he believed the government could create 
"a safer environment for all of us" if now-illegal drugs were legalized. 
He later explained, "I happen to have the belief that one of the things 
that we need to re-examine in our current society is the...legalization 
of some drugs.  And my belief is that if the economic portions could be 
cut out of the cocaine and heroin traffic, it might be possible to make 
a safer	environment for all of us."[51]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's College Mentor.</i></b> Not only are some of Mr. 
Clinton's spiritual advisors sympathetic to legalization but so are 
some of his former academic mentors.  His former Yale law professor, 
Steven Duke, co-author of a 1993 book <i>America's Longest War: 
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</i>, advocates legalizing 
cocaine, including crack, marijuana and heroin.[52]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Campaign Advisor.</i></b> Mathea Falco was 
recruited by the Clinton/Gore campaign to advise on drug policy 
issues. She is the president of Drug Strategy, a non-profit 
organization funded by pro-legalization billionaire George Soros, who 
gave Falco's organization a reported $2 million in 1994.[53] Drug 
Strategy is a drug policy think-tank that supports the legalization 
of marijuana.

<p>

During the mid-1970's, Falco was a special assistant to the president 
of the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. and testified in Congress on narcotics 
abuse favoring a "broad" reassessment of drug policy and the review 
of the feasibility of decriminalizing marijuana	and "possibly" cocaine. 
She subsequently served as an Assistant Secretary of State for 
international narcotics under President Carter.[54]

<p>

According to the pro-drug periodical <i>High Times</i>, Falco worked 
closely with Peter Bourne, President Carter's drug policy chief who 
fell from power after he was found to have snorted cocaine at a 
National Organization for the Reform of	Marijuana Laws (NORML) 
party.[55] The magazine told its March 1993 audience that Falco believes 
drug interdiction does not work and that she would support medical use 
of marijuana and needle	exchange.  She was thought to be a candidate 
for the drug czar's job.[56]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Advisors Reviewing DEA's Performance.</i></b> 
The Clinton Administration hired Mark Kleiman and Peter	Reuter to 
review the performance of the DEA.[57]

<p>

Kleiman is an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy 
School of Government and author of <i>Against Excess</i>, which includes 
an endorsement of marijuana legalization.[58] He was once a drug 
policy analyst for the Department of Justice and says that the 
primary goal of drug policy should be to limit the harms drug users 
do to themselves and the resulting harms to others.

<p>

According to <i>High Times</i>, Kleiman advocates user licenses 
for alcohol and pot and served as a graduate advisor for psychedelic 
researcher Rick	Doblin.[59] He spoke at a 1990 conference entitled 
"Regulation or Prohibition: Psychedelics in the	1990s."  In April 
1993, Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML stating, "The 
hardest, intellectually, the hardest problem, I think, facing American 
Drug Policy is how to make the psychedelics available for their 
beneficial uses to people who can get benefit from them without	
increasing use under dangerous conditions, and abuse."[60]

<p>

In October 1994, John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and 
Budget, Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's 
services. His organization, BOTEC, Inc., Carnevale said "has conducted 
a number of important studies over the past few years for ONDCP, 
especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin situation...At	
the current time, BOTEC's work, for whose timeliness and quality we have 
very high regard, continues to be the analysis of heroin use trends."[61] 
Kleiman is listed by Lee Brown as one of the many "expert individuals" 
to the drug czar for the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.[62]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's White House Staff.</i></b> All White House staff 
members require security clearances. Use of illegal drugs has long 
been a disqualification for a security clearance.

<p>

One of the first indications that drugs would be viewed differently 
by the Clinton Administration was the conduct of drug-testing for 
incoming presidential staff members.  The Clinton White House waived 
drug-testing until February 15, 1993 -- almost four weeks into the 
new administration.[63] By comparison, the Bush Administration 
required all new presidential aides to obtain negative test results 
before they could start work at the White House.[64]

<p>

The problem with staff drug testing continued for more than a year. 
In July 1994, then-press secretary Dee Dee Myers confirmed that one 
third of the White House staff still did not have "permanent 
passes."[65] This indicated a possible problem with drug-testing 
compliance. She admitted to being one of those without a pass, explaining 
she didn't have time to complete the paperwork.[66]

<p>

Director of White House Administration Patsy Thomasson oversees the 
security passes.  She once served at the right hand of an Arkansas 
investor, Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. Her 
past association with a drug felon compelled the Senate to vote 98-0 
in June 1994 to require the president to certify that Thomasson	has 
no history of drug abuse.[67]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

The suspicions about the White House staff linger. For example, the 
<i>Washington Times</i> reported in January 1995 that White House 
staffers have been seen	using drugs at parties around Washington. 
The paper quoted an unnamed source, "There's this private little 
social scene and everybody just assumes that no one's going to 
tattletale." Allegedly, one of the drug-using staff members works on 
the White House's National Security Council.[68]

<p>

Newt Gingrich ignited a firestorm on December 4, 1994 when he said, "I 
had a senior law enforcement official tell me that, in his judgment, 
up to a quarter of the White House Staff, when they first came in, 
had used drugs in the last four or five years...it's very clear that 
they had huge problems getting people through security clearances 
because they kept bringing people in who had a lot of things that 
weren't very easy to clear."[69]

<p>

White House Chief of Staff Leon	Panetta rebutted the allegation. "There 
is no one in the White House who uses drugs."  But according to 
the <i>Washington Times</i>, White House staffers who frequent the 
Oval Office were seen "passing around joints [marijuana cigarettes]" 
at a local party.[70]

<p>

An unnamed senior administration official said that Gingrich got 
the number right but the time period wrong.  He said that a quarter 
of the White House staff admitted to using illegal drugs at some point 
in the past, however, that's well below the national average of almost 
40 percent.  Miss Myers noted, "Only one employee has failed a random 
drug test and that employee was a career person in a non-policy	
role."[71]

<p>

As recently as March 27, 1995, Miss Thomasson told a Senate subcommittee 
that 11	White House staffers are in a special random drug-testing 
program because of concerns about "recent drug use."  She also 
acknowledged that volunteers without adequate security clearances have 
been given access to sensitive areas in the White House and added that 
92.2 percent of eligible staff members had received permanent entrance 
passes.[72]

<center><h3>Other Pro-Legalization Allies</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's retreat in the drug war has encouraged 
a wide range of pro-legalization advocates, including:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Ethan Nadelmann.</i></b> He heads a pro-drug organization, 
the Lindesmith Center, which is heavily funded by billionaire George 
Soros.[73] Soros is pushing the "harm reduction" agenda, which is 
widely viewed as a first step toward legalization.  Soros's goal "is 
to invigorate and support a broader debate on drug policy" and to shift 
from drug war to "drug peace."[74]

<p>

Nadelmann advances the notion that illegal drug use is a private issue 
and predicts that "in another five or ten years maybe the right over 
one's consciousness, the right to possess and consume drugs, may be 
as powerfully and as widely understood as the other rights of Americans	
are."[75]

<p>

Nadelmann told <i>Reason</i> magazine, "The replacement of the 
Bush Administration with the Clinton Administration was generally a 
good thing.  It brought in a lot of new blood, new thinking. Lee 
Brown is not what I would call a desirable drug czar, but he's no 
William Bennett, either. There's more room for consideration of 
alternatives."[76]

<p>

<li><b><i>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA).</i></b> Congressman Frank told 
a 1994 NORML conference, "I think we ought to make smoking marijuana 
legal."[77] He also told a Harvard Law School conference titled, 
"Crime, Drugs, Health and Prohibition," that the government spends 
too much money to stop drug trafficking.[78] He told a radio 
audience, "We should give the money to drug treatment and local 
cops."[79]

<p>

<li><b><i>Eric Sterling.</i></b> He serves as president of the 
nonprofit Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and is a former counsel 
to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime and principal aide in 
developing parts of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

<p>

He currently works with the Centers for Disease Control and the 
D.C. Commission on Public Health and has been honored by the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service. Sterling told a 1991 NORML conference, "Hi,	
I'm Eric Sterling and I'm a 15-year member of NORML and I'm really 
glad to be here to talk to so many of you...How many of you are 
stoned now?  Show of hands.  Honestly, how many of you are stoned 
now...about a quarter.  And I ask that question because I used to 
get stoned at NORML conferences	and it was my favorite, favorite 
times [sic] to get stoned."[80]

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
White House staffers have<br>
been seen using drugs at<br>
parties around Washington.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Mr. Sterling was a guest speaker at the 6th Annual Conference on 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities.  Some attendees called for his 
removal based on his open advocacy of drug use.

<p>

He continues to speak out for drug legalization. For example, he 
was a guest speaker at the 1993 Fifth Annual Hemp Freedom Rally in 
Massachusetts and spoke at a pro-pot rally in front of the White House 
on January 21, 1993.  He led the crowd in chanting "Inhale to the 
Chief."

<p>

<li><b><i>Organizations like the Drug Policy Foundation.</i></b> 
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson observed, "Groups like [the] 
Drug Policy Foundation are run by three-piece-suited guys, not dope 
smokers, and they say they don't support legalization, that they're 
just studying alternatives...But I think that's just to put a 
respectable front on what they are really doing, lobbying for 
legalization...I got hold of the agenda for one of their meetings, 
and it included discussions of money laundering and bank secrecy."[81]

<p>

The DPF	will award more than $1 million in grants to promote drug 
legalization programs. For example, in February 1995, DPF awarded 
$25,000 to Cannabis Action Network, which advocates marijuana use; 
$15,000 to NORML for National Medical Marijuana Day; and $3,000 to 
the National AIDS Brigade which	promotes needle exchange programs.[82]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's actions and its advisors' reputations 
suggest a general lack of commitment to the drug war.  With drug abuse 
on the rise, the President must lead the nation in an all-out effort 
to turn the tide of drugs away from our shores and especially away from 
our children.

<title>THE ONE-HOUSE SCHOOLROOM</title>

<body>

<h1>The One-House Schoolroom</h1>
<h2><i>The Extraordinary Influence of<br>
Family Life on Student Learning</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>S</font>he grew up during the depression in a small mill 
town in the South.  Her father was a textile worker.  Her mother, a 
homemaker. She not only became the first member of her family to go to 
college, but she also went on to get a graduate degree, to teach high 
school chemistry, and to be named Teacher of the Year.

<p>

So, when Lydia Lowie was asked several years ago to give a
speech describing the most influential teacher in her life, most
expected the retired schoolteacher to wax eloquent about an inspiring
high school science instructor or a brilliant college chemistry
professor.

<p>

Instead, Lowie talked about her mother.  That's right, this
highly-accomplished schoolteacher who had for years paid dues
to a teacher's union that boasts, &quot;If you can read this,
thank a teacher,&quot; identified as her most influential instructor
a poor, simple woman with a high school education.[1]

<p>

While some might be tempted to dismiss Lowie's comments as
sweetly sentimental, the truth is mothers -- and fathers -- exert
far more influence over their children's intellectual development
than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three decades of
research shows that families have greater influence over a child's
academic performance than any other factor -- including schools.

than any other factor -- including<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Yet, curiously, almost all public discussion about improving
education in this country centers around school-based reforms
of one kind or another.  Unless and until our education debate
begins to focus on the family, significantly improving student
performance in America is likely to remain an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Matters</h3></center>

<p>

Just as Jed Clampett once discovered &quot;buffalo crude&quot;
while shooting for some food, much of the early research measuring
the extraordinary influence of family life on student achievement
was uncovered somewhat by accident.

<p>

In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James
Coleman led a major research study designed to explain why students
in certain schools or in certain classes within a school perform
better, on average, than students attending other schools or other
classes.  Coleman's pioneering research weighed the relative influence
on student achievement of different school factors (such as per-pupil
spending and school size) as well as the influence of different
teacher variables (such as teacher experience and levels of education
completed).

<p>

While several school factors proved to have a modest effect
on student performance, they paled in comparison to the influence
of family background.  According to Coleman, there is a &quot;powerful
relation of the child's own family background characteristics
to his achievement, a relation stronger than that of any school
factors.&quot;[2]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
What families</i> do <i>really matters.<br>
Differences in student learning<br>
are not determined simply by the<br>
quality of one's gene pool or by<br>
which side of the tracks one lives<br>
on. Instead, differences in child<br>
learning stem significantly from the<br>
values, habits, and relational<br>
dynamics at work within the household.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Coleman's research spawned a number of studies replicating
his work and building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed
Coleman's chief finding that families exert considerable influence
over student achievement.  For example, a 1984 research review
by the National Institute of Education concluded, &quot;Extensive,
substantial, and convincing evidence suggests that parents play
a crucial role in both the home and school environments with respect
to facilitating the development of intelligence, achievement,
and competence in children.&quot;[3] A 1993 survey of the research
literature by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues reported, &quot;The
home environment is a most powerful factor in determining the
school learning of students -- their level of school achievement,
their interest in school learning, and the number of years of
schooling they will receive.[4] And a 1994 report issued by the
U.S. Department of Education noted, &quot;Thirty years of research
show that greater family involvement in children's learning is
a critical link to achieving a high-quality education ... controllable
home factors account for almost all the differences in average
student achievement.[5]

<p>

What is especially important about this body of research is
that it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really
matters.  That is, the research shows that differences in student
learning are not determined simply by the quality of one's gene
pool or by which side of the tracks one lives on.  Instead, differences
in child learning stem significantly from the values, habits and
relational dynamics at work within the household.

<p>

Indeed, a research review published in the <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I>
found that the home learning environment has an effect on achievement
that is at least twice as great as family social-economic status
(SES).[6] A Study commissioned by the Toronto Board of Education
found that parental encouragement at home and participation in
school activities have a more significant effect on children's
achievement than either SES or student ability.[7] And Bloom and
his colleagues summarize their findings by observing, &quot;Parents
from a variety of cultural backgrounds and with different levels
of education, income or occupational status can and do provide
stimulating home environments that support and encourage the learning
of their children.  It is what parents do in the home rather than
their status that is important.[8]

<p>

<center><h3>A Stimulating Home Environment</h3></center>

<p>

What characterizes the home learning environment in which children
are most likely to succeed?  In a 1994 review of the research
literature,[9] Anne Henderson and Nancy Berla of the National Committee
for Citizens in Education reported that children fare best when
their parents:

<p><ul>

<li>establish a daily family routine (including regular bedtimes
and times to study);

<p>

<li>monitor out-of-school activities (particularly television
viewing);

<p>

<li>model the value of learning, self-discipline and hard work
(especially through use of newspapers, encyclopedias, and other
home educational tools);

<p>

<li>express high but realistic expectations for achievement (and
reward success with special recognition);

<p>

<li>encourage children's development and progress in school (by
helping with homework, maintaining dialogue with teachers, and
the like);

<p>

<li>stimulate reading, writing, and discussions among family members
(including mealtime discussions, bedtime stories, and letters
to relatives); and

<p>

<li>facilitate use of community resources (such as libraries,
museums, sports programs, music lessons, and cultural events).

</ul><p>

That these &quot;home&quot; variables contribute to children's
learning should not surprise anyone.  What may surprise many,
however, is just how much difference &quot;home&quot; factors
can make.

<p>

Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might
consider this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies
have found the frequency of family meals together to be a strong
predictor of student test scores.[10] In explaining this high positive
correlation,  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent
mealtimes give parents regular opportunities to ask questions
about what kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give parents
regular opportunities to broaden children's educational horizons.
For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public affairs
is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime discussions 
his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.

<p>

Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a far more profound effect on student achievement than is commonly 
realized. In his groundbreaking book, <I>School's Out</I>, Lewis 
Perelman of the Discovery Institute reports that data from the High 
School and Beyond Survey show that the number of learning tools 
available in the home is a much stronger predictor of academic 
achievement than factors such as whether parents expect 
children to attend college.[11] Moreover, Perelman argues that 
a much-publicized 1990 book by Terry Moe and John Chubb of 
the Brookings Institute underestimates the influence
of family factors on student achievement because it overlooks
data showing an extremely high correlation between schools with
high achievers and students who have an above average number of
learning tools in the home.[12]

<p>

Other studies also have found a high correlation between home
learning tools and student achievement.  For example, a report
issued by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory shows that apart
from fixed characteristics like family size and SES, student achievement
is influenced by variables like having books available, reading
to children, taking trips, and guiding TV watching.[13] A study of
third graders in southern California indicates that high achievers
are more likely than other students to spend time on homework,
to use the dictionary, and to take part in learning activities
with their parents.[14] And education analyst Ann Milne concludes
from her review of more than 100 studies, &quot;What is important
is the ability of the parent(s) to provide pro-educational resources
for their children -- be they financial, material, or experiential.&quot;[15]

<p>

Not surprisingly, the positive impact of home learning tools
is especially high when these materials are used in direct parent-child
interaction.  For example, a 1985 report from the National Academy
of Education found that the single most important activity for
building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading
is reading aloud to children.[16] Moreover, a 1992 study at the City
University of New York found that average IQ scores of low-income
preschoolers are boosted by nearly seven percentage points for
each day of the week that a mother reads to her child.[17]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also
be seen in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time
day care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in
language development.  What is the primary reason for the difference?
Young children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.[18]

<p>

<center><h3>Structure Counts, Too</h3></center>

<p>

To say that family practices and processes make a significant
contribution to child learning does not imply that &quot;non-process&quot;
family factors (such as family income, size, structure, genetic
make-up, and parents' education) are somehow unimportant.  Indeed,
Milne reports that research consistently shows &quot;that both
males and females from single-parent families performed less well
than those from two-parent families.&quot;[19] A University of California
study shows that &quot;parent inputs do reduce the proportion
of low achievers, but they do not overcome the disadvantages of
low income.&quot;[20] Studies of twins suggest that genetic factors
account for at least one-third to one-half of the differences
in IQ scores.[21] And a study of Los Angeles elementary school students
finds that &quot;home process variables, parental responsibility
variables, and family background circumstances <I>worked together</I>
to shape student achievement patterns (emphasis added).&quot;[22]

<p>

These and other studies indicate that certain family structures
and backgrounds facilitate child learning more than others.  And
they suggest that the combined effect on student achievement of
&quot;process&quot; and &quot;non-process&quot; variables is most
apparent when either both sets of factors naturally pull in the
same direction (when, for example, highly-educated parents make
time to teach their children things at home) or when family roles
are adapted to facilitate home learning.

<p>

Consider, for example, the effect of family size on child learning.
For many years, researchers have reported that a child's learning
potential is threatened by the addition of new siblings to a household.
This notion that &quot;smaller families are better&quot; springs
from the fact that, in most American households, children are
primarily educational &quot;consumers&quot; taking from their
parents' learning resources, rather than significant &quot;producers&quot;
contributing to the family's overall learning environment.  When
children are given opportunities to contribute meaningfully to
the home learning environment, however, the negative effect of
increased family size can be eliminated  -- if not turned into
a positive.

<p>

That, at least, is one of the most important findings of a
fascinating 1992 University of Michigan study about the children
of Southeast Asian &quot;boat people&quot; who came to America
during the late 1970s and early 1980s.[23] This study found that
the refugee children's remarkable educational achievement (their
average scores were well above average in math and science, and
only slightly below average in reading and English) was due in
no small part to an effect similar to that found in the old one-room
schoolhouse.  Here's how the study's authors describe a typical
evening in a refugee home:  &quot;After dinner, the table is cleared,
and homework begins.  The older children, both male and female,
help their younger siblings.  Indeed, they seem to learn as much
from teaching as from being taught . . . [A] great amount of learning
goes on at these times -- in terms of skills, habits, attitudes,
and expectations as well as the content of a subject . . . Such
sibling involvement demonstrates how a large family can encourage
and enhance academic success.&quot;

<p>

Not only does this study of Indochinese refugee families challenge
prevailing assumptions about the educational impact of larger
family size, but it also challenges prevailing assumptions about
whether poorly-educated parents can contribute significantly to
their children's cognitive development.  Even though the refugee
parents had very limited English skills, they still enhanced their
children's literacy by reading to them.  In fact, &quot;the effects
of being read to held up statistically whether the children were
read to in English or in their native language,&quot; the University
of Michigan research team report.  &quot;This finding suggests
that parental English literacy skills may not play a vital role
in determining school performance.  Rather, other aspects of the
experience -- emotional ties between parent and child, cultural
validation and wisdom shared in stories read in the child's native
language, or value placed on reading and learning -- extend to
schoolwork.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Policy Implications</h3></center>

<p>

Just as it is important for families to appreciate the magnitude
of their influence over child learning, it is also important for
education officials to design policies and programs that envision
parents playing a major role in their children's cognitive and
moral development.

<p>

Unfortunately, this occurs far too infrequently -- in part
because education officials have far less control over family
structures and processes (thankfully!) than over school policies
and procedures.

<p>

Yet, if hopes for reversing America's education decline are
to be realized, serious attention must be given to the role of
families in improving student performance.  As Bloom and his colleagues
acknowledge, &quot;It seems most unlikely that a significant improvement
in the quality of education for all students can be achieved without
active support from other quarters . . . particularly families.&quot;[24]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The number and variety of<br>
learning tools (books, tapes,<br>
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers<br>
and the like) in the home have<br>
a far more profound effect on<br>
student achievement than is<br>
commonly realized.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To that end, three reforms are especially needed:

<p>

<b><i>1. Redefine &quot;parental involvement&quot; to give emphasis
to the role parents play as their children's first and most important
teachers.</i></b> While virtually everyone these days supports greater
&quot;parental involvement&quot; in education, few Americans --
including many parents themselves -- really believe it is critical.
If educating children is a pot luck dinner, then most Americans
perceive that schools provide the &quot;meat and potatoes,&quot;
while families contribute the dessert.

<p>

This analogy can almost be taken literally.  In many places
today, &quot;parental involvement&quot; is defined to include
little more than making brownies for school bake sales, being
room mothers for class parties, volunteering to chaperone school
field trips, serving on school advisory committees, and attending
open houses, PTA meetings, sporting events, plays, and musical
performances.

<p>

While no one would dispute the legitimacy of some -- if not
all -- of these functions, it is instructive that most of these
traditional parental functions do not center around learning.
Indeed, traditional definitions of &quot;parental involvement&quot;
do not fully appreciate the instructional contribution parents
can and should make to their children's cognitive development.

<p>

This is unfortunate, for the instructional role of parents
is not only very important, but is often more appealing to families
than other forms of involvement.  &quot;What appears to be a crucial
role for black parents is their role as teachers in the home,&quot;
notes Jacqueline Jordan Irvine in her book, <I>Black Students
and School Failure</I>.  &quot;It is the role that parents prefer
and the one directly related to the achievement of their children.&quot;[25]

<p>

In fact, Irvine believes part of the reason many parents are
apathetic about serving on advisory boards and in other traditional
capacities is because they perceive that their roles on such committees
are &quot;marginal&quot; and that their participation has little
or no direct impact on the achievement of their children.

<p>

These observations are echoed in a study of nearly 5,000 elementary 
school parents by researchers Steven Melnick and Richard Fiene.
In a paper presented to the American Education Research Association,
Melnick and Fiene report that &quot;parents did not want to be
part of a 'professional-client' relationship with the school or
to be patronized in any way.&quot;[26]

<p>

&quot;Parents belong at the center of a young child's education,&quot;
says former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett.  &quot;The
single best way to improve elementary education is to strengthen
parents' role in it.&quot;[27]

<p>

<b><i>2. Refocus &quot;educational choice&quot; to give emphasis
to the way in which it increases parental involvement in education.</i></b>
Currently, the case for giving parents &quot;school choice&quot;
often emphasizes ways schools would improve in a competitive free
market environment.  If parents easily could move their children
from one school to another, the argument goes, then schools would
work harder to educate students, thereby raising the quality of
all schools.

<p>

There is nothing wrong with this argument.  Competition would
improve schools.  That is a bedrock free market principle.

<p>

But this is not the only (or even the most) compelling argument
for adopting an educational choice plan.  Just as a break-up of
the government school monopoly is apt to affect supply-side behavior
and give us better schools, it is also apt to affect demand-side
behavior and give us better families. If genuine &quot;educational
choice&quot; existed, parents would be active, discriminating
consumers of various educational options rather than passive recipients
of schooling chosen by government planners using proximity-is-destiny
guidelines.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This research argues for<br>
policies which facilitate<br>
greater parental involvement<br>
in children's lives -- not<br>
year-round, all-day, cradle-<br>
to-college school programs<br>
that leave little time for<br>
families to learn together.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Indeed, no longer would parents enjoy the privilege of blaming
the government for supplying bad schools.  With parental choice
comes parental responsibility.  Ultimately, parents would be responsible
for the decisions they make -- whether those decisions produced
positive outcomes or negative ones.

<p>

In such an environment, parents undoubtedly would devote greater
time and attention to considering ways to improve their children's
academic outcomes.  They would carefully weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of different educational options -- and carefully
monitor the outcomes of various educational decisions.

<p>

And so long as the resources with which they have to work are
fungible, parents would be empowered to consider and pursue all
sorts of learning strategies that might benefit their children
-- including some that lie outside the realm of conventional schooling.

<p>

<b><i>3. Replace the existing model of education, which is heavily
based upon late-19th Century norms, with a new model designed
to seize 21st Century opportunities.</i></b> Several months before
issuing its much-publicized 1994 report on parental involvement,
the U.S. Department of Education issued a separate report that
said America's schoolchildren are &quot;prisoners&quot; of an
outmoded school schedule.[28] Specifically, the report said that
the typical nine-month school calendar (which was originally built
around the annual agricultural schedule) hinders learning continuity
and requires teachers to do considerable review after summer breaks.
The report also said the average school day ends before teachers
have adequate opportunity to cover all the subjects contemporary
schools seek to address -- and before many employed parents arrive
home from work.

<p>

Based on these observations, the report called for lengthening
the school day and the school year.  It also called for expanding
early childhood programs directed at preschoolers, in the name
of improving school readiness.

<p>

While at first blush these ideas may appear eminently reasonable,
their collective thrust towards more schooling fails to appreciate
the fact that data from the National Center for Education Statistics
show that U.S. students already rack up more &quot;seat&quot;
time in school each year than their counterparts in Japan, Germany,
England, Italy, Canada, and Korea. (Compared to others, however,
time in U.S. schools is more likely to be devoted to non-academic
pursuits like gym, driver's education, counseling, and assemblies.)[29]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The result would be customized<br>
learning programs tailored to<br>
the unique needs of each child,<br>
with many part-time schooling<br>
options between the current<br>
polar opposites of 100 percent<br>
home schooling and 100 percent<br>
conventional schooling.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

More importantly, the drive for more schooling seems to be
at odds with the growing volume of research data showing how critically
important parental involvement is to children's learning.   Indeed,
this research argues for policies which facilitate greater parental
involvement in children's lives -- not year-round, all-day, cradle-to-college
school programs that leave little time for families to learn together.

<p>

Moreover, the most interesting educational trend in America
today -- the growth in home schooling -- is being driven both
by a frustration with rationalized, factory-style, morally-neutral
schooling and by a desire on the part of many parents to be highly
involved in the moral and cognitive development of their children.
What is especially interesting about this trend is the degree
to which some public school teachers have embraced it.

<p>

&quot;Family is the main engine of education,&quot; observed
junior high teacher John Taylor Gatto in a speech commemorating
his selection as New York City's Teacher of the Year. &quot;If
we use schooling to break children away from parents -- and make
no mistake, that has been the central function of schools since
John Cotton announced it as the purpose of the Bay Colony schools
in 1650 and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts
schools in 1850 -- we're going to continue to have the horror
show we have right now.&quot;[30]

<p>

Gatto finds it &quot;curious&quot; that the literacy rate in
Massachusetts prior to compulsory attendance laws was 98 percent
-- seven percentage points higher than it has been at any point
since.  And he finds it &quot;curious&quot; that home-schooled
students score significantly better than their conventionally-schooled
peers on achievement tests.  Indeed, a 1990 study of more than
1,500 randomly-selected home-schooling families found that home-educated
students score, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in
all areas of standardized achievement tests.[31]

<p>

While conceding that we won't &quot;get rid of schools anytime
soon,&quot; Gatto says greater attention needs to be given to
facilitating learning opportunities that bring parents and children
together.  &quot;The curriculum of family is at the heart of any
good life,&quot; says Gatto.  &quot;The way to sanity in education
is for our schools to take the lead in releasing the stranglehold
of institutions on family life.&quot;[32]

<p>

Similarly, Seattle public school teacher David Guterson says
&quot;the notion of parents as educators of their children is,
in the broad sense, neither extreme nor outlandish.&quot;  Indeed,
Guterson points out that &quot;homeschooled children learn under
the ideal conditions that schoolteachers persistently cry out
for.&quot;[33]

<p>

In a compelling essay for <I>Harper's</I> magazine, Guterson
writes, &quot;Today it is considered natural for parents to leave
their children's education entirely in the hands of institutions.
In a better world, we [parents] would see <I>ourselves</I> as
responsible and our schools primarily as resources.  Schools would
cease to be <I>places</I> in the sense that prisons and hospitals
are places; instead education would be embedded in the life of
the community . . . Parents would measure their inclinations and
abilities and immerse themselves, to varying degrees and in varying
ways, in a larger educational system designed to <i>assist</i> them.
Schools -- educational resource centers -- would provide materials,
technology, and expertise instead of classrooms, babysitters,
and bureaucrats.&quot;

<p>

Guterson's vision of schools as interactive &quot;educational
resource centers&quot; is shared by Lewis Perelman, a former high
school physics teacher in New York state.  Indeed, Perelman believes
the era of conventional classroom-style schooling is coming to
a close, giving way to a variety of &quot;hyperlearning&quot;
strategies better suited to the computer-driven, information age
in which we now live.[34]

<p>

For families to be able to take full advantage of emerging
learning opportunities, Perelman believes school choice -- a one
time decision at the beginning of the school year -- will not
be enough.  Instead, he says parents will want and need to make
educational &quot;choices&quot; on an ongoing basis, much as they
do currently in other realms of economic activity.

<p>

Obviously, different families would answer education questions
differently, just as different families currently answer transportation
questions differently.  Some would lean heavily on do-it-yourself
strategies (driving oneself, teaching one's own), others would
depend heavily on outside services (taking the bus, enrolling
in classes).  But this model of education would be highly flexible
and adaptable.  Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all public
school monopoly, this new model would accommodate the different
needs and interests of different families.
<p>

The result would be &quot;customized&quot; learning programs
tailored to the unique needs of each child, with many &quot;part-time&quot;
schooling options between the current polar opposites of 100 percent
homeschooling and 100 percent conventional schooling.

<p>

<center><h3>Reviving Tuition Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Quite appropriately, this new model would make parents the
principal educational decision-makers.  This doesn't mean that
parents would be experts in every educational subject any more
than consumers of microwave ovens are experts in microwave technology.
It simply means parents would be primarily responsible for the
moral and cognitive development of their 6-18 year-olds, just
as they currently are primarily responsible for the moral and
cognitive development of their children under the age of six.

<p>

And it means education policy-makers increasingly would need
to replace direct funding of schools with tax credits that empower
parents.  Tax credits are superior to vouchers as a means of empowering
families for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that
tax credits are more fungible.  Indeed, one of the reasons college
tuition expenses have increased at such a rapid rate in recent
years is because so many students partially or completely pay
for their higher education with non-fungible grants, loans, or
scholarships. Since college officials know that student aid
cannot be used for any other purpose, they have an easier time
increasing tuition expenses than would be the case if a larger
share of tuition expenses were being paid with cash that could
be used for other purposes.

<p>

How might a fungible educational tax credit initially be structured?
Perhaps the best plan would be modeled after the federal tax
code's current treatment of tax deductions. That is, the federal 
government could offer a &quot;standard&quot; educational tax credit 
of say, $400 per-child to all parents who have school-aged children, 
and an &quot;itemized&quot; educational tax credit option of up to
say, $1,600 per child would be available to families that
incur significant educational expenses for which they have receipts.
This would give all parents a hassle-free means of investing
in their children's education by doing things like purchasing
home learning tools (books, puzzles, computer equipment, art supplies,
etc.), and paying tuition expenses (for conventional classroom
instruction and/or for special learning opportunities like dance
lessons or summer camp).

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
If educating children is a<br>
pot luck dinner, then most<br>
Americans perceive that schools<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Funding such a plan could come from the existing expenditures
made by the federal government for education-related programs.

<p>

State governments could offer similar programs, drawing upon
resources saved from lower enrollment in all-day public schools
and from other sources.

<p>

To be sure, these ideas would not be popular with teachers'
union leaders, federal education bureaucrats, and other parts
of the &quot;education blob&quot; as Bennett is fond of calling
it.  But folks like Keith Geiger (head of the National Education
Association) can't have it both ways.  If, as Gieger has argued,
&quot;the most effective and cost efficient place for children
to acquire the foundation for learning and moral values is in
the home,&quot;  then it stands to reason that solutions to America's
education problems ought to be primarily home-based, not school-based.[35]

<p>

Certainly, parental empowerment strategies would benefit children
coming from strong families.

<p>

But these strategies would also benefit children coming from
disadvantaged environments whose educational experiences would
become more &quot;customized&quot; as learning opportunities become
more varied and tailored to the individual.

<p>

To be sure, some children would still fall through the cracks.
But the grim reality of education in America today is that many,
many children are already falling through the cracks.  And many,
many more will do so in the future if we continue to focus our
education debate on schools instead of families.

<p>

&quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools
[and] ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed
to fail,&quot;  Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that
schools will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;[36]

<p>

Only families can. Only families will.

<p>

That is the lesson Guterson believes Americans need to learn.
If indeed we learn it, this time we really should thank a teacher.

<title>BEIJING'S AFTERMATH: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE U.N. CONFERENCE</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>Beijing's Aftermath</h1>
<h2><i>A Closer Look at the U.N. Conference</i></h2>

</center>

<font size=+3>A</font>fter much heated debate prior to and during the 
United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, the 
final Platform for Action was adopted on September 15, 1995.

<p>

What does the final document say?  And what are the implications of the
document for families, both in America and abroad?  This report
seeks to answer these questions as well as to shed light on the
inner processes surrounding the adoption of the Beijing Platform.

<p>

<center><h3>General Assessment</h3></center>

<p>

The United Nations spent $2.5 million to sponsor the Beijing
conference -- $1.8 million for conference services and $700,000
for public information.  Moreover, China incurred additional expenses
to host the event.  It took 12 days and a half-dozen committees
for the 4,969 delegates representing 189 countries to hammer out
the Beijing Platform for Action -- all the time under constant
pressure from 4,020 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
the watchful eyes of 3,235 members of the media.

<p>

The Beijing document, written over the course of two years, primarily
by NGOs from the old-line radical women's movement in collaboration
with several U.N. staff, arrived in Beijing with one third of
its text in brackets to show it was under challenge by various
government delegates.  (Brackets denoted areas of the text which
were disputed by government delegates.  No brackets could remain
in the final document.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
What the feminists wanted<br>
from the Beijing conference<br>
was a redefinition of 'woman'<br>
in the radical feminist mold.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The document that emerged from Beijing was an unwieldy mixture
of ideas, reflecting, in part, the many different factions represented.
But by far, this &quot;agenda for women's empowerment&quot; was
most heavily influenced by radical feminists advocating a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  In fact, several prominent national delegations
were led by radical feminists -- notably those from the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and the European
Union.  These delegations demonstrated their determination to
extend international recognition of women's reproductive &quot;rights&quot;
beyond the Cairo Conference of 1994.

<p>

What the feminists wanted from the Beijing conference was a redefinition
of &quot;woman&quot; in the radical feminist mold.  They wanted
the U.N. to declare that women had a universal right to abortion
and that abortion was an acceptable means of family planning.
They wanted to enshrine the &quot;rights&quot; of adolescents
to information and medical services where sex and AIDS were concerned,
without the &quot;interference&quot; of parents.  They wanted
an endorsement of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as an entree
for lesbian &quot;rights&quot; and, short of that, they wanted
the phrase &quot;in all its various forms&quot; appended to all
mentions of &quot;the family&quot; in the document, so as to make
way for non-traditional unions.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

What the feminists ended up with was something in between.  Abortion
was not declared a universal right nor accepted as a means of
family planning in the Platform.  However, controlling one's sexual 
and reproductive activity was declared
a &quot;human right.&quot;  Parents' rights were not completely
overruled, but they were subordinated to &quot;the best interests
of the child.&quot; Lesbian &quot;rights&quot; language was finally excluded 
at 4:45 a.m. the day scheduled for the adoption of the document, as weary
delegates looking for a few hours of sleep simply deleted all
references to sexual orientation from the document.  Nonetheless,
as Main Committee Chair Patricia Licuanan pointed out, this did
not change the fact that the day before, for the first time, a
lesbian had addressed a U.N. plenary on behalf of lesbian &quot;rights.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Issues in the Beijing Document</h3></center>

<p>

It must be acknowledged that the Beijing document contains some
positive aspects in that it denounces many terrible injustices
still suffered by women -- especially women in the Third World.
For example, the Platform denounces societies where son-preference
is practiced.  It spotlights poverty as a cause of women's suffering.
It condemns domestic battering and harassment in the workplace
and denounces forced prostitution, pornography, female genital
mutilation, bride-burning, sexual slavery and forced sterilization.
It condemns rape, especially as a weapon of war.

<p>

Still, as critics have pointed out, the document cultivates a
terrible moral and philosophic blindness to the human dignity
of women.  In many ways, the document is a monument to the &quot;exaggerated
individualism&quot; which characterizes the radical feminist movement.
It sees the role of wife and mother as impediments to a woman's
self-realization while refusing to recognize the harms, such as
disease and poverty, that are caused by irresponsible sexual behavior.

<p>

To take the issues in the Beijing document one by one:

<p>

<h4>1. Women's Roles</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world's women are wives
and mothers, the Beijing document barely considers them in this
capacity.  Positive comments on women in connection with the family
are stuffed into a single paragraph (number 30), which reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Women play a critical role in the family.  The family is
the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened.
It is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support.
In different cultural, political and social systems, various
forms of the family exist.  The rights, capabilities and responsibilities
of family members must be respected.  Women make a great contribution
to the welfare of the family and to the development of society,
which is still not recognized or considered in its full importance.
The social significance of maternity, motherhood, and the role
of parents in the family and in the upbringing of children should
be acknowledged.  Maternity, motherhood, parenting and the role
of women in procreation must not be a basis for discrimination
nor restrict the full participation of women in society.  Recognition
should also be given to the important role often played by women in many 
countries in caring for other members of their family.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

This paragraph is one of the few passages in the document which
speaks of women in connection with the family.  Another mention
(barely a nod) is paragraph 245b which urges that women's life
experiences, &quot;including, but not limited to their experiences
of balancing work and family responsibilities as mothers, as professionals,
as managers and entrepreneurs,&quot; be included in media depictions.

<p>

Elsewhere in the document, marriage is mentioned in a negative
way as, for example, in the context of dowry problems.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<h4>2. The Family</h4>

<p>

While the March, 1995 Copenhagen Programme devoted an entire
section to &quot;the family,&quot; and the September, 1994 Cairo
Plan of Action included a chapter on &quot;the family,&quot; the
Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s longest document discussing
women, almost completely ignores the subject. The only mention
of &quot;the family&quot; of any length in the Beijing Platform
of Action is in the same paragraph 30, mentioned above.

<p>

Before it begins discussing &quot;motherhood,&quot; that paragraph
says: &quot;The family is the basic unit of society and as such
should be strengthened.  It is entitled to receive comprehensive
protection and support.  In different cultural, political and
social systems, various forms of the family exist. The rights,
capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected....
The upbringing of children requires shared responsibility of parents,
women and men and society as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Paragraph 30 was one of the most hotly debated sections in the
document.  From the first preparatory committee meeting in Jakarta,
pro-life delegates struggled to guarantee language acknowledging
the importance of the family (in its traditional sense) both in
the lives of women and to society at large, as stated in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948).  Feminists, on the other hand,
insisted on using the phrase &quot;the family in all its forms&quot;
to allow for homosexual unions.  A compromise sentence -- &quot;In
different cultural, political and social systems, various forms
of the family exist&quot; -- was added in Beijing to take into
account the existence of single-parent families and extended families.
Even this compromise sentence, however, could be misinterpreted
to condone homosexual unions.  It could also leave the door open
for &quot;the whole village&quot; (or more precisely, the state)
to direct the upbringing of children.

<p>

&quot;Family&quot; is mentioned again (cursorily) in the Beijing
document (paragraph 93) as one responsibility among many in a
woman's life.  It is mentioned in paragraph 285, where the document
speaks of the family's role in promoting the equality of the 
&quot;girl-child&quot; and in paragraph 108c, where men are encouraged 
&quot;to share equally in childcare and household work and to provide 
financial support for their families even if they do not live with 
them.&quot; The few other mentions of &quot;family&quot; in the document
are very negative.  In paragraph 114a, for example, the family
is mentioned as the venue for battering, sexual abuse, marital
rape, female genital mutilation, and other acts of violence against
women.

<p>

<h4>3. Women's Health</h4>

<p>

The women's health section is the longest and one of the most
troubling.  It begins rhapsodically, with the statement, &quot;Women
have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard
of physical and mental health... Health is a state of complete
physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity&quot; (paragraph 91).  To this it adds
(repeating Cairo) in paragraph 96: &quot;Reproductive health is
a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters
relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and 
processes.&quot;

<p>

To the point of neglecting most health problems, the document
concentrates on sexual or reproductive health.  AIDS alone gets
roughly 20 paragraphs, whereas cardiac disease and cancer are
mentioned only once or twice.  The document almost completely
ignores the problem of tropical disease which decimates female
populations in the Third World.

<p>

<h4>4. Reproductive Rights</h4>

<p>

The Beijing Declaration (paragraph 17) asserts that &quot;[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women
to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own
fertility, is basic to their empowerment.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Lesbian 'rights' language<br>
was finally excluded as<br>
weary delegates looking<br>
for a few hours of sleep<br>
deleted all references<br>
to sexual orientation<br>
from the document.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the most stunning part of the Platform is its pronouncement
that women have a &quot;human right&quot; to control their own
sexuality and reproduction.  Paragraph 97 of the health section
declares that: &quot;The human rights of women include their right
to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters
related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive 
health.&quot;

<p>

Raising a woman's right to control her own sexuality and reproduction
to a &quot;human right&quot; is a considerable step beyond the
1993 Vienna Programme of Action's statement that &quot;reproductive
rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples
and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing
and timing of their children and to have the information and means
to do so.&quot;  It is also a considerable step beyond Cairo's
similar statement on the subject.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Beijing document<br>
contains some positive<br>
aspects: it denounces<br>
forced prostitution,<br>
pornography, genital<br>
mutilation, bride-burning,<br>
sexual slavery and forced<br>
sterilization. It condemns<br>
rape, expecially as a<br>
weapon of war.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1994 Cairo document had asserted that &quot;reproductive
rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized
in national laws, international human rights documents and other
relevant U.N. consensus documents.&quot;  Moreover, the Beijing
Plan of Action had originally labelled controlling one's own fertility
&quot;a sexual right,&quot; but not &quot;a human right.&quot;
A woman's &quot;human right&quot; to control her sexual and reproductive
health could be understood to mean that she has a &quot;human
right&quot; to promiscuity, homosexuality and to abortion.

<p>

When this language was adopted in committee on September 10,
the Holy See was very concerned by what it saw as the invention
of a new &quot;human right.&quot;  At the conference and, more
recently, in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (September 21, 1995),
the Holy See delegation chief Mary Ann Glendon, an American and
professor of law at Harvard University, protested the Conference's
tampering with the Universal Declaration. &quot;All this is 
evidence,&quot; she said, &quot;of the increasing colonization of the 
great Universal Human Rights tradition by an impoverished U.S.-style 
libertarian rights dialectic whose features are (1) rights envisioned without 
corresponding individual or social responsibilities; (2) one's favorite 
rights (i.e., speech, property, etc.) touted as absolute while other
rights are ignored; (3) the rights-bearer is imagined as radically
autonomous and self-sufficient; and (4) the creation of new rights
which are often in conflict with one another (e.g., the right
to smoke versus a clean environment).&quot;

<p>

<h4>5. Abortion</h4>

<p>

Besides the disturbing paragraph 97, the Beijing document makes
no new inroads in promoting the legality of abortion.  Repeating
Cairo, the document says (paragraph 107k), &quot;In no case should
abortion be promoted as a means of family planning.&quot;  But
due to the precedent set at the 1994 Cairo conference, the term
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; in U.N. documents must now always
be understood to imply abortion in those countries where abortion
has been legalized.  Indeed, paragraph 107k continues by saying,
&quot;In circumstances where abortion is not against the law,
such abortions should be safe.&quot;

<p>

Despite the protests of pro-life delegates at both Cairo and
Beijing that abortion is never &quot;safe&quot; for the baby in
question, the Beijing document repeatedly condemns &quot;unsafe
abortions&quot; (which it defines as &quot;a procedure for terminating
an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking necessary skills
or in an environment lacking minimum medical standards&quot;).
For example, paragraph 95 lists &quot;unsafe abortion&quot; among
the consequences of early sexual experience, and paragraph 98
says that &quot;[u]nsafe abortions threaten the lives of a number
of women, presenting a serious public health problem.&quot; 
Paragraph 107k asks governments &quot;to deal with the health impact
of unsafe abortions as a major public health concern and to reduce
the recourse to abortions by increasing and improving family planning
services.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The document is a monument<br>
to the 'exaggerated<br>
individualism' which<br>
characterizes the radical<br>
feminist movement.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

During the negotiations in Beijing, the draft document's several
mentions of unborn life were either struck down or severely weakened.
In each instance where the document formerly mentioned &quot;female
foeticide&quot; (paragraphs 40 ,41, 115bis, etc.), the term was
replaced by &quot;prenatal sex selection.&quot;  But paragraph
276c which condemns son preference and unethical practices such
as prenatal sex selection and female infanticide, still adds,
&quot;This is often compounded by the increasing use of technologies
to determine fetal sex resulting in the abortion of female fetuses.&quot;

<p>

Also notable is paragraph 107k which calls on states to &quot;consider
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who
have undergone illegal abortions.&quot;  This paragraph also states,
&quot;Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given
the highest priority, and every attempt should be made to eliminate
the need for abortion.  Any measures or changes related to abortion
within the health system can only be determined at the national
or local level according to the national legislative process.&quot;
(Given the restrictions on pro-life legislation in this country,
one has to wonder whether the U.S. is in compliance with this
language.)

<p>

Paragraph 107k also states, &quot;In all cases, women should
have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion.  Post-abortion counseling, education and 
family-planning services should be offered promptly, which will also 
help to avoid repeat abortions.&quot;

<p>

<h4>6. Parents' Responsibility for Children</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that Article 26 of the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights states, &quot;Parents have a prior
right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their
children,&quot; the Beijing document hardly acknowledges parental
authority over children.  Indeed, at least 17 references to parental
responsibility for children were deleted from the draft document.

<p>

For example, there is no longer any reference to parents' rights
in paragraph 107m, which asks governments to &quot;[e]nsure that
girls have continuing access to necessary health and nutrition
information and services, as they mature, to facilitate a healthy
transition from childhood to adulthood.&quot;

<p>

Parental rights language was also removed from paragraph 109(1),
which approves condom use for male adolescents.  (Moreover, despite
strong objections voiced by Catholic and Muslim delegates, a paragraph
asking governments to &quot;encourage abstinence as responsible
behavior until marriage&quot; was swiftly discarded at the Beijing
conference, at the urging of the Canadian delegation.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Despite the fact that 70<br>
percent of the world's<br>
women are wives and mothers,<br>
the Beijing document barely<br>
considers them in this capacity.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The only vestige of parental responsibility which remains in
the document relates to the &quot;direction and guidance&quot;
of children.  But this weak language still disregards parents,
leaving most decision-making responsibilities to the child, including
(possibly) the decision of abortion.

<p>

In the end, the key paragraph relating to parents' rights and
children's rights turned out to be paragraph 267.  This  paragraph
reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;The International Conference on Population and Development
recognized, in paragraph 7.3 of the Programme of Action, that
'full attention should be given to the promotion of mutually respectful
and equitable gender relations and particularly to meeting the
educational and service needs of adolescents to enable them to
deal in a positive and responsible way with their sexuality,'
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary consideration.  Support should be given
to integral sexual education for young people with parental support
and guidance that stress the responsibility of males for their
own sexuality and fertility and that help them exercise their
responsibilities.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Paragraph 108e  (about public health campaigns) takes the same
position, asking governments to:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Prepare and disseminate accessible information...to ensure
that men and women, especially young people, can acquire knowledge about 
their health and especially information about sexuality and reproduction, 
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary concern.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

<p>

<h4>7. Religion</h4>

<p>

There is only one paragraph in the Platform for Action dedicated
to the role of religion in women's lives. This paragraph (25bis),
which in its original form cast religion as oppressive to women
(i.e., associating it with extremism and violence), was reworked
to acknowledge that freedom of conscience and religion are recognized
by the Universal Declaration.

<p>

Paragraph 25bis now reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Religion, spirituality and belief play a central role in the 
lives of millions of women and men -- in the way they live, in the 
aspirations that they have for the future. The right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion is unalienable
and must be universally enjoyed.  This right includes the freedom
to have or to adopt the religion or belief of their choice, either
individually or in community with others, in public or in private,
and to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and teaching, in order to realize equality, development
and peace there is a need to fully respect these rights and freedoms.
Religion, thought, conscience and belief may, and can, contribute
to fulfilling women's and men's moral, ethical and spiritual needs,
and to realizing their full potential in society.  However, it
is acknowledged that any form of extremism may have a negative
impact on women and can lead to violence and discrimination.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Within the Beijing Declaration, paragraph 12 includes &quot;the
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief,
thus contributing to the moral, ethical, spiritual and intellectual
needs of women and men&quot; among rights to be protected.  And
on occasion, the document also appends a phrase such as &quot;consistent
with religious and cultural values&quot; (paragraphs 74, 82f)
to qualify injunctions to action.
<p>

<center><h3>Concluding the Conference</h3></center>

<p>

The Platform for Action was hotly argued for twelve days, sometimes
long into the night.  Negotiations about sexual and reproductive
rights as human rights went on sporadically for three days. Canada's 
Ruth Archibald led the five-day drive to remove the document's 17 
references to parental rights.

<p>

But by far the most important and moving proceeding for pro-family
advocates came during the four-hour marathon following the formal
adoption of the Platform on September 15th in which 42 U.N. member
states registered reservations to the Platform.  (These 42 comprised
a full fifth of the organization's membership, not what critics
had at one time called &quot;a handful of Latin American and Moslem
states.&quot;)

<p>

These reservations were especially important because they countered
the claims made by members of the U.S. delegation -- Tim Wirth,
Geraldine Ferraro, Donna Shalala, and health negotiators Nils
Daulaire and Dottie Lamm -- who, throughout the conference, kept
insisting that things were going smoothly.  The reservations also
served to refute the networks, the <I>New York Times</I> and Ford
Foundation representative Frances Kissling (Catholics for a Free
Choice), who, in a consistent stream of disinformation, claimed
that the Vatican was caving in on contraceptives and condoms.

<p>

Announcing its reservations at the conference, the Holy See opted
out of the health section in its entirety, on the grounds that
it concentrated on sexual and reproductive health to the point
of almost failing to address other women's health needs, including
maternal mortality and morbidity. It objected to ambiguous terms
concerning unqualified control over sexuality and fertility which
might be interpreted as an endorsement of abortion and homosexuality.
With regard to the whole human rights section, the Holy See associated
itself with very little besides the quotations from existing human 
rights documents.  It asked that its definition of the word 
&quot;gender&quot;(biological sexual identity: male or female) be affixed 
to the document when it was printed.

<p>

Islamic states clarified that, for them, sexual rights apply
only within marriage, and that they had not agreed to anything
condoning abortion.  Several stressed that the Platform for Action
would be interpreted in their countries according to Sharia (Islamic)
law, especially in regard to inheritance for girls.  The Philippines
objected to treating reproductive rights as human rights.

Malaysia said it would interpret &quot;family&quot; in the document
as the traditional family, and Ecuador said that the family is
the fundamental unit of society.  When the delegate from Niger
prepared to enter her reservation, she said publicly what many
developing country delegates had said earlier in private, &quot;We
hope that joining in the consensus will not be a pre-condition
for [donors'] financing of health programs.&quot;

<p>

In its final statement to the conference, the U.S. stressed its
commitment to the cause of women's empowerment and declared that
the Beijing Platform for Action would serve as a detailed map
for achieving women's equality, development and peace.  However,
neither the United States nor any of the other donor countries who so 
strongly backed the document have promised any new money for women's 
programs. They insisted that no new resources could be provided, turning
down the African and Latin American delegates who contended that
new and additional resources were needed to provide basic health
care to women, which was, for them, the overriding concern of
the conference.

<p>

<center><h3>Beijing's Implications</h3></center>

<p>

There is no doubt that the Beijing document will have consequences
for the family.  A year after Cairo, the first global survey made
by the U.N. examining its membership's progress to fulfill the
promises made in that conference's Plan of Action showed that
out of 53 nations surveyed, 46 have undertaken new policies to
implement the Cairo document.  The other seven nations were recorded
either as having lost ground in implementing the document or stayed
the same.  The U.N. Population Fund has also recently announced
that it increased its budget almost 21 percent in 1994 and another
17.6 percent in 1995, to a total of $312 million.  And plans are
already being considered for another U.N. women's meeting in 2000
and for a declaration of &quot;The Century of Women.&quot;

<p>

While the Beijing conference yielded few high points, one positive
result is that it drew together pro-family, conservative women
who for so long had resisted dealing with the U.N. due to their
general distaste for the organization.  In 1994, there were perhaps
two openly pro-life organizations among the NGOs at the U.N.,
but as recently as last April's PrepCom, there were 50.  The conference
in Beijing -- a long and very expensive journey from the US without
government or U.N. assistance -- drew over 200 women from close
to 150 conservative NGO organizations from 20 countries, including
Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and others.

<p>

Despite their late entrance and the fact that the feminists had
written most of the document, pro-family women became an important
part of the proceedings and undid a good deal of the damage that
preceded their arrival.  They supported pro-family delegates,
long-used to jeering and mockery.  They made the case for family
values on talk radio shows at home, telephoning from Beijing.
They even assisted delegates confused by inadequate U.N. translations,
patiently explaining code words like &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;gender&quot; to Third World delegates.  (Many Africans thought
that &quot;reproductive rights&quot; meant the right to have a
family.)

<p>

Most of all, these pro-family women were able to challenge U.S.
delegates on their partisanship, their lack of responsiveness
to the public, and their dearth of fidelity to traditional human
rights.  When the U.S. unfurled a banner demonstrating how closely
its commitments matched those of WEDO (a radical feminist NGO
led by Bella Abzug), conservative women raised another banner
made from a hotel bedsheet, pointing out where the U.S. had covered
its ears to conservative women.  So uncomfortable did the U.S.
delegation finally become with these new lobbyists that they called
in U.N. security guards to confiscate the conservatives' passes.

<title>THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE</title>

<h1>The Greatest of These is Love</h1>
<h2><i>A Faith-Based Alternative to the Welfare State</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n an 1844 essay entitled &quot;True and False 
Philanthropy,&quot; American preacher William H. McGuffey unwittingly 
diagnosed the ills of the modern welfare state.  McGuffey draws a 
contrast between a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; and a &quot;Mr. Goodman.&quot; 
Mr. Fantom begins: &quot;I despise a narrow field.  O for the reign of 
universal benevolence!  I want to make all mankind good and happy.&quot;
Mr. Goodman responds that &quot;one must begin to love somewhere;
and I think it is natural to love one's own family, and to do
good in one's own neighborhood, as to anybody else.&quot;  Mr.
Goodman laments of Mr. Fantom, &quot;And so, between the great
thing he cannot do, and the little one that he will not do, life
passes, and nothing will be done.&quot;

<p>

Today, the onset of moral relativism has driven a wedge between
those reformers who hope to promote moral uplift and those who
aim only to relieve material needs.  But in 1844, Mr. Fantom and
Mr. Goodman did at least agree that the object of benevolence
was &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; -- or, in more
sophisticated parlance, virtue and individual fulfillment.  Mr.
Fantom and Mr. Goodman parted ways in defining the means to achieve
those ends, and their differences frame the central questions
confronting contemporary reformers.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

First, should the locus of our action be the individual or
the collectivity?  And are we intent upon &quot;making all mankind
good&quot; by coercion, as Mr. Fantom aspired, or in &quot;doing
good&quot; in the context of freedom, along with Mr. Goodman?

<p>

Simply limiting the size of the welfare state will not yield
a sparkling rebirth in the nation's naked cities.  Limiting government
will be necessary, but not sufficient, to repair cultural rot.
The insufficiency of libertarian means, however, does not imply
the existence of some proactive political means that will be adequate
to the task.  Restoring our society will require embracing a vision
of moral autonomy and inherent dignity for every individual.

<p>

<center><h3>Individual or Collectivity?</h3></center>

<p>

Nature has revealed two fundamental truths about man.  He
is perpetually weak and flawed, but also rife with potential for
love and renewal.  Personal failing, in fact, often contains the
seeds of renewal because it discredits an exalted sense of the
self.  By reflecting on the dynamics of human weakness, reason
itself can apprehend a higher law rooted in God, to whom man must
hold himself accountable.

<p>

Conservative theorist Frank Meyer argues that the cornerstone
of civic morality in the West is the Great Commandment &quot;to
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and thy neighbor
as thyself.&quot;  In reflecting on this mandate, Meyer introduces
a paradox.  By ignoring utterly everything but God and individual
persons, the world's most famous invocation to selflessness has
established the individual squarely at the center of the Western
tradition.  The individual must be &quot;the central moral entity,
and society as but a set of relations between persons -- not as
an organism morally superior to persons,&quot;[1] Meyer writes, because
&quot;no community, no state, no association -- only persons,
individual human beings -- can receive the beatific vision or
be redeemed by the divine sacrifice of love.&quot;[2] The words
are radical in implication.  They ask those who believe in the
divine sacrifice of love to acknowledge that healing the culture
will depend on the interaction of individuals, not the clash of
abstract political entities.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Should the locus of our action<br>

all mankind good' by coercion,<br>
or in 'doing good' in the context<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The concept of &quot;interaction,&quot; of course, is a necessary
corollary to the emphasis on the individual.  Meyer's vision of
social harmony, after all, rests on a vision of the individual
redeemed, and man is redeemed only by acquiring a sense of something
larger than himself.  Through a rich and vast array of daily interactions
with each other, individuals mature into complete human beings
with a sense of self-control, but also a sense of connectedness
and mutual obligation.  The state's role in fostering man's nobler
impulses depends ultimately on nurturing, not individuals directly,
but all the small groupings into which human beings organize themselves
-- outside of and distinct from government.

<p>

The moral superiority of individuals meeting each other face
to face, in the space we call &quot;civil society,&quot; emerges
with particular force in the story of a woman named Clara Hale.
A poor woman in her mid-sixties, living in a poor neighborhood,
Clara Hale took in a baby born with a drug addiction and went
on to found Hale House, a group home for addicted children in
Harlem.  &quot;It was Clara Hale who did this,&quot; Michael Joyce
writes, &quot;not an expert, not a bureaucracy.  Had she exercised
her citizenship in the modern, tragically devalued sense of that
term, Clara Hale would merely have advocated through voting and
political activism, more programs for state-funded professionals
to care for these children of God.&quot;  But she did not turn
away from them and speak to society, in the abstract.  She held
each child, one by one, and spoke their names to them.  &quot;Clara
Hale's sense of citizenship, her active and direct participation
in service to her fellow man, displays the vibrancy and proves
the superiority of civil society,&quot;[3] Joyce concludes.

</i></b></font>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The proliferation of need is a cry for a new generation of
Clara Hale's, with an acutely personal sense of moral responsibility.

<p>

<center><h3>Freedom or coercion?</h3></center>

<p>

If the moral development of the individual is the central
concern, then liberty and virtue must be the twin ordering principles
of political and social life.  The pursuit of virtue is the highest
moral good, but it cannot be a political question.  Virtue depends
on individual freedom of choice and can be neither exercised by
collectivities nor achieved by political coercion.  F. A. Hayek
once wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

Freedom is the matrix required for the growth of moral values
-- indeed not merely one value among many but the source of all
values.  It is only where the individual has choice, and its inherent
responsibility, that he has occasion to affirm existing values,
to contribute to their further growth, and to earn moral merit.[4]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The only political means to promote virtue, then, is to establish
and maintain freedom for the individual.

<p>

If virtue depends on the preservation of liberty, however,
it is also true that the maintenance of liberty depends on the
status of virtue.  The meaning of freedom encompasses much more
than the absence of coercion or an abundance of options.  Because
a democratic society requires citizens to be capable of governing
themselves, freedom cannot be an end in itself.  As Lord Acton
put it, &quot;Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish;
it is the freedom to do what you ought.&quot;  Libertarian means,
in short, must serve traditionalist ends, while traditionalism
must resist the temptation to use coercion to promote its own
ends.

<p>

The only satisfactory balance between virtue and freedom
is a vibrant civil society, that sphere of life that includes
all the institutions and interactions that stand between the individual
and the total state.  While the elemental building blocks are
the family and the church, civil society also encompasses the
Boy Scout troop that builds hiking trails for the community, the
school that teaches young ones how to read, and the homeless shelter
that keeps its doors open thanks to dedicated volunteers.  Civil
society may be as formal as the Red Cross chapter that has secured
its 501 (c)(3) tax status or as informal as an afternoon gathering
of young mothers at a neighborhood park.  It is both Hale House
and your house.  Sharing stories around the dinner table, holding
hands with a new widow, or looking men directly in the eye at
the local soup kitchen -- this is the stuff that softens hearts
and melts social barriers.  By maximizing opportunities for service
to one another, civil society promotes the strength of character
that safeguards against freedom's atomistic tendencies.

<p>

The freedom that allows civil society to thrive is, in fact,
much more likely to engender strong communities than the isolated
individuals of liberal myth-making, for human nature predisposes
man to live life in communal settings.  Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote in <i>Democracy in America</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The township is . . . so well rooted in nature that wherever men
assemble it forms itself.  Communal society therefore exists among
all peoples, whatever be their customs and laws.  Man creates
kingdoms and republics, but townships seem to spring directly
from the hand of God.[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The prospects for civil society do depend critically, however,
on the preservation of the nuclear family as the basic unit of
society.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Family</h3></center>

<p>

While his name is almost synonymous with self-interest, Adam
Smith also observed a near-universal human attribute of sympathy
that he identified as the source of human moral sentiments.  Although
distinct from altruism, Smith's notion of &quot;sympathy&quot;
inspired man to seek the approval of his fellow citizens by functioning
in ways that sustained healthy communities.  Endorsing Smith's
hypothesis, John Adams wrote in 1790 that &quot;as Nature intended
men for society, she has endowed them with passions, appetites
and propensities calculated . . . to render them useful to each
other in their social connections&quot;[6] -- if only to win the
love and esteem that gratify the self.

state.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Along with the right of man to be free and independent, the
Founders asserted a strong belief that man was most magnanimous
when functioning as a free individual.  Jefferson for his part
argued that men have an instinctive moral sense that compels them
to respond with assistance when their neighbors are in distress.[7]
In examining the scientific evidence to test Jefferson's contention,
James Q. Wilson found ample evidence that individuals do have
a &quot;moral sense&quot; and that it is formed out of their earliest
interactions in the family.  Scholarly studies of altruism, for
example, demonstrate that &quot;the general pattern of warm familial
relationships is striking.&quot;  In a study of Christians who
rescued Jews during the Holocaust, the long-term rescuers were
very close to their parents, one or both of whom held strong moral
convictions.  And the same pattern reappears in a study of people
who were active for long periods in the civil rights movement
during the 1960s.  Compared to those who were only briefly involved,
the fully committed activists had a warm and close relationship
with one or both parents.[8]

<p>

By fostering human relationships of a type that are not always
found in the wider society, the family fulfills an indispensable
social function.  As the Pope wrote in <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The relationships between members of the family community are
inspired and guided by the law of &quot;free giving.&quot;  By
respecting and fostering personal dignity in each and every one
as the only basis for value, this free giving takes the form of
heartfelt acceptance, encounter and dialogue, disinterested availability,
generous service and deep solidarity.[9]

</i>

</blockquote>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In reviewing a wide variety of studies in developmental psychology,
Wilson found that generous children were indeed raised by parents
who offered nurturing love and consistent discipline and who themselves
engaged in helping others.  Rather than caring intensely only
for members of the immediate family, children and adults who experienced
love at home were precisely the people who were most likely to
aid perfect strangers, often at risk to themselves.[10]

<p>

The empirical evidence, then, provides a powerful rebuttal
to the conception of the moral agent as an abstract force, stripped
of the intimacy and particularity of the family ties that undergird
moral experience in everyday life.  Michael Novak argues that
moral realism itself is the one habit learned in the family that
is most essential for successful self-government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[F]amily life is no utopia.  It isn't meant to be.  Its purpose
is to instruct us in the painful but also mind-enlarging angularities
of human nature.  Such realism, vital to any free republic, arises
from having your own self-images punctured, from learning to endure
tragedies together, from penetrating one another's weaknesses,
and from learning to forgive, to love, to be tolerant, and to
support.  Without such learning how could any civil society survive?[11]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In order to have meaningful content, love for humanity, for the
stranger on the street corner, must evolve from the privilege
of basic human affections -- the experience of one heart knowing
another.

<p>

While grounded in moral realism, acts of personal kindness
elevate and ennoble the doer from within; and in learning the
unique worth of love, theologian Walter Rauschenbusch observed,
we learn to feel the worth of those we ought to love.[12] Thus, love
undergirds both moral autonomy and a sense of the dignity that
belongs to every individual.  Political coercion, by contrast,
is a flimsy tool for social cohesion.  &quot;The frequency with
which our communities have to fall back on . . . coercion is a
symptom of the failure of love, for love can usually dispense
with force.  The more love, the less force; the more force, the
less love,&quot;[13] Rauschenbusch wrote.

<p>

To the extent that centralized government usurps the space
in which families and neighbors thrive -- and thereby politicizes
all relationships -- it trumpets reductionist individualism and
denies the power of love.  Collectivism makes its mistake in assuming
that virtues like selflessness and generosity are a part of human
nature.  Asserting that man has a moral sense (or a variation
on self-interest that mimics a moral sense) is not to say that
man is inherently virtuous or altruistic.  If men were angels,
the loss of family would exact no price.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Community</h3></center>

<p>

It is also true, however, that strong families require strong
communities.  Charles Murray explains that &quot;[a]ffiliation
is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.&quot;[14] A functioning community that promotes a wide
array of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both
for practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.  The passing of values from parent to child,
in fact, presupposes outlets for practice because it involves
-- as Murray puts it -- a &quot;reality test.&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>

How does one bequeath a habit of helping others, of giving, of
generosity, if this has not been a part of one's own life? . . . 
Watching parents support compassionate politicians just isn't
the same. . . .  If parents are engaged in directly paying other
people in the community -- supporting local institutions -- they
at least must do such things as choose whom they will pay and
how much.  And even these actions provide a richer basis for instruction
than signing a 1040 Form and then trying to explain compassion
to the child in the abstract.[15]

</i>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Wilson's empirical findings concur: generous children are
in fact the sons and daughters of generous parents.  He also discovers,
however, that human sympathy is fragile.  Behavior depends, not
only on the development of right instinct, but on the extent to
which the circumstances create a sense of personal responsibility.
Adam Smith devised a famous thought experiment to demonstrate
the point:  If a man were to learn of the destruction of 100 million
Chinese, he might lament their passing, but in a moment would
return placidly to his business or leisure.  But we would recoil
at the thought of a man who in order to save the loss of his little
finger would will the death of the very same number of distant
Chinese. &quot;If our sentiments were directed simply by our
love of humanity,&quot; Wilson observes, &quot;we might feel equal
anguish at both tragedies, but we do not.&quot;[16] Adam Smith provides
the explanation:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

When the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect
upon our conduct, we dare not, as self-love might suggest to us,
prefer the interest of one to that of many.  The man within 
immediately calls.[17]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Conversely, when the happiness or misery of others bears no relation
to our conduct, the man within remains silent.

<p>

Given the evidence that there is a &quot;man within,&quot;
the more appropriate question is -- not whether human beings are
capable of strong community -- but why do we not see more evidence
of community already in play.[18] The answer reflects Adam Smith's
insight about human nature, for civil institutions by definition
are groupings of flesh-and-blood men.  To the extent that the
welfare state has eliminated the necessity of a father who provides,
it has reduced the sense of personal responsibility that kept
him at home through good times and bad.  To the extent that Washington
hires social workers to do the job instead, Sioux City will almost
certainly experience a decline in the numbers of men and women
who feel compelled to volunteer their time at the end of a long
day.  In the words of Nathan Glazer, the reason social policy
weakens civil institutions is

<p><blockquote>

<i>

the simple reality that every piece of social policy substitutes
for some traditional arrangement, whether good or bad, a new arrangement
in which public authorities take over, at least in part, the role
of the family, of the ethnic and neighborhood group, of the voluntary
associations.[19]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In Marvin Olasky's turn of phrase, bad charity drives out good.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Faith</h3></center>

<p>

When families no longer have the benefit of strong communities
-- and many children no longer even have the benefit of family
-- reviving civil society is admittedly more complex than merely
relimiting the size of the welfare state.  Pulling out the knife,
as Professor DiIulio says, is unlikely to resuscitate the dying
man.[20] But neither will a fresh stab wound do the trick.  Civil
society must derive its strength from non-political sources, and
in all probability those sources must spring from a revival of
religious faith.  Relimiting government is essential precisely
because government can stultify, but never revivify, religion.

When public order is lost and the center does not hold, fidelity
to truth demands at least weighing the evidence that faith-based
drug addiction programs save more lives than their secular counterparts.[21]
Short of rigorous empirical calculations, fidelity to the truth
demands engaging in a simple thought experiment:  &quot;If you
are walking down the street in urban America and see four formidable-looking
young males approaching, would you relax a little if you knew
they had just emerged from a Bible study?&quot;  Probably, yes.
The federal government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm that attachment to church is inversely related to violence.[22]
Given the scale of the current crisis and the clarity of the
evidence in defense of faith, many secular authorities are willing
to give religion its due.  The danger is not simply that government
will soften its bias against faith-based programs too late, but
that government dollars will disarm the very emphasis on faith
that made those programs a success in the first place.

<p>

Government contracting with community-based institutions,
including religious institutions, will almost certainly result
in a more efficient and effective delivery of services.  The issue
at hand, however, is neither efficiency nor material quality.
The issue is transforming lives ravaged, not by a lack of material
resources, but by a lack of the spiritual and moral fiber necessary
to sustain independence.  In a comprehensive study of religious
charities, Amy Sherman concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to
live out its moral implications in every significant area of their
lives, from breaking drug addictions and repairing family relationships
to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work.  But state
social-service contracts aren't necessarily concerned with such
outcomes; they focus on meals served, beds available, and checks
cashed.[23]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Faith-based programs, like men, cannot serve both God and mammon
too.

<p>

Even programs that retain their original vision are likely
to face burdensome regulations that dilute the emphasis on faith.
In explaining why faith-based programs succeed when state-licensed
versions fail, Ed MacClellan, executive director of the Florida
Association of Christian Child Caring Agencies (FACCCA) summarizes
his experience in plain, unvarnished English:  &quot;'In the licensed
homes you'll find Jesus, but you'll have to look for him.  He's
put away in the chapel or in a closet. . . .   Go to one of our
homes, and Jesus is gonna open the front door. That's the 
difference.'&quot;[24] Regardless of right or wrong, the fact is that 
Jesus is unlikely to be opening the door at a public housing project any 
time soon. Faith-minded policymakers must accept that limitation for the
present, and plan accordingly.

<p>

While the loss of a programmatic emphasis on religion is
the most obvious compromise, government funding also changes the
quality of personal relationships in subtle ways that can undercut
any remaining vestiges of faith.  Government paperwork diverts
time from the face-to-face ministry that is the single most important
corrective to the bureaucratic model -- and the most likely avenue
to spiritual renewal.  Quite often the very thing needed, says
Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids/Hope/USA, is simply &quot;a person
who cares, befriending another person who is lonely.&quot;[25] Star
Parker, former welfare recipient, says from personal experience
that the question posed to welfare recipients must be: &quot;God
or government?&quot;[26] But government money damages the credibility
of the personal example individual volunteers can set for the
beneficiaries of their programs.  Reverend Eddie Edwards, who
oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit
called Joy of Jesus, explains: &quot;When we are working with
people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient,
helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult
to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public
assistance.&quot;[27] Indeed, the most powerful witness men and women
of faith can offer is that dependence on God obviates the need
for dependence on the state.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

As long as state funding remains a part of the landscape,
the church may do good works, but it will fail to realize its
full potential as the vital center of community life.  The heart
of Charles Murray's argument about the prospects for a rebirth
of civil society must be applied with particular urgency to the
institution that is charged with remoralizing civil society.
&quot;The church will be a satisfying institution of community
life (not just religious life) to the extent that the members
have something important to do&quot; -- that will not otherwise
be done.  But &quot;that institutional role will atrophy to the
extent that it does not.&quot;[28] Just as it will be impossible
to secure the benefits of community on the cheap, it will prove
impossible to restore the influence of faith in America without
churchgoers paying a rather steep price to vindicate that faith
in their own lives, day by day.

<p>

Lest the burden seem too overwhelming, Virgil Gulker places
the problem in perspective:  &quot;Somehow the statistics cover
up the fact that behind every number is a name and a face -- a
real person with a real need.  Categories and percentages seem
beyond our grasp, but individuals can be helped.&quot;[29] Faith
believes that the power of just one changed life is in fact more
powerful than an activist state.

<p>

Ultimately, collectivism itself is at war with faith; for,
it is a vision not of individuals finding love and renewal in
the presence of God, but of godlike individuals contriving the
salvation of the masses.  To vindicate the exaltation of an elite
-- often in the face of demonstrated failures to deliver the promised
goods -- collectivism insists upon an abstraction called &quot;society&quot;
to which all moral problems finally refer.  By absolving individuals
of personal responsibility, collectivism enervates the faith that
springs from man's reckoning with his own inadequacy.  But it
also leaves real, flesh-and-blood individuals hurting, by decreasing
the likelihood that men will stir themselves to serve each other
at the deepest point of need.  As Mr. Goodman lamented of Mr.
Fantom, &quot;Between the great thing [man] cannot do, and the
little one that he will not do, life passes, and nothing will
be done.&quot;

<center><h3>What Can Be Done?</h3></center>

<p>

In short, a myriad of the &quot;little things&quot; that
together will equal more than the sum of the parts.  In 1976,
Dr. Virgil Gulker founded an organization called Love, Inc. that
seeks to bridge the gap between needy individuals and suburban
church members.  Someone once observed that Love, Inc. is distinctive
because it has no heroes.  Its sole purpose is to mobilize ordinary
individuals to serve the poor, by making the needs both specific
and manageable and by providing the appropriate training for volunteers.
Today, some 4,000 churches nationwide are involved in Love, Inc.,
while other individuals like Reverend Ronald Moore in Jackson,
Mississippi are developing their own training curriculum to help
mobilize a critical mass of churches.

<p>

Dr. Gulker, for his part, has launched a new venture called
Kids/Hope/USA that links adult volunteers in one-to-one relationships
with at-risk children.  Echoing Wilson's empirical findings, Dr.
Gulker speaks from experience: &quot;[When] suffering people remain
nameless and faceless, a mass 'out there' who do not activate
our sense of personal responsibility, . . . [w]hen we lack direct
contact with people's pain, their needs become merely one item
on our agenda -- and not necessarily an important item. . . .
Thus ministry shaped by distance . . . is fatal to those in need.&quot;[30]
Ministry to individuals one by one, on the other hand, is life-giving.
Americans have grown too accustomed to sweeping government action,
aimed at amorphous collective masses.  We must learn to see social
problems as individual responsibilities, but first we must affix
names and faces to the need.

<p>

Secondly, we must find ways to divert economic resources
from failed government programs to successful private-sector initiatives.
But a word of caution at the outset.

<p>

Welfare state advocates often defend bureaucratic programs
by arguing that the private sector cannot possibly replicate existing
levels of government spending.  &quot;Based on the current welfare
model,&quot; Father Robert Sirico replies, &quot;they are right.
All levels of government spend $950 billion a year on welfare
programs.  Charities, excluding churches, spend less than half
this sum (about $360 billion).  Private efforts clearly cannot
assume the functions of the present welfare state.  But why should
they?  An annual welfare budget of $300 billion is roughly three
times the amount of money it would take to raise the incomes of
all poor people above the poverty line.&quot;[31]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The welfare delivery system, like any other bureaucracy-laden
government monopoly, is woefully inefficient.  One study found
that less than 35 cents out of every welfare dollar was paid in
cash directly to the needy.[32] And every year, welfare consumes
more tax dollars without any incentives to cut costs or monitor
results.  In the words of Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith,
&quot;The federal government offers the best deal in town:  The
more you spend, the more you get. Don't worry about results.&quot;[33]
The national average spending for government-subsidized homeless
shelters is $22 per person per day.  By contrast, Sister Connie
Driscoll operates St. Martin de Porres House of Hope, a homeless
shelter in Chicago, at an average cost of $6.73 per person per
day.  Sister Connie receives no government funding.  But she does
get results.  The House of Hope has the most impressive success
rate in Chicago.  Only 6 percent of its residents find themselves
on the street again.

<p>

The key to success, of course, is that Sister Connie sets
behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.  The changes
in behavior pose savings over and above the dollars saved by a
more efficient delivery of goods and services.  In a monograph
entitled &quot;The Market Foundations of Philanthropy,&quot; Richard
McKenzie explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The donors' demands for reforms on the part of recipients carry
weight for a simple reason:  the recipients understand that the
private aid can be withdrawn (without an act of Congress), which
means that private aid is much more likely to be performance-based
and cost-effective.[34]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Just as government bureaucrats treat the agency budget as
a proxy goal to be maximized, recipients of open-ended checks
face their own perverse incentives to perpetuate the very behavior
that drains the tax dollars of millions of hard-working Americans
year after year.  The tax burden in turn undermines the economic
expansiveness that could create jobs -- and fund additional philanthropic
giving.[35]

<p>

Just as the private sector need not replace the welfare state
dollar for dollar, efforts to build private sector capacity do
not depend on an increase in charitable giving by every American.
Only a reasonable percentage of the population must participate.
And voluntary giving is certainly an attractive alternative to
taxation.  Far from serving as an efficient way to raise money
for public purposes, taxation hurts the economy by creating a
disincentive effect for production as well as a new layer of compliance
costs.  Both costs disappear under a voluntary system.  Until
the twentieth-century love affair with government, James Payne
notes in <I>The Public Interest</I>, logic dictated that voluntarism
was the &quot;principal way money was raised for social purposes.&quot;[36]

<p>

Despite the growing bite of government taxation, recent levels
of charitable giving remain impressive.  If the value of volunteer
labor is included, the current value of private charity exceeds
all government welfare spending combined.[37] Payne concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[Academic preoccupation with the free-rider problem] overlooks
the complexity of human behavior.  Human beings can be generous
as well as selfish, and this generosity makes possible the hundreds
of thousands of voluntary giving arrangements that we see all
across the country. . . . The moral power of this kind of voluntary
transaction can never be achieved with a tax system based on force.
. . .  It is worth speculating how such giving might thrive in
a society that decided to emphasize it, in a society where children
were taught, from their earliest days, that voluntary giving is
needed to sustain civilization.[38]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Charitable activity does appear to correlate closely with
a coherent system of beliefs.  <I>The American Enterprise</I>
reports that government-shrinking conservatives are more than
twice as likely to volunteer time and likely to give more than
twice as big a percentage of their annual incomes to charity.
The most generous subgroup within the population is religious
conservatives.[39]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Research shows, moreover, that giving patterns among individual
Americans have changed along with changes in the role of government.
From the early 1940s through 1964, as the U.S. grew wealthier,
an increasing portion of wealth was given to charities.  In the
mid-1960s, however, the trend was reversed -- despite the fact
that total wealth continued to increase.  A rise in charitable
giving did not reappear until 1981 (during a period of hard times,
incidentally) when the Reagan Administration proposed cuts in
social welfare spending and urged a return to voluntarism.[40] Richard
McKenzie has demonstrated that, as a result, charitable giving
by Americans in the 1980s increased by all possible measures,[41]
while voluntarism made a resurgence among both college students
and professionals.  In 1979, about 300 companies had programs
to encourage workers to participate in community service projects.
By the late 1980s, the number had increased to 600, and at least
200 companies were sending workers into the community on company
time.  Between 1984 and 1989, the number of Americans reporting
charitable volunteer work in Gallup polls rose from 34 percent
to 50 percent.[42]

<p>

Anecdotal evidence from more recent experiments also indicates
that private giving increases in response to cuts in public funding.
In reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court injunction against Milwaukee's
newly-expanded school-choice program, which allows parents to
use vouchers at private sectarian schools, residents throughout
the state donated more than $1.2 million to help children stay
in the schools of their choice.[43] And the Public Broadcasting Service
reports a 12 percent increase in private giving over last year.
Federal funds for PBS are scheduled to decrease 6 percent in
1996 and more in 1997.  According to Stu Kantor, PBS associate
director of corporate information, &quot;I think people have been
responding to reports in the news about budgetary pressures facing
PBS.&quot;[44]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A number of technical analyses confirm, conversely, that
government spending crowds out private philanthropy.  Russell
Roberts, for example, concluded succinctly in the <I>Journal of
Political Economy</I>:  &quot;Current data and evidence from the
Depression yield support for the crowding-out result.  The huge
growth in public transfers in the 1930s crowded out private antipoverty
efforts and fundamentally changed the nature of private charity.
Current data also support this conclusion.&quot;[45] The explanation
rests on a simple truth about human nature:  People tend to defer
responsibility when someone else will answer the bell.  Charles
Murray captures the problem with characteristic genius:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

At the microlevel, the dialogue between the government and the
citizen goes roughly like this:

<p>

Do you want to go out and feed the hungry or are you going to
sit here and watch television?

<p>

I'm tired.  What'll happen if I don't go?

<p>

Well, if you don't go I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

<p>

In that case, you go.[46]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

By rewriting the dialogue between citizen and government,
cuts in government spending alone are likely to trigger increases
in voluntary giving.  At the very least, taxpayers should be allowed
to shift a percentage of their personal income tax payments from
public programs to private charities.  Several legislators have
already proposed a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for contributions
to charities engaged in poverty-fighting efforts (defined by the
income level of the service recipients).  Ideally, taxpayers would
be allowed to divert up to 41 percent of their personal income
tax payments -- that is, the share of total individual income
taxes that currently goes to federal means-tested welfare programs.[47]
For each tax dollar allocated to private sector charity, public
sector charity would be reduced by a dollar.  Thus, with the credit,
private organizations would at last be able to compete on a level
playing field for welfare tax dollars.  And taxpayers would have
the opportunity to indicate their preference: more government
bureaucracy or individuals helping individuals down the street?

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The dollars sent to poverty-fighting organizations would
not undermine giving to museums and symphony orchestras because
money donated to cultural institutions would still be tax deductible.
At present, the tax code permits charitable deductions from taxable
income -- not from the check owed the I.R.S.  Thus, under the
current system, donors in higher tax brackets benefit more from
charitable giving.  Congress should consider elevating the charitable
deduction to 120 percent, but also restoring the deduction to
non-itemizers.

<p>

Approximately seven out of 10 taxpayers opt for the standard
deduction -- even when they have donated a substantial amount
-- usually because they have no mortgage interest deduction.
An above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions for non-itemizing
taxpayers would not only benefit many middle-to-low-income people,
but is also likely to increase charitable giving to an array of
neighborhood organizations involved in poverty prevention efforts.
During 1985-1986, when a charitable deduction for non-itemizers
was last in place, charitable giving among non-itemizers did in
fact rise dramatically.  And tax provisions that empower <I>everyone</I>, 
not just people of means, are precisely the reforms most likely
to benefit the health clinics and mentoring programs in low-and
middle-income neighborhoods.  Surveys show that people who make
the least are inclined to give the highest percentage of their
income to help neighbors in need.[48]

<p>

While block grants simply reallocate power among public bureaucracies,
tax breaks for giving restore power to individual citizens and
communities -- power that in turn will fuel the ethic of caring
that is the true hallmark of freedom.  In <I>Prospects for Conservatives</I>, 
Russell Kirk wrote:  &quot;The enlightened conservative .
. . knows that the just and ordered society is that in which Love
governs us, so far as Love ever can reign in this world of sorrows;
and he knows that the anarchical or the tyrannical society is
that in which Love lies corrupt.&quot;[49]

Love lies corrupted today by a welfare state that asks men

is correct that men are &quot;put into this world . . . to aspire
toward the triumph of Love,&quot;[50] then we must aspire toward the
end of a system that thrusts our benevolence out to the remotest
periphery, to people whose names and faces we do not know and
whose hands we cannot hold.  Life for them will not be whole again
until we learn to love, one heart at a time.

<h2>THE LAST WORD</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>My Favorite Volunteer</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n all the years of working with church members, 
my favorite volunteer is a woman in her mid-sixties.  For a long time, 
whenever I would speak with her, she would talk about friends who had 
died and about her arthritis.

<p>

She also talked wistfully about a great disappointment in
her life.  As a girl she had set her goal to become a teacher.
But she came from a poor family, and after the eighth grade she
was required to go out to work to help support her family.  Later
she married, and then she sometimes had to work outside the home
to supplement her husband's earnings and sometimes stayed at home
and cared for her four children.  She never regretted any of this,
but she wondered what might have been.

<p>

I approached this woman one day and said that we needed tutors
for Hispanic and Oriental children.  &quot;Will you tutor?&quot;
I asked.  In effect, I was asking, Will you become the teacher
you always wanted to be?

<p>

&quot;I can't,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I'm too old.&quot;

<p>

&quot;You're not too old,&quot;  I replied.

<p>

&quot;I don't have the skills,&quot; she objected.

<p>

&quot;I'll train you,&quot; I said.

<p>

She finally agreed to go through the training program --
probably to get me off her back.  But she told me she wasn't planning
to tutor; she would just help in other ways.  &quot;Fine,&quot;
I said.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is hard to imagine<br>
that anyone anywhere<br>
was happier that night.<br>
She had become the teacher<br>
she had wanted to be.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

At the end of the training, I asked her to tutor two Hispanic
boys. She gave in.

<p>

In subsequent months, when I saw her, I would ask, &quot;How
is your arthritis?&quot;

<p>

&quot;What?&quot; she would say.  Instead, she would tell
me about the boys.

<p>

&quot;Have you been reading the obituaries lately?&quot;
I would ask.

<p>

&quot;No,&quot; she would answer, and then tell me about
the problems the boys were having.  The boys became her life.

<p>

A week before Christmas she was sitting in her living room,
and she heard a terrible commotion outside.  When she opened the
front door, there stood the two boys in the snow.  They had brought
all their classmates to sing Christmas carols to their &quot;favorite
teacher.&quot;

<p>

It is hard to imagine that anyone anywhere was happier that
night.  She had become the teacher she had wanted to be.

<p>

I often think that this woman, who is my mother, is like
many other people:  all reticence and excuses, but when they get
the right opportunity, the training and the encouragement, they
succeed.

<title>STATUTORY RAPE: THE DIRTY SECRET BEHIND TEEN SEX NUMBERS</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>Statutory Rape:</h1>
<h2><i>The Dirty Secret Behind Teen Sex Numbers</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the common perception that teenage sex 
and pregnancy typically stem from two teenagers getting caught up in the 
heat of the moment, new research reveals that many teenage girls are
being sexually exploited and impregnated by adult men.

<p>

In fact, a recent study published in the <I>American Journal of
Public Health</I> found that adult men fathered two-thirds of
the infants born to school-aged mothers in California in 1993.
On average, these men were 4.2 years older than the senior-high
mothers and 6.7 years older than the junior-high mothers.[1]

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age sired 77 percent of all births
to high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and 51 percent of births
to junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger). Men over age
25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under age
18, and men over age 20 fathered five times more births to junior
high school-aged girls than did junior high school-aged boys.[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to the state of
California. A recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.[3] Additionally, the Alan
Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and America's Teenagers,&quot;
found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced
by males an average of six years their senior.[4] The Urban Institute
cites a study showing that &quot;three quarters of females who
had sexual intercourse before age 14 reported having had sex 
involuntarily.&quot;[5]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

That our culture at large has been slow to recognize this phenomenon
is not surprising. At one time, the picture of teenage pregnancy
did look vastly different than it does today. In 1970, seven of
10 teen births were within marriage. Today, the opposite is true
-- seven of 10 teen births are out-of-wedlock[6] . . . and many are
the results of statutory rape and victimization.

<p>

In many respects, the rise in statutory rape is the tragic and
predictable consequence of the larger moral free-for-all that
began during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. As
sex was severed from the context of marriage and perceived barriers
to personal &quot;freedom&quot; were torn down, the door was opened
to a &quot;liberation&quot; in which predators were given easier
access to the most vulnerable in our society.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: Fatherlessness and Child Abuse</h3></center>

<p>

At the heart of this problem, as with most social pathologies,
is the breakdown of the intact two-parent family unit.

<p>

Over the last 25 years, the change in family patterns has been
dramatic. It used to be that the man in every girl's life was
her father. He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor
and ensuring her safety. But between 1970 and 1995, the share
of married-couple families with dependent children dropped by
one-third, while the proportion of single-parent families nearly
doubled. In 1995, 18.9 million children lived with only one parent,
compared with 8.2 million in 1970. Today, the large number of
single-parent families are increasingly due to illegitimacy rather
than divorce.[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Fatherlessness is associated<br>
with increased risk of child<br>
sexual abuse.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Consequently, fewer fathers are around to protect and defend their
daughters' safety. And with more girls lacking the love and attention
that only a father can give, more of them are vulnerable to abuse,
and that abuse leaves them willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

The research is clear: fatherlessness is associated with increased
risk of child sexual abuse.

<p>

For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'
<I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988) found that children
from disrupted families are at a much higher risk for physical
or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent families.[8]

<p>

A 1993 study in the <I>British Journal of Psychiatry</I> found
that childhood sexual abuse occurred more frequently in women
from disadvantaged and difficult family backgrounds, and that
their risks of becoming a victim were increased if they came from
a broken home.[9]

<p>

Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry</I>.[10]

<p>

Dr. George Rekers of the University of South Carolina School of
Medicine found that compared with girls in intact nuclear families,
girls who lost their fathers through divorce were overly responsive
to males, more likely to be sexually involved with males in adolescence,
and more often pregnant before marriage.[11]

<p>

David Murray, a social anthropologist, explains the effects of
illegitimacy on girls this way: &quot;For the girls, at earliest
nubility comes predation by older males, undeterred by a resident
father who would protect her honor and her safety.&quot;[12]

<p>

One might mistakenly presume that the presence of a male figure,
besides the father, would help alleviate the situation. But in
fact, when illegitimacy or divorce results in a subsequent marriage,
remarriage, or cohabiting relationship, the likelihood of child
abuse increases.

<p>

According to a study by the Canadian researchers Martin Daly and
Margo Wilson, preschool children in stepfamilies are 40 times
as likely as children in intact families to suffer physical or
sexual abuse.[13]

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study in the <i>Journal of Comparative Family
Studies</i> found that, out of 52,000 child abuse cases, 72 percent
involved children living in a household without one or both biological
parents, even though such households comprise roughly a third
of all households with children.[14]

<p>

Not only is fatherlessness associated with child abuse, but abused
children are also more vulnerable to further exploitation, particularly
further sexual exploitation. Kathy Szafran, residential program
director for the Florence Crittenton Homes and Services in West
Virginia, was quoted in <I>The Washington Times</I> as saying,
&quot;It shouldn't be hard to see 'why a child who's been molested
since age 7 is acting out sexually at age 14.'&quot;

<p>

Indeed, research shows that teenage mothers whose babies were
fathered by adult men are disproportionately the childhood victims
of sexual assault by adult men.[15]

<p>

A 1992 Washington state study of 535 adolescent mothers found
that 62 percent of the teenage mothers had had a history of rape
or sexual molestation by men whose ages averaged 27 years.[16] This
study found that, compared with nonabused mothers, abused adolescent
mothers initiated sex earlier, had sex with much older partners,
and engaged in riskier, more frequent, and promiscuous sex.[17]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a recent edition of <I>Newsweek</I>, Joe Klein poignantly described
the connection between fatherlessness, child abuse, and subsequent
sexual victimization when he recounted the personal testimony
of a girl whom he called Charlette. &quot;The guy's name was Mickey.
He was older, in his mid-20s. Charlette was going through a bad
time: her stepfather had come home from prison, was beating her
mother, was beating on her. 'I lived in the streets for a while,
starting when I was 14,' she said. 'I was young and vulnerable.
I had problems. He was going to protect me, teach me things, discipline
my mind. But when I told him I was pregnant, he was gone. I began
to ask around.... I found he had six other children, mostly with
younger girls. I was naive, and he took advantage of me.&quot;
Joe Klein later remarked, &quot;As for the girls, who are inevitably
fatherless, Charlette's yearning for protection -- for a <I>father</I>
-- seems entirely comprehensible.&quot;[18]

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research shows that boys who grow up without fathers are far more
likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity than those
who grow up in two-parent homes.

<p>

According to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy
Review</I>, 60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without
fathers.[19] Furthermore, a research review by Dr. George Rekers of
the University of South Carolina School of Medicine found that
the fatherless boys exhibit greater aggressiveness or exaggerated
masculine behavior.[20]

<p>

It is also important to note that many of these predatory adult
men may have originated from fatherless families in which they,
too, had been abused.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: The Lack of Parental Supervision</h3></center>

<p>

Ensuring that children receive adequate parental supervision is
already a difficult task in today's two-parent homes because the
financial constraints of modern-day life make it increasingly
difficult for one parent to stay at home full-time. But when parents
face single-parenthood because of divorce or illegitimacy, the
difficulties of supervising their children are compounded.

<p>

Research shows that teenagers who are subject to less adult supervision
are more likely to engage in sexual activity. This association
applies not only to homes which lack parental supervision during
the day, but also to neighborhoods in which a high percentage
of the adult labor force works full-time. This effect suggests
that teenagers who are less closely supervised have more opportunity
to engage in sexual behavior.

<p>

While the amount of parental and/or adult supervision that a teenager
receives during the day is difficult to measure, researchers have
often used maternal employment as a proxy for adult supervision
since much teen sexual activity today takes place after school
in the homes of &quot;latchkey&quot; children.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The effect of maternal<br>
employment on early<br>
intercourse is greater<br>
for teens with mothers<br>
employed full-time than<br>
for adolescents with<br>
mothers employed part-<br>
time.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

For example, a 1993 study published in <I>Public Health Reports</I>
found that young males who have mothers that work full-time are
significantly more likely (by 89 percent in blacks and 26 percent
in nonblacks) to have initiated intercourse than are boys with
non-employed mothers. Young black males who have mothers that
work for pay part-time are 56 percent more likely to have started
having intercourse than are those whose mothers are not employed.[21]

<p>

The same study also found that the effect of maternal employment
on early intercourse is greater for teens with mothers employed
full-time than for adolescents with mothers employed part-time.
Compared with non-employed mothers, part-time work is associated
with a 26 percent increase in early intercourse and full-time
work is associated with a 45 percent increase.[22]

<p>

Furthermore, a 1994 study in the <I>Journal of Marriage and the
Family</I> reported that white females whose mothers are employed
outside the home are more likely to have had intercourse than
females whose mothers are not employed.[23]

<p>

This same study also found that the percentage of female labor
force participants who are employed full-time in a given neighborhood
is associated with an increased likelihood of premarital sexual
activity among young women in the neighborhood. This effect, which
is consistent in both black and white female teenagers,[24] suggests
that the deterrent effect of having a parent in the home may be
undermined somewhat if the girl's boyfriend goes home to an empty
house after school.

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study published in the <I>Journal of Adolescent
Health</I> found that white teenage girls whose mothers work for
pay full-time outside the home are more likely to lead promiscuous
lives as adults (have multiple partners) than girls whose mothers
do not work for pay full-time.[25]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Cultural Protections</h3></center>

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
Cultural influences such as the media and schools have also failed
to protect children.

<p>

Television and movies regularly expose children to sexually explicit
images, glamorizing sex and violence. While the instances of this
type of cultural pollution are too numerous to count, one particular
example should be noted here. A recent (March 1996) episode of
the television prime time drama,<I> Chicago Hope</I>, featured
a storyline in which a 14-year-old girl was having sex with an
adult man. The drama explored both viewpoints about why it was
either permissible or impermissible for the young girl to be having
sex with an adult man, but in the end, the show condoned their
sexual relations because they were &quot;in love.&quot;

<p>

In addition to the media, schools have now taken up the mantle
of exposing children to sexually explicit information -- this
time, in the guise of &quot;sex education.&quot; Many school administrators
have mistakenly concluded that the way to &quot;prevent&quot;
the problem of teen pregnancy is to expose children at progressively
younger and younger ages to more explicit sex education in the
school, so that children can learn how to protect themselves with
condoms, etc. But this scenario is a textbook case in which the
&quot;cure&quot; is far worse than the disease.

<p>

The results of the National Survey of Adolescent Males published
in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health Reports</I> show
that young males who were taught about birth control were more
likely to experiment with sex at an earlier age than if they had
received no (formal) instruction.[26]

<p>

Furthermore, explicit sex education can tear down the natural
inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and girls, leaving
them vulnerable to sexual predators. Indeed, pedophiles often
use pornography to lure their young victims.[27]

<p>

In spite of this, the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded, nationally-recognized
organization, has issued national sex education guidelines which
promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation and junior
and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Legal Protections</h3></center>

<p>

Declining cultural norms and values also have a detrimental effect
on laws intended to protect children. When the culture condones
particular kinds of illegal behavior, the law loses its authority
to prosecute. This has clearly been the case with statutory rape
laws.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Laws against statutory rape were originally designed to protect
adolescent girls -- typically aged 16 and under -- from sex under
any circumstance, regardless of whether there was &quot;consent.&quot;
These laws were premised on the belief that young girls were too
immature to be having sex and that they could no more give meaningful
consent to sexual activity than they &quot;could consent to work
nights as a stripper in a bar.&quot;[29] But during the sexual revolution
of the 1960s and 1970s, states began to change their laws to reflect
more permissive cultural attitudes.

<p>

First, the age of consent for sexual activity was lowered or altered.
In two states, Hawaii and Pennsylvania, 14 years is the age of
consent. Many other laws were changed to say that having sex with
a young teenage girl was statutory rape, but sex with a girl in
her mid-teens was only considered statutory rape if the male was
three or four years older than she was. In other words, a 15-year-old
girl could have sex with a 15-year-old boy, but not with a 19-year-old
man.[30]

<p>

For example, in Virginia, 18 is the age of consent. However, a
person can only be prosecuted for rape if the victim is under
13 years old. A lesser felony offense can be charged if a person
three or more years older has consensual intercourse with a 13-
or 14-year old, but it is only a misdemeanor if the offender is
less than three years older. It is also considered only a misdemeanor
if a person over 18 has consensual intercourse with a child aged
15 or older.[31]

<p>

In Indiana, where the age of consent is 16, there is no longer
a crime of statutory rape. Instead, the state can charge an adult
with child molestation if the child is under age 14, or with sexual
misconduct if the minor is 14 or 15 years old. However, the sexual
misconduct charge can only be leveled at people 18 years and older.
Thus, a 17-year-old who has sex with a 14-year-old could not be
charged with sexual misconduct.[32]

<p>

Although it may seem absurd that the United States allowed the
age of sexual consent to be lowered at all, the example of Britain's
current exploration on lowering their own age of sexual consent
laws is revealing. Indeed, the arguments being currently used
by British proponents of lowering the age of consent mirror the
arguments that led the United States down this slippery slope.
Consider the comments of Alison Hadley of The Brook Advisory Centres,
which runs 27 National Health Service-funded birth control clinics
for teenagers and young adults in England, Scotland, and Ulster:
&quot;Teenagers under 16 don't automatically put a brake on their
raging hormones and postpone having sex just because it is decreed
in law. The age of consent also presupposes that we all mature
at the same time. We don't. We often see mature girls of 14 as
well as 16-year-olds with plenty of growing still to do. Like
it or not, many 14- and 15-year-olds are having sex.&quot;[33]

<p>

Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well about the
devastating consequences of that perverse logic.

<font size=+1><b><i>
Laws against statutory<br>
rape were originally<br>
designed to protect<br>
adolescent girls from<br>
sex under any circumstance,<br>
regardless of whether<br>
there was 'consent.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Second, lax law enforcement of statutory rape crimes have added
fuel to the fire. Few courts have given priority to the prosecution
of adults who have sex with minors, especially because they are
pressed with many other cases of violent delinquency and child
abuse. But prosecutors say that the biggest stumbling block against
bringing a case to court is the girls themselves. Many girls are
reluctant, if not hostile witnesses who either recant or refuse
to testify against their adult &quot;lovers,&quot; the fathers
of their children.[34] The girls may also decline to name the father
if they fear retaliation.[35]

<p>

In addition, parents have not usually understood that they can
seek legal protection through the courts. Parents may ask a juvenile
court judge to declare the girl &quot;ungovernable&quot; and order
her not to see the man. But such cases are low in priorities for
courts, and a court order may not stop stubborn lovers anyway.
If juvenile court sanctions fail, parents can take the next step
and press criminal charges. But police and prosecutors say they're
often hamstrung in these cases, by parents afraid that if the
law gets involved, their daughters will run away, and by lack
of evidence when lovestruck girls refuse to testify.[36]

<p>

Third, the law has not always upheld the rights of parents to
protect their children's innocence. For example, the federal family
planning program -- Title X of the Public Health Service Act --
undermines parental authority in their children's reproductive
health decision-making. Title X is a categorical grant program
which gives federal funds to family planning clinics all around
the country. Title X clinics offer contraceptives, pelvic exams,
pregnancy tests, screening for sexually-transmitted diseases,
and sexual health counseling to minors without parental notification
or consent.[37] However, even though the actual law specifies that
family participation is to be encouraged, the federal policy guidelines
state that clinics receiving Title X support must guarantee patient
confidentiality, and this mandate that has been upheld by the
courts.[38]

<p>

Furthermore, Title X clinics have no provisions regarding the
reporting of suspected cases of statutory rape. In fact, these
clinics may be indirectly aiding and abetting the problem in at
least four ways: (1) the clinic does not involve parents, even
in cases where the child is very young and is admittedly &quot;sexually
active,&quot; (2) the clinic's dispensation of contraceptives
can mask a problem that might otherwise be brought to light, (3)
clinics will see and treat &quot;any woman, regardless of age,&quot;
even when that &quot;woman&quot; is 11 or 12 years old,[39] and (4)
counselors are not trained to look for cases of statutory rape
nor are they required to report any suspected cases of statutory
rape to local law enforcement. That omission is especially horrendous
in light of the current data which show that two-thirds of all
teenage births are fathered by adult men.

<p>

<center><h3>Renew Efforts to Prosecute Statutory Rape</h3></center>

<p>

The most direct way to address the problem of statutory rape is
through the law enforcement system. California Governor Pete Wilson
has cracked down on statutory rapists as part of his state's campaign
against teenage pregnancy. Last summer he allocated $2.4 million
to a pilot program for 16 counties to begin prosecuting men who
engage in sex with underage girls, and in January 1996, he pledged
$6 million more for a statewide crackdown.[40]

<p>

The California State Assembly also recently passed a bill which
would add penalties of up to five years in jail for statutory
rape when a minor becomes pregnant. This penalty can be sought
in addition to civil and/or criminal suits for statutory rape.[41]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In Florida, state legislators will soon consider a &quot;Teen
Predators Act&quot; which would create a new child abuse felony
in cases where a man older than 21 impregnates a girl under 16.
A conviction would result in mandatory prison time.[42] Another bill
seeking consideration in Florida is nicknamed MAMA, which stands
for &quot;Make Adult Males Accountable.&quot; This bill would
allow some statutory rapists to be prosecuted under child-abuse
laws, which would have the beneficial effect of requiring medical
facilities, day-care centers, and schools to report statutory
rape as they would any other incident of suspected child abuse.[43]

<p>

Efforts must also be made to change the rhetoric and perception
under which minors are viewed as mature decision-makers. For example,
in the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and
America's Teenagers,&quot; adolescents girls who have been exploited
by adult men are repeatedly referred to as &quot;sexually-experienced
women.&quot;[44] The Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood,
and other proponents of aggressive marketing of contraceptives
and abortions to minor children have consistently refused to use
language that reinforces the need for special protection for teenage
girls and boys -- especially that provided by their families.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The use of &quot;women&quot; in this context serves the purpose
of fostering an egalitarian drive to repeal parental rights statutes,
but masks the emotional and psychological immaturity that makes
sexual activity at this stage of life especially risky.[45]

<p>

Finally, states should seriously consider raising the age of sexual
consent laws to mirror the age of marriage laws. Currently, 16
is the age of sexual consent in most states, but the minimum legal
age of marriage in most states is 18.[46] (A few states have higher
ages for marriage, but no state's marriage law is below the age
of 18, except with parental consent.) This action would not only
allow states to legally prosecute the statutory rape cases which
occur during the later teen years (ages 16-17), but it would also
help to relink sex to its proper context within marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Strengthen the Family</h3></center>

<p>

While public policy can directly address the problem of statutory
rape through legislative means, its ability to impact the root
cause of statutory rape -- family breakdown -- is only indirect
at best. After all, the law cannot -- and should not -- dictate
to families how to raise their children, but the law can and should
encourage behaviors which help strengthen the family through the
use of incentives and disincentives.

<p>

For example, in order to discourage illegitimacy, public policy
makers have sought to implement a &quot;family cap,&quot; a measure
which would halt additional welfare payments to mothers who bear
further illegitimate children while on welfare. Public policy
makers have also sought to overturn no-fault divorce laws and/or
elevate marriage from a &quot;contract&quot; to a &quot;covenant&quot;
relationship in order to support the permanency of marriage. Furthermore,
laws which provide tax relief for families as well as policies
which provide employees with more flexible work hours and/or work-at-home
arrangements may help to increase parental supervision of children.

<p>

While the aforementioned policies are sound and can be very helpful,
they alone cannot break the cycle of illegitimacy and divorce,
especially because the scourges of illegitimacy and divorce are
transferred through generations. That is, children whose parents
are unmarried or divorced are more likely to also one day bear
illegitimate children or have their own marriages end in divorce.[47]
Thus, other non-public policy means of prevention must be encouraged
as well.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

One effective method of prevention which should not be overlooked
is the impact of religion. Indeed, a large body of research shows
that religiously committed individuals are less likely to divorce
or separate from one's spouse.[48] Teenagers with high personal religiosity
are also less likely to engage in premarital sex or cohabit.[49] Another
study found that adolescent males who went to church more often
at age 14 were less likely to have early intercourse.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is a
natural consequence of family breakdown and its subsequent effects
on culture and the law. But what children need now is what they
have always needed -- for adults to protect their innocence. They
need fathers and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws
that punish statutory rapists, and a culture which values and
upholds the sacredness of marital sex, the permanency of marriage,
and the authority of parents.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHO DECIDES HOW CHILDREN ARE RAISED?</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>Parental Rights:</h1>
<h2><i>Who Decides How Children Are Raised?</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom ancient times to modernity, political philosophy 
has grappled with the sensitive relationship between the child, family, 
and state.  In <I>The Republic</I>, Plato wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The wives of our guardians are to be common, and their
children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child,
nor any child his parent. . . .  The proper officers will take
the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there
they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate
quarter.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

In <I>Orthodoxy</I>, G.K. Chesterton observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;In short, the democratic faith is this:  that the
most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves
-- the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws
of the state.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

Like Plato, modern-day utopian thinkers and totalitarian
states have always looked upon the parent-child relationship with
suspicion at best, and more often as the crucial obstacle to ultimate
state power over the individual.  For even if the state is successful
in dissolving all other institutions which mediate between the
individual and state, such as local government, the church, and
private associations, it must still contend with the family unit
as the last bastion of organic relationships from which spring
an individual's prior loyalties.  Because a totalitarian regime
can admit of no prior loyalties, ultimately the natural bonds
between husband and wife, and parent and child must also be dissolved,
reducing even children to the status of atomized individuals,
helpless before the Leviathan.

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Conversely, as Chesterton so eloquently expressed, respect
for the autonomy of the family is as central to the democratic
ideal as popular sovereignty.  The democratic experiment is founded
on an optimism in the ability of the people to manage their own
affairs, in their capacity as citizens with authority over &quot;the
laws of the state,&quot; and in their capacity as parents with
authority over &quot;the rearing of the young.&quot;  Therefore,
restoring parental rights to its original firm foundation in U.S.
constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to reinvigorate
the democratic ideal of citizenship.

<p>

<center><h3>The Constitutional Roots of Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Parental liberty as a fundamental right found a secure place
in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence beginning with two Supreme
Court cases from the 1920s.  The 1923 decision in <I>Meyer v.
Nebraska</I>[1] involved a challenge to a Nebraska state law which
prohibited the teaching of foreign languages in any school --
public or private -- prior to the eighth grade.  In determining
whether or not the foreign-language prohibition unreasonably infringed
upon family rights,[2] the Supreme Court declared that the 14th Amendment
liberty interest &quot;[w]ithout doubt, [] denotes not merely
freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual
to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life,
to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring
up children.&quot;[3] The Court held that the Nebraska statute interfered
with the parents' fundamental right to raise their children, including
the right to have their children learn a foreign language.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
With the parental<br>
responsibility to protect<br>
their children from harm<br>
comes the parental right<br>
to direct their children's<br>
upbringing and education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Two years later, in <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</I>[4] the
Court examined an Oregon state statute compelling parents to send
their children to public schools from ages 8 to 16 -- essentially
banning private education.[5]  While acknowledging that the State
has the authority to enact reasonable regulations to ensure the
basic education of the citizenry,[6] the Court held that in this
instance state authority must yield to the rights of parents.
&quot;Under the doctrine of <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I>, we think
it entirely plain that the [Oregon state] Act of 1922 unreasonably
interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct
the upbringing and education of children under their control&quot;[7]
(citations omitted). The Court stated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments
in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to
standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction
from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere creature
of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

A generation passed before the high court issued another landmark
parental rights decision, <I>Prince v. Massachusetts</I>.[9] The
Court ruled in favor of state authority over the asserted parental
right of Sarah Prince, a Jehovah's Witness.  Prince was the guardian
of a 9-year-old girl whom she took with her to sell religious
pamphlets on the street.  When charged with violating state child
labor laws, Prince claimed that the law violated her religious
freedom and parental rights.  The Court, citing <I>Pierce</I>,
acknowledged parental rights in the strongest terms:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function
and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can
neither supply nor hinder.  And it is in recognition of this that
these decisions have respected the private realm of family life
which the state cannot enter&quot; (citations omitted).</i>[10]

</blockquote><p>

Despite this reaffirmation, the Court recognized that the state
may act to protect children by &quot;limiting parental freedom
and authority in things affecting the child's welfare&quot;[11] 
including protecting the child from &quot;the crippling effects of 
child employment,&quot; especially in public places.[12]

<p>

In 1972, the Supreme Court again considered a case involving
overlapping issues of parental rights and religious freedom.
In <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I>,[13] Amish families desired to remove
their children from school after the eighth grade, violating Wisconsin's
compulsory education law.[14] The Court declared:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Indeed it seems clear that if the State is empowered, as</I> 
parens patriae, <I>to &quot;save&quot; a child from himself
or his Amish parents by requiring an additional two years of compulsory
formal high school education, the State will in large measure
influence, if not determine, the religious future of the child.
Even more markedly than in Prince, therefore, this case involves
the fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of
the State, to guide the religious future and education of their
children.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

While recognizing the State's &quot;high responsibility for
education of its citizens,&quot;[16] the Court concluded that this
interest did not outweigh the Amish parents' religious beliefs
and parent liberty interest in directing the education of their
children.[17]

<p>

<center><h3>The Modern Assault on Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

The state laws overturned by the high court in <I>Meyer</I>
and <I>Pierce</I> were generated by racial and religious tensions
typical of the 1920s (<I>Meyer</I> dealt with anti-German sentiment
following World War I, and <I>Pierce</I>, the anti-Catholicism
of the age).  Recent conflicts between parents and the state involve
a broad range of matters at the very heart of the parent-child
relationship.  The growing parental backlash against schools and
other government bureaucracies is best understood as part of the
overall struggle parents face as they attempt to transmit their
most cherished beliefs to their children in the midst of an anti-family
culture.

<p>

Many social commentators have focused attention on our degraded
popular culture, and it is widely recognized that parents face
an increasingly difficult task in monitoring their children's
exposure to the barrage of harmful images produced by Hollywood,
pop music, and the Internet.  But while a national debate rages
over the proper response to the polluted commercial marketplace,
relatively little attention has been focused on the fact that
too often parents have discovered that their own <I>government</I>
is part of the problem.  Increasingly, parents are demanding that
government policies support, rather than undermine, their authority.

<p>

The past generation has witnessed the growth of  two overlapping
trends in public policy which have significantly undermined parental
authority and family autonomy.  The first is exemplified by laws
giving minors access to abortion and birth control without parental
approval, and in looming threats like the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child.[18] Implicit in these policies is an assumption
that children should be treated as &quot;short adults,&quot; i.e.,
as autonomous individuals, fully capable of making crucial decisions
about their upbringing, and legally entitled to make these decisions
outside the context of their family.  The second trend involves
the state's increasing propensity to substitute its judgment for
that of parents in matters relating to the upbringing and education
of children.

<p>

These trends run counter to the longstanding philosophical
and legal understanding  that with the parental responsibility
to <I>protect</I> their children from harm comes the parental
right to <I>direct</I> their children's upbringing and education.
But in cases where the state allows minors access to the full
range of choices formerly reserved for adults, parents are effectively
prevented from fulfilling their role as protector.  When the state
substitutes its judgment for that of parents by actually making
the choice for the minor, parental responsibility to guide their
children's choices is usurped.

<p>

<center><h3>'Short Adults'</h3></center>

<p>

Historically, the majority of our laws regulating minors' choices
have been of a protective nature.  For example, adults many not
enter into binding contracts with unemancipated minors, on the
assumption that a child should not be legally bound to fulfill
a contract between parties of such unequal bargaining power and
capacity.  Adults are also prohibited from selling alcohol, tobacco,
and pornography to children.  Abuse laws protect children if the
threat comes from within the family.  The law steps in to protect
the child from being harmed by a more powerful agent.

<p>

While it is indisputable that children have rights, parents
traditionally have been considered the proper custodians of these
rights until their children reach adulthood.  &quot;The presumptions
arising from the limited capacities of children account, in large
part, for their general limitation on the exercise of 'choice'
rights.  The law, and traditionally the culture, has assumed that
a basic capacity to make responsible choices is a prerequisite
to meaningful exercise of such rights.&quot;[19]

<font size=+1><b><i>
The so-called 'children's<br>
rights' movement threatens<br>
to destroy a child's most<br>
precious right: the right<br>
to childhood innocence.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1967 case of <I>In re Gault</I>[20] marked the Supreme Court's
first unequivocal ruling that children have constitutional rights.
While <I>Gault</I> involved juvenile court delinquency proceedings,
the Court's reasoning has far broader implications for the general
liberty of children.  Courts have begun to grant children &quot;choice&quot;
rights like adults in select areas, most notably, by guaranteeing
access to birth control and abortion.[21] This has served as a compelling
precedent for other state policies which prevent parents from
controlling minor's choice rights.

<p>

The movement to grant minors full access to the full range
of choices available to adults naturally leads to liberation of
children from their parents, who serve as an obstacle to the free
exercise of these new rights.  But in a tragic irony, the so-called
&quot;children's rights&quot; movement threatens to destroy a
child's most precious right:  the right to childhood innocence.
A startling example of this phenomenon can be found in local
public libraries.  The American Library Association is formally
opposed to any restrictions on a child's ability to check out
any item, no matter how pornographic or inappropriate for children,
regardless of parental objections.[22] The ALA has gone so far as
to refuse to let parents view the check-out records of their minor
children on grounds that such action would violate the child's
privacy rights.[23] The emotional and moral health of children is
thus sacrificed on the altar of &quot;intellectual freedom,&quot;
and parents are again prevented from fulfilling their responsibility
to protect the child.

<p>

The &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda perhaps is best embodied
in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child,[24] an international
treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1989.  According
to the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Convention
&quot;defines the minimum standards for civil, economic, social,
cultural, and political rights of children.&quot;[25] Ratifying nations
are called to guarantee a host of rights to children, including
&quot;the right to freedom of expression; . . . regardless of
frontiers,&quot; and the right &quot;to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion.&quot;[26]

<p>

More than 170 countries have ratified the Convention.  In February
1995, President Bill Clinton sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate
for possible ratification, where it is currently pending.  The
U.S. Constitution declares that international treaties ratified
by the U.S. become the &quot;supreme Law of the Land.&quot;[27] Therefore,
the U.N. Convention raises serious questions as to its implications
for parental rights in the U.S.  Are these &quot;children's rights&quot;
intended to be legally enforceable over and against the rights
and responsibilities of parents? What might be the scope of a
child's right, for example, to &quot;freedom of expression?&quot;[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Substituted Judgment</h3></center>

<p>

Competing interests of the family and state most frequently
meet in the public school arena.  Schools traditionally have functioned
<I>in loco parentis, i.e.,</I> in place of parents. This
implies that parents have delegated partial authority to the school.
But when school officials contradict the will or values of parents,
they exceed their delegated authority and substitute their judgment
for that of the parents.  Several recent examples from around
the country highlight the increasingly brazen tendency toward
substituted judgment in the public schools.

<p>

On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls from the J.T. Lambert
Intermediate School in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, were taken
to the school nurse's office where they were required to remove
their clothes and submit to a genital examination as part of a
&quot;routine&quot; physical.  While Pennsylvania state law allows
for physical examinations at elementary schools, the East Stroudsburg
parents quite naturally did not expect such an examination to
include intrusive vaginal exams.

<p>

One family was horrified to learn that their daughter had been
forced to undergo the exam despite the fact that they had already
taken the option of submitting an exam report from their own doctor.
Their daughter reported that she had told the school official
in charge that her report was on file, but the official said
that the school had lost the report and that the girl had no choice
but to have the exam.  The girl began to cry and plead with the
school officials to use the phone to call her mother.  But she
was prohibited from calling her mother, and the school nurse stood
in front of the door, blocking the exit.  After submitting to
the exam, she came home in tears, physically and emotionally hurt.[29]

<p>

When questioned, the school initially denied that the girls
had been touched at all.  The school then abruptly changed its
position and admitted that gynecological exams had been conducted
on these 11-year-olds to check for sexually-transmitted diseases
and sexual abuse, even though no incident of disease or abuse
had been indicated.  At the time of this writing, several families
had filed suit against the school, which continues to defend its
action.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Unfortunately, the outrage of East Stroudsburg is not an isolated
case.  In Stephens County, Georgia, Sharon and Waymon Earls were
shocked to discover that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had
been driven to a birth control clinic by a public school staffer
without their knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control
pills and condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and
AIDS tests.  Mr. and Mrs. Earls were then denied access to the
test results by the school, which defended its actions on the
grounds that the counselor believed she was doing what was best
for the girls.  The counselor's husband, Stephens County School
Superintendent Ed Mills, admitted that his wife had driven many
other girls to the clinic over the years.[30]

<p>

Public schools are also increasingly adopting policies whereby
an entire class is subjected to mandatory psychological testing
or explicit sex education which contradicts the values taught
at home.  Psychological testing of children is often performed
under the guise of standardized tests which include intrusive
questions about the child's emotional state and sexual experiences,
the child's relationship with his or her parents, and values and
habits within the home.

<p>

For example, a 149-question survey used in Minnesota public
schools without parental approval contains questions such as:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?

<br>

<li>How often have you run away from home?

<br>

<li>Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that you wondered
if anything was worthwhile?</i>[31]

</ul><p>

In California, in 1994, a statewide controversy erupted over
one such test known as the California Learning Assessment System
(CLAS), a mandatory, standardized test administered to over a
million public school students.  After rumors began circulating
among parents regarding the intrusive nature of some of the questions,
the public school bureaucracy added insult to injury by refusing
to let parents even see the CLAS test their children would be
required to take.[32]

<p>

Parents who have challenged intrusive government policies in
court have met with decidedly mixed results.  Three high-profile
cases recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a disheartening
barometer of the status of parental rights.

<p>

<i><b>Newkirk v. Lansing:</b></i>[33]

<p>

During the 1989-1990 school
year, Daniel and Nancy Newkirk from East Lansing, Michigan, discovered
that their 8-year-old son Jason was being psychologically counseled
by an unlicensed, untrained guidance counselor against their express
wishes.  The case began when Jason's teacher told the Newkirks
that their son wasn't &quot;interacting&quot; with classmates
as she thought he should.  The parents agreed to let their son
&quot;play games&quot; (like checkers) with the guidance counselor,
but flatly refused to allow any psychological counseling.

<p>

Despite this apparent understanding, the counselor began subjecting
Jason to &quot;The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game, a Psychotherapeutic
Game for Children.&quot;  While the manufacturer of this game
warns that it is intended for use &quot;only by mental health
professionals,&quot; the counselor had no such training.

<p>

Questions posed to young Jason from the game included:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Tell something about your mother that gets you angry.

<br>

<li>What do you think about a boy who sometimes wished that
his brother were dead?

<br>

<li>What is the worst thing you can say about your family?</i>[34]

</ul><p>

After the counseling began, the Newkirks noticed changes in
their son's attitude, and he began complaining to his parents
about his sessions with the counselor.  The Newkirks' confronted
the school, but were told that the relationship between the boy
and the counselor was &quot;confidential.&quot;  They then had
a psychiatrist examine Jason, who diagnosed the boy as having
suffered emotional damage from the sessions, including separation
anxiety disorder and panic attacks.

<p>

The Newkirks filed suit in July 1991 in U.S. District Court
against the school district and some of the school staff involved.
In March 1993, the U.S. District Court ruled against the parents.
On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling,
and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case,
leaving the Newkirks with no further remedy.

<p>

<i><b>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions:</b></i>[35]

<p>

In 1992, students in a Chelmsford, Massachusetts public high
school were compelled to attend a sex education seminar by Suzi
Landolph entitled &quot;Hot, Sexy, and Safer.&quot;  A transcript
of Ms. Landolph's performance in Chelmsford reveals that it included
simulated masturbation, crude language, and condom licking.  Chelmsford
parents were given neither advance notice nor a chance to remove
their children from the seminar.

<p>

Ronald and Suzanne Brown and other Chelmsford parents filed
suit, alleging that the school's &quot;opt-out&quot; policy was
not followed.  The parents lost their case before the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts, and in March 1996 the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review another major parental rights
case, allowing the lower court decision against the parents to
stand.

<p>

<i><b>Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth:</b></i>[36]

<p>

Elizabeth Curtis and other parents from Falmouth, Massachusetts, filed 
suit in 1992 against their school board's installation of condom vending
machines in their high schools.  Moreover, according to school
board policy, school nurses were to give condoms upon request
to children as young as 11 in the junior high schools, notwithstanding
the written objections of their parents.  The County Superior
Court refused to grant a parental &quot;opt-out&quot; of the condom
program, and an appeal was rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme
Court in July 1995.  In January 1996, Bay State parents suffered
another loss when the U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment
to hear their appeal, further undermining parental rights in the
state of Massachusetts.[37]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Massachusetts Supreme Court maintained that because the
condom program was not &quot;coercive,&quot; the school was not
usurping parental rights:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he students are free to decline to participate in the
program. . . . For their part, the plaintiffs are free to instruct
their children not to participate. . . . Although exposure to
condom vending machines and to the program itself may offend the
moral and religious sensibilities of the plaintiffs, mere exposure
to programs offered at school does not amount to unconstitutional
interference with parental liberties without the existence of
some compulsory aspects to the program.</i>[38]

</blockquote><p>

This passage from <I>Curtis</I> reveals how treating minors
as &quot;short adults&quot; works in tandem with state-substituted
judgment to undermine parental authority.  First, we are told
that the condom program is &quot;voluntary&quot; because the <I>students</I>
&quot;are free to decline to participate,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, they
are autonomous actors capable of making their own decisions about
choices presented to them at school.  The school maintains a facade
of neutrality with regard to the choice presented, but by presenting
to the child extra-curricular options that starkly contradict
the values of the parent, the state is assisting the child in
circumventing the parent's will.

<p>

<center><h3>Reaffirming Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Until recently, the primary battleground in the struggle to
preserve parental rights has been the state and federal court
system.  While individual families continue to press their case
in courts around the country, it has become increasingly clear
that parents need legislative remedies.  As a result, the parental
rights movement has become proactive, inspiring the introduction
of legislation designed to guarantee parental rights at the state
and federal levels.

<p>

In its most common form, the Parental Rights Amendment reads:
<I>&quot;The right of parents to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed.&quot;</I> By codifying
language taken directly from the 1925 <I>Pierce</I> case, the
Amendment would provide parents with an explicit right grounded
in their state constitution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The federal parental<br>
rights legislation is<br>
a negative mandate on<br>
government. It checks<br>
power, not enhances it.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A statute designed to protect parental rights has also been
introduced in Congress.  In the fall of 1995, Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) introduced the &quot;Parental
Rights and Responsibilities Act&quot; (PRRA).  The PRRA would
protect parental rights, including directing or providing for
the education of the child; making a health or mental health care
decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable
corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious
teaching of the child. The PRRA would clarify the fundamental
nature of parental rights, thus providing much-needed direction
to federal and lower courts.

<p>

The high court in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> established
that parental rights are fundamental under the liberty interest
of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.  The state
may not infringe a fundamental right without having a compelling
reason to do so.

<p>

In several important cases, however, lower courts have begun
to consider parental rights as less than fundamental, allowing
the state to demonstrate merely a &quot;rational basis&quot; for
infringing the right -- a much lower hurdle to clear.[39] By declining
to review lower court decisions in cases such as <I>Newkirk v.
Lansing, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer,</I> and <I>Curtis v. Falmouth</I>
-- each of which treated parental rights as less than fundamental
-- the Supreme Court has allowed the rights it enunciated long
ago in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> to die the proverbial &quot;death
of a thousand cuts.&quot; 

<p>

The PRRA would codify the Supreme Court's longstanding interpretation
of parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest, and would
instruct federal and lower courts to employ the &quot;compelling
interest&quot; test when considering parental rights cases.

<p>

Some have claimed that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities
Act raises federalism concerns.  But by virtue of the rulings
in <I>Meyer, Pierce, Yoder</I> and others, the federal government,
through the Supreme Court, has already acted to protect parental
rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Congress
is given express authority to enact legislation to protect due
process rights of citizens by Section Five of the 14th Amendment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The clash over parental rights<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

It is important to remember that federal parental rights legislation
would not give Congress substantive authority over areas which
are properly a matter of state jurisdiction, such as education.
But when state regulation of education results in the violation
of  parents' constitutional rights, the federal government may
intervene to protect these rights.[40]

<p>

The federal parental rights legislation would not expand government
by creating a new federal &quot;program.&quot;  The PRRA would
not increase federal spending or require a new federal administrative
agency. Rather, the PRRA is a <I>negative</I> mandate on government.
It checks power, not enhances it.

<p>

<center><h3>The Fundamental Question: Who Decides?</h3></center>

<p>

Critics of both the federal parental rights bill and the state
constitutional amendments typically claim that parental rights
laws would make it tougher for the state to protect children from
abuse, and would give one parent the right to dictate school curriculum
for everyone else's child, leading to education gridlock.

<p>

These and most other criticisms are grounded in the mistaken
notion that these proposals would provide an <I>absolute</I> right
for parents, which would override any state interest in the welfare
and education of children.  But as both proposals seek to codify
the Meyer-Pierce doctrine, the well-established limits to parental
rights under this doctrine would continue to apply.

<p>

For example, in <I>Prince</I>, the high court made it clear
that &quot;neither the right of religion <I>nor the rights of
parents are beyond limitation</I>&quot; (Emphasis added).
<I>Prince</I> identified numerous areas in which the state may set
limits on parental rights, such as compulsory school attendance,
mandatory vaccination policies, and child labor laws.  And in
<I>Runyon v. McCrary,</I>[41] the Supreme Court held that parents
&quot;have no constitutional right to provide their children with
. . . education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.&quot;
All constitutional rights have their limits, and parental rights
are no exception.

<p>

The clash over parental rights proposals begs the fundamental
question: <I>Who decides what's in the best interests of childen?
Parents? Or the government?</I>  Are ordinary parents generally
competent to raise their children or should parents defer to elite
authorities backed by state power?

<p>

Unable to attack the underlying constitutional doctrine of
parent's rights, yet adamantly opposed to the people acting to
codify this doctrine through the democratic process, opponents
sometimes find themselves in the awkward position best expressed
by Elliot Mincberg, Executive Director of People for the American
Way, in criticizing the state Parental Rights Amendment: &quot;Our
view is that the Amendment is either unnecessary or it would seriously
conflict with the current legal notion of parental rights and
responsibilities.&quot;[42] Presumably, parental rights laws are
&quot;unnecessary&quot; in light of Supreme Court cases, which,
if codified, would be somehow radical and dangerous.

<p>

Other opponents go a step further in making explicit the fact
that parental rights laws are incompatible with the &quot;children's
rights&quot; agenda.  Professor Barbara Bennett Woodhouse of 
the University of Pennsylvania has written that the child should
be seen as &quot;having a direct relationship with government
. . . as public resource and public ward, entitled both to make
claims upon the community and to be claimed by the community.&quot;[43]
Prof. Woodhouse believes that focusing on parents' individual
rights &quot;objectifies&quot; children, and that the law should
concentrate on whether parents have &quot;earned&quot; the authority
they exercise over the child.[44]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How might parents &quot;earn&quot; their authority? Perhaps
through government-mandated licensing of parents, as proposed
by Dr. Jack C. Westman, professor of psychiatry at the University
of Wisconsin. &quot;Just as individual responsibility for driving
a car is certified by a driver's license, the individual responsibility
of a parent for child rearing would be certified by a parenting
license.&quot;[45] Requiring parents to obtain a government license
before being allowed to conceive and bear children would complete
the shift from the state acting <I>in loco parentis</I> to the
state <I>as</I> parent. Primary authority over children would
inhere in the state, which would then delegate its authority to
the biological parents of the child -- assuming they pass the
exam.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>Linking Rights and Responsibilities</h3></center>

<p>

If successful, the parental rights movement will provide parents
with greater legal standing to ensure that government respects
their rights through its policies, and, when necessary, in the
courts.  But beyond this immediate, practical benefit, a national
debate on parental rights also has great potential to foster more
parental responsibility.

<p>

The key to encouraging greater parental responsibility is to
explicitly recognize the link between rights and duties upon which
this nation was founded, and to renew our optimism in the ability
of the people to manage their own affairs, as citizens and as
parents.  Indeed, &quot;the most terribly important things must
be left to ordinary men themselves,&quot; including the right
of parents to protect their children from harmful influences and
to direct their children's upbringing.  Recognizing the irreplaceable
role of parents is essential to keeping the power of the state
in check, revitalizing citizenship, and ensuring that children
receive the love, protection and guidance only a parent can provide.

<li>&quot;Formal high school education
beyond the eighth grade is contrary to Amish beliefs, not only
because it places Amish children in an environment hostile to
Amish beliefs with increasing emphasis on competition in class
work and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles, manners,
and ways of the peer group, but also because it takes them away
from their community, physically and emotionally, during the crucial
and formative adolescent period of life. . . . Amish society emphasizes
informal learning-though-doing; a life of 'goodness,'
rather than a life of intellect; wisdom, rather than technical
knowledge; community welfare, rather than competition; and separation
from, rather than integration with, contemporary worldly society.&quot;

Where the child is mature enough to express potentially conflicting
desires, it would be an invasion of the child's rights to permit
such an imposition without canvassing his views.  And, if an Amish
child desires to attend high school, and is mature enough to have
that desire respected, the State may well be able to override
the parents' religiously motivated objections.&quot; <I>Yoder</I>,

<title>SPARE THE ROD? NEW RESEARCH CHALLENGES SPANKING CRITICS</title>

<h1>Spare the Rod?</h1>
<h2><i>New Research Challenges Spanking Critics</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>pposition to parents spanking their children has been 
growing significantly in elite circles over the past 15 years.[1] No doubt
much of this opposition springs from a sincere concern for the
well-being of children. Child abuse is a reality, and stories
of child abuse are horrifying. But while loving and effective
discipline is quite definitely <I>not</I> harsh and abusive, neither
is it weak and ineffectual. Indeed, disciplinary spanking can
fall well within the boundaries of loving discipline and need
not be labeled abusive violence.[2]

<p>

Or so most Americans seem to think.  According to a recent
Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family Research
Council, 76 percent of the more than 1,000 Americans surveyed
said that spanking was an effective form of discipline in their
home when they were children.[3] These results are made all the
more impressive by the fact that nearly half of those who answered
otherwise grew up in homes in which they were never spanked.
Taken together, more than four out of five Americans who were
actually spanked by their parents as children say that it was
an effective form of discipline.

<p>

In addition, Americans perceive lack of discipline to be
the biggest problem in public education today, according to a
recent Gallup poll.[4] Several studies show strong public support
for corporal punishment by parents.[5]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Critics claim that spanking a child is abusive and contributes
to adult dysfunction.  These allegations arise from studies that
fail to distinguish appropriate spanking from other forms of punishment.
Abusive forms of physical punishment such as kicking, punching,
and beating are commonly grouped with mild spanking.  Furthermore,
the studies usually include, and even emphasize, corporal punishment
of adolescents, rather than focusing on preschool children, where
spanking is more effective.  This blurring of distinctions between
spanking and physical abuse, and between children of different
ages, gives critics the illusion of having data condemning all
disciplinary spanking.

<p>

There are several arguments commonly leveled against disciplinary
spanking.  Interestingly, most of these arguments can be used
against other forms of discipline.  Any form of discipline (time-out,
restriction, etc.), when used inappropriately and in anger, can
result in distorting a child's perception of justice and harming
his emotional development.  In light of this, let us examine
some of the unfounded arguments promoted by spanking opponents.

<p>

<b>Argument #1:</b> <i>Many psychological studies show that spanking
is an improper form of discipline.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Researchers John Lyons, Rachel Anderson
and David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research
recently conducted a systematic review of the research literature
on corporal punishment.[6] They found that 83 percent of the 132
identified articles published in clinical and psychosocial journals
were merely opinion-driven editorials, reviews or commentaries,
devoid of new empirical findings.  Moreover, most of the empirical
studies were methodologically flawed by grouping the impact of
abuse with spanking.  The best studies demonstrated beneficial,
not detrimental, effects of spanking in certain situations.  Clearly,
there is insufficient evidence to condemn parental spanking and
adequate evidence to justify its proper use.

<p>

<b>Argument #2:</b> <i>Physical punishment establishes the moral
righteousness of hitting other persons who do something which
is regarded as wrong.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The &quot;spanking teaches hitting&quot;
belief has gained in popularity over the past decade, but is not
supported by objective evidence.  A distinction must be made between
abusive hitting and nonabusive spanking.  A child's ability to
discriminate hitting from disciplinary spanking depends largely
upon the parents' attitude with spanking and the parents' procedure
for spanking.  There is no evidence in the medical literature
that a mild spank to the buttocks of a disobedient child by a
loving parent teaches the child aggressive behavior.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The critical issue is<br>
how spanking is used<br>
more than whether it<br>
is used.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The critical issue is <I>how</I> spanking (or, in fact, any
punishment) is used more so than <I>whether</I> it is used.  Physical
abuse by an angry, uncontrolled parent will leave lasting emotional
wounds and cultivate bitterness and resentment within a child.
The balanced, prudent use of disciplinary spanking, however,
is an effective deterrent to aggressive behavior with some children.

<p>

Researchers at the Center for Family Research at Iowa State
University studied 332 families to examine both the impact of
corporal punishment and the quality of parental involvement on
three adolescent outcomes -- aggressiveness, delinquency, and
psychological well-being.  The researchers found a strong association
between the quality of parenting and each of these three outcomes.
Corporal  punishment, however, was <I>not</I> adversely related
to any of these outcomes.  This study proves the point that quality
of parenting is the chief determinant of favorable or unfavorable
outcomes.[7] Remarkably, childhood aggressiveness has been more
closely linked to maternal permissiveness and negative criticism
than to even abusive physical discipline.[8]

<p>

It is unrealistic to expect that children would never hit
others if their parents would only exclude spanking from their
discipline options.  Most children in their toddler years (long
before they are ever spanked) naturally attempt to hit others
when conflict or frustration arises.  The continuation of this
behavior is largely determined by how the parent or caregiver
responds. If correctly disciplined, the hitting will become less
frequent. If ignored or ineffectively disciplined, the hitting
will likely persist and even escalate.  Thus, instead of contributing
to greater violence, spanking can be a useful component in an
overall plan to effectively teach a child to stop aggressive hitting.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #3:</b> <i>Since parents often refrain from hitting
until the anger or frustration reaches a certain point, the child
learns that anger and frustration justify the use of physical
force.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> A study published in <I>Pediatrics</I> indicates
that most parents who spank do not spank on impulse, but purposefully
spank their children with a belief in its effectiveness.[9] Furthermore,
the study revealed no significant correlation between the frequency
of spanking and the anger reported by mothers.  Actually, the
mothers who reported being angry were not the same parents who
spanked.

<p>

Reactive, impulsive hitting after losing control due to anger
is unquestionably the wrong way for a parent to use corporal punishment.
Eliminating all physical punishment in the home, however, would
not remedy such explosive scenarios.  It could even increase the
problem.  When effective spanking is removed from a parent's disciplinary
repertoire, he or she is left with nagging, begging, belittling,
and yelling, once the primary disciplinary measures -- such as time-out
and logical consequences -- have failed.  By contrast, if proper
spanking is proactively used in conjunction with other disciplinary
measures, better control of the particularly defiant child can
be achieved, and moments of exasperation are less likely to occur.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #4:</b> <i>Physical punishment is harmful to a child.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Any disciplinary measure, physical, verbal
or emotional, carried to an extreme can harm a child.  Excessive
scolding and berating of a child by a parent is emotionally harmful.
Excessive use of isolation (time-out) for unreasonable periods
of time can humiliate a child and ruin the measure's effectiveness.
Obviously, excessive or indiscriminate physical punishment is
harmful and abusive.  However, an appropriately-administered spanking
of a forewarned disobedient child is not harmful when administered
in a loving controlled manner.

<p>

Without the prudent use of spanking for the particularly
defiant child, a parent runs the risk of being inconsistent and
rationalizing the child's behavior.  This inconsistent manner
of  parenting is confusing and harmful to the child and is damaging
to the parent-child relationship.  There is no evidence that proper
disciplinary spanking is harmful to the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #5:</b> <i>Physical punishment makes the child angry
at the parent.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All forms of punishment initially elicit
a frustrated, angry response from a child.  Progression of this
anger is dependent primarily upon the parent's attitude during
and after the disciplinary event, and the manner of its application.
Any form of punishment administered angrily for purposes of retribution,
rather than calmly for purposes of correction, can create anger
and resentment in a child.  Actually, a spanking can break the
escalating rage of a rebellious child and more quickly restore
the relationship between parent and child.

<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #6:</b> <i>Spanking teaches a child that &quot;might
makes right,&quot; that power and strength are most important
and that the biggest can force their will upon the smallest.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Parental power is commonly exerted in routine
child rearing and spanking is only one example.  Other situations
where power and restraint are exercised by the average parent
include:

<p><ul>

<li>The young child who insists on running from his parent in
a busy mall or parking lot.

<p>

<li>The toddler who refuses to sit in his car seat.

<p>

<li>The young patient who refuses to hold still as a vaccination
is administered, or as a laceration is repaired.

</ul><p>

Power and control over the child are necessary at times to
ensure safety, health and proper behavior. Classic child rearing
studies have shown that some degree of power, assertion,[10] and firm
control[11] is essential for optimal child rearing. When power is
exerted in the context of love and for the child's benefit, the
child will not perceive it as bullying or demeaning.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>Distinguishing Spanking from Abuse</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>orporal punishment is often defined broadly as 
<i>bodily punishment of any kind.</i> Since this definition includes 
spanking as well as obviously abusive acts such as kicking, punching, 
beating, face slapping, and even starvation, more specific definitions
must be used to separate appropriate versus inappropriate corporal
punishment.

<p>

Spanking is one of many disciplinary responses available
to parents intended to shape appropriate behavior in the developing
toddler and child.  It is an adjunctive corrective measure, to
be used in combination with primary responses such as restraint,
natural and logical consequences, time-out, and restriction of
privileges.

<p>

Child development experts believe spanking should be used
mainly as a back-up to primary measures, and then independently
to correct deliberate and persistent problem behavior that is
not remedied with milder measures.  It is most useful with toddlers
and preschoolers from 18 months to 6 years of age, when reasoning
is less persuasive.

<p>

Moreover, child development experts say that spanking should
always be a planned action by a parent, not an impulsive reaction
to misbehavior.  The child should be forewarned of the spanking
consequence for each of the designated problem behaviors.  Spanking
should always be administered in private. It should consist of
one or two spanks to the child's buttocks, followed by a calm
review of the offense and the desired behavior.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Argument #7:</b> <i>Spanking is violence.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Spanking, as recommended by most primary
care physicians,[12] is not violence by definition (&quot;exertion
of physical force so as to injure or abuse&quot;).[13] Parents who
properly spank do not injure or abuse their child.

<p>

The use of this term &quot;violence&quot; in the spanking
debate only serves to deepen the confusion.  Why do anti-spanking
authors repeatedly fail to distinguish between abusive violence
and mild spanking?  The distinction is so fundamental and obvious
that its omission suggests that these authors use such terminology
for its propaganda value, not to clarify issues.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #8:</b> <i>Spanking is an ineffective solution to
misbehavior.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Though the specific use of appropriate spanking
has rarely been studied, there is evidence of its short-term and
long-term effectiveness. When combined with reasoning, the use
of negative consequences (including spanking) does effectively
decrease the frequency of misbehavior recurrences with preschool
children.[14] In clinical field trials where parental spanking has
been studied, it has consistently been found to reduce the subsequent
frequency of noncompliance with time-out.[15] Spanking, as a effective
enforcer of time-out, is a component of several well-researched
parent training programs[16] and popular parenting texts.[17]

<p>

Dr. Diana Baumrind of the Institute for Human Development
at the University of California-Berkeley, conducted a decade-long
study of families with children 3 to 9 years old.[18]
Baumrind found that parents employing a balanced disciplinary
style of firm control (including spanking) and positive encouragement
experienced the most favorable outcome in their children. Parents
taking extreme approaches to discipline (authoritarian-types using
excessive punishment with less encouragement or permissive-types
using little punishment and no spanking) were less successful.

<p>

Baumrind concluded that evidence from this study &quot;did
not indicate that negative reinforcement or corporal punishment
per se were harmful or ineffective procedures, but rather the
total patterns of parental control determined the effects on the
child of these procedures.&quot;

<p>

This approach of balanced parenting, employing the occasional
use of spanking, is advocated by several child rearing experts.[19]
In the hands of loving parents, a spanking to the buttocks of
a defiant toddler in appropriate settings is a powerful motivator
to correct behavior and an effective deterrent to disobedience.

<p>

<b>Argument #9:</b> <i>Adults who were spanked as children are
at risk for using violence as a means of resolving conflicts as
adults.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> This theory comes from work done by Murray
Straus of the Family Research Lab at the University of New Hampshire.
Straus' conclusions are based upon theoretical models and survey
results of adults recalling spankings as teenagers. His work
is not clinical research, and many experts believe that his conclusions
go far beyond his data.  As with most of Straus' survey research,
teenage spanking is the focus, not the selective use of spanking
of young children by reasonable parents. The evidence for his
conclusion disappears when parental spanking is measured between
the ages of 2 and 8 years, and when childhood aggression is measured
at a later age.

In a 1994 review article on corporal punishment, Dr. Robert
E. Larzelere, a director of research at Boys Town, Nebraska, presents
evidence supporting a parent's selective use of spanking of children,
particularly those 2 to 6 years old.[20] After thoroughly reviewing
the literature, Larzelere concludes that any association between
spanking and antisocial aggressiveness in children is insignificant
and artifactual.

<p>

After a decade of longitudinal study of children beginning
in third grade, Dr. Leonard Eron found no association between
punishment (including spanking) and later aggression.  Eron, a
clinical psychologist at the Univeristy of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, concluded, &quot;Upon follow-up 10 years
after the original data collection, we found that punishment of
aggressive acts at the earlier age was no longer related to current
aggression, and instead, other variables like parental nurturance
and children's identification with their parents were more important
in predicting later aggression.&quot;[21]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Again, it is the total pattern of parenting that determines the
outcome of a parent's efforts.

<p>

<b>Argument #10:</b> <i>Spanking leads a parent to use harmful
forms of corporal punishment which lead to physical child abuse.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The abuse potential when loving parents
use appropriate disciplinary spanking is very low.  Since parents
have a natural affection for their children, they are more prone
to underutilize spanking than to overutilize it.  Both empirical
data and professional opinion oppose the concept of a causal relationship
between spanking and child abuse.

<p>

Surveys indicate that 70 to 90 percent of parents of preschoolers
use spanking,[22] yet the incidence of physical child abuse in
America is only about 5 percent. Statistically, the two practices
are far apart. Furthermore, over the past decade reports of child
abuse have steadily risen while approval for parental spanking
has steadily declined.[23]

<p>

More than 70 percent of primary care pediatricians reject
the idea that spanking sets the stage for parents to engage in
forms of physical abuse.[24]

<p>

Teaching parents appropriate spanking may actually reduce
child abuse, according to Larzelere, in his 1994 review article
on corporal punishment.[25] Parents who are ill-equipped to control
their child's behavior, or who take a more permissive approach
(refusing to use spanking), may be more prone to anger[26] and explosive
attacks on their child.[27]

<p>

Parental child abuse is an interactive process involving
parental competence, parental and child temperaments, and situational
demands.[28] Abusive parents are more angry, depressed and impulsive,
and emphasize punishment as the predominant means of discipline.
Abused children are more aggressive and less compliant than children
from nonabusive families. There is less interaction between family
members in abusive families and abusive mothers display more negative
than positive behavior. The etiology of abusive parenting is
multifactorial with emphasis on the personalities involved, and
cannot be simply explained by a parent's use of spanking.

<p>

In a letter to the editor in a 1995 issue of <I>Pediatrics</I>,
Drs. Lawrence S. Wissow and Debra Roter of Johns Hopkins University's
pediatrics department acknowledge that a definitive link between
spanking and child abuse has yet to be established.[29]

<p>

Finally, the Swedish experiment to reduce child abuse by
banning spanking seems to be failing.  In 1980, one year after
this ban was adopted, the rate of child beatings was twice that
of the United States.[30] According to a 1995 report from the government
organization Statistics Sweden, police reports of child abuse
by family members rose four-fold from 1984 to 1994, while reports
of teen violence increased nearly six-fold.[31]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Most experts agree that spanking and child abuse are not
on the same continuum, but are very different entities.  With
parenting, it is the &quot;user&quot; and <I>how</I> a measure
is used much more than the measure used that determines the outcome
of the disciplinary effort.  Clearly, spanking can be safely used
in the discipline of young children with an excellent outcome.
The proper use of spanking may actually reduce a parent's risk
of abusing the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #11:</b> <i>Spanking is never necessary.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All children need a combination of encouragement
and correction as they are disciplined to become socially responsible
individuals. In order for correction to deter disobedient behavior,
the consequence imposed upon the child must outweigh the pleasure
of the disobedient act. For very compliant children, milder forms
of correction will suffice and spanking may never be necessary.
For more defiant children who refuse to comply with or be persuaded
by milder consequences such as time-out, spanking is useful, effective,
and appropriate.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The subject of disciplinary spanking should be evaluated
from a factual and philosophical perspective. It must be distinguished
from abusive, harmful forms of corporal punishment. Appropriate
disciplinary spanking can play an important role in optimal child
development, and has been found in prospective studies to be a
part of the parenting style associated with the best outcomes.
There is no evidence that mild spanking is harmful. Indeed,
spanking is supported by history, research, and a majority of
primary care physicians.

<h2>Guidelines for Disciplinary Spanking</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he following are guidelines that Dr. Den Trumball 
has used to advise the parents he serves in disciplining children. 
These guidelines should help policymakers appreciate the legitimacy
of disciplinary spanking.

<p>

1. Spanking should be used selectively for clear, deliberate
misbehavior, particularly that which arises from a child's persistent
defiance of a parent's instruction.  It should be used only when
the child receives at least as much encouragement and praise for
good behavior as correction for problem behavior.

<p>

2. Milder forms of discipline, such as verbal correction,
time-out, and logical consequences, should be used initially,
followed by spanking when noncompliance persists.  Spanking has
shown to be an effective method of enforcing time-out with the
child who refuses to comply.

<p>

3. Only a parent (or in exceptional situations, someone else
who has an intimate relationship of authority with the child)
should administer a spanking.

<p>

4. Spanking should not be administered on impulse or when a parent
is out of control.  A spanking should always be motivated by love
for the purpose of teaching and correcting, never for revenge.

<p>

5. Spanking is inappropriate before 15 months of age and is usually
not necessary until after 18 months.  It should be less necessary
after 6 years, and rarely, if ever, used after 10 years of age.

<p>

6. After 10 months of age, one slap to the hand of a stubborn
crawler or toddler may be necessary to stop serious misbehavior
when distraction and removal have failed.  This is particularly
the case when the forbidden object is immovable and dangerous,
such as a hot oven door or an electrical outlet.

<p>

7. Spanking should always be a planned action, not a reaction,
by the parent and should follow a deliberate procedure.

<p><ul>

<li>The child should be forewarned of the spanking consequence
for designated problem behaviors.

<p>

<li>Spanking should always be administered in private (bedroom
or restroom) to avoid public humiliation or embarassment.

<p>

<li>One or two spanks should be administered to the buttocks.
This is followed by embracing the child and calmly reviewing
the offense and the desired behavior in an effort to reestablish
a warm relationship.

</ul><p>

8. Spanking should leave only transient redness of the skin and
should never cause physical injury.

<p>

9. If properly administered spankings are ineffective, other
appropriate disciplinary responses should be tried, or the parent
should seek professional help. Parents should never increase
the intensity of spankings.

<P>
Ronald W. ROSENBERGER, et al., Petitioners v.
<P>
RECTOR AND VISITORS OF the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA et al.
<P>
No. 94-329.
<P>
Supreme Court of the United States
<P>
Argued March 1, 1995.
<P>
Decided June 29, 1995.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2511
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes
payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors
for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by
student groups called &quot;Contracted Independent Organizations&quot;
(CIOs). The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees
and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student
activities related to the University's educational purpose. CIOs
must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written
materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the
University and that the University is not responsible for them.
The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer
on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely
because its student newspaper, Wide Awake:
<P>
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, *2512 &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality,&quot; as prohibited by the University's
SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment
violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
<P>
After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University,
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation
of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated
the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was
justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
Held:
<P>
1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their
right of free speech. Pp. 2516-2520.
<P>
(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47,
103 S.Ct. 948, 955-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794. In determining whether
a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has
set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech
there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957,
this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand,
content discrimination-- i.e., discrimination against speech because
of its subject matter--which may be permissible if it preserves
the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination--i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective--which is
presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise
within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46, 103 S.Ct., at
955. The most recent and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's
Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 124 L.Ed.2d 352, in which the Court
held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation
of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious
standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here,
as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted
as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible
line-drawing based on content:
<P>
By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does
not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored
treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints. Pp. 2516-2518.
<P>
(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds
rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may
regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when
it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233;
<P>
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278,
70 L.Ed.2d 440, the University may not discriminate based on the
viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan
v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548, 103
S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 76 L.Ed.2d 129. Its argument that the scarcity
of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong. Pp. 2518-2520.
<P>
(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term &quot;promotes&quot;
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic
position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or
ultimate reality, while the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing
the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality.
It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would
be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection
to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. 2519-2520.
<P>
2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying
with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2525.
<P>
(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs
in *2513 the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee
of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows
neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to
recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints,
<P>
including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed.
of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481,
2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546. There is no suggestion that the University
created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause.
The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support
various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers,
in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.
The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do
not make third-party payments on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot;
and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial
viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a &quot;student
... communications ... grou[p].&quot; Neutrality is also apparent
in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The program's
neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied
for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which
would violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2523.
<P>
(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer
v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow
directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue. A public
university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants
access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide
spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would
use the facilities for devotional exercises. See e.g., Widmar,
454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities is paid out
of a student activities fund to which students are required to
contribute. Id., at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272. There is no difference
in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional
significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to
which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor
to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved
here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum
of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the
University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing
the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious
message. Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the
Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision
of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis. Pp. 2523-2525.

Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth
for which it is named and thus bound by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for
the printing costs of a variety of student publications. It withheld
any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; That the paper did promote or manifest views within
the defined exclusion seems plain enough. The challenge is to
the University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the
case raising issues under the Speech and Establishment Clauses
of the First Amendment.

The public corporation we refer to as the &quot;University&quot;
is denominated by state law as &quot;the Rector and Visitors of
the University of Virginia,&quot; Va.Code Ann. Sec. 23-69 (1993),
and it is responsible for governing the school, see Secs. 23-69
to 23-80. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him,
together with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence
and of the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Sec.
57-1, as one of his proudest achievements, the University is among
the Nation's oldest and most respected seats of higher learning.
It has more than 11,000 undergraduate students, and 6,000 graduate
and professional students. An understanding of the case requires
a somewhat detailed description of the program the University
created to support extracurricular student activities on its campus.
<P>
Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its outside
contractors for payment by the fund described below, it must become
a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot; (CIO). CIO status
is available to any group the majority of whose members are students,
whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that complies
with certain procedural requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.
A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must pledge
not to discriminate in its membership; and must include in dealings
with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer,
stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that
the University is not responsible for the CIO. App. 27-28. CIOs
enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms
and computer terminals. Id., at 30. A standard agreement signed
between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits
and opportunities afforded to CIOs &quot;should not be misinterpreted
as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled
by the University, that the University is responsible for the
organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the
University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.&quot;
Id., at 26.
<P>
All CIOs may exist and operate at the University, but some are
also entitled to apply for funds from the Student Activities Fund
(SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the
purpose of the SAF is to support a broad range of extracurricular
student activities that &quot;are related to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is
based on the University's &quot;recogni[tion] that the availability
of a wide range of opportunities&quot; for its students &quot;tends
to enhance the University environment.&quot; App. 26. The Guidelines
require that it be administered &quot;in a manner consistent with
the educational purpose of the University as well as with state
and federal law.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives
its money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to
each full-time student. The Student Council, elected by the students,
has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions
are subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee
of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Cf. id., at 63a-64a.
<P>
Some, but not all, CIOs may submit disbursement requests to the
SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories of student groups
that may seek payment to third-party contractors because they
&quot;are related to the educational purpose of the University
of Virginia.&quot; Id., at 61a-62a. One of these is &quot;student
news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications
media groups.&quot;
<P>
Id., at 61a. The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs
of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for
funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activities
which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,
philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,
activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt status,
those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social
entertainment or related expenses. Id., at 62a-63a. The prohibition
on &quot;political activities&quot; is defined so that it is limited
to electioneering and lobbying. The Guidelines provide that &quot;[t]hese
restrictions on funding political activities are not intended
to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization
which ... espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints,
including those that may be *2515 unpopular or are not generally
accepted.&quot; Id., at 65a-66a. A &quot;religious activity,&quot;
by contrast, is defined as any activity that &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; Id., at 66a.
<P>
The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining the amounts
of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on behalf of
each eligible student organization: the size of the group, its
financial self-sufficiency, and the University-wide benefit of
its activities. If an organization seeks SAF support, it must
submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the organization's
creditors upon determining that the expenses are appropriate.
No direct payments are made to the student groups. During the
1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIOs.
One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the SAF,
and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups were funded as
&quot;student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic
communications media groups.&quot;
<P>
Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), qualified
as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other undergraduates
in 1990, WAP was established &quot;[t]o publish a magazine of
philosophical and religious expression,&quot; &quot;[t]o facilitate
discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance
of Christian viewpoints,&quot; and &quot;[t]o provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.&quot; App.
67. WAP publishes Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University
of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from
the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal &quot;offers
a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues,
especially those relevant to college students at the University
of Virginia.&quot; App. 45. The editors committed the paper to
a two-fold mission: &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage
students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
means.&quot; Ibid. The first issue had articles about racism,
crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil
and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two
issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian
missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors. Each page of Wide Awake,
and the end of each article or review, is marked by a cross. The
advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the Christian
perspective of the journal. For the most part, the advertisers
are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores.
By June 1992, WAP had distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake
to University students, free of charge.
<P>
WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This
is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a
&quot;religious organization,&quot; WAP would not have been accorded
CIO status. As defined by the Guidelines, a &quot;religious organization&quot;
is &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University
contended that WAP is such an organization.
<P>
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF
to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of printing its newspaper.
The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's
request on the ground that Wide Awake was a &quot;religious activity&quot;
within the meaning of the Guidelines, i.e., that the newspaper
&quot;promote[d] or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; Ibid. It made its determination
after examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial
to the full Stud ent Council, contending that WAP met all the
applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis
of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.
The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed
to the next level, the Student Activities Committee. In a letter
signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial
of funding. App. 55.
<P>
Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP,
Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in
*2516 the United States District Court for the Western District
of Virginia, challenging the SAF's action as violative of Rev.Stat.
Sec. 1979, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize
payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the
basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights
to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise of religion,
and to equal protection of the law. They relied also upon Article
I of the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs. 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp.1994), but
did not pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages
for the costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory
relief, and attorney's fees.
<P>
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled
for the University, holding that denial of SAF support was not
an impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against petitioners'
speech, and that the University's Establishment Clause concern
over its &quot;religious activities&quot; was a sufficient justification
for denying payment to third-party contractors. The court did
not issue a definitive ruling on whether reimbursement, had it
been made here, would or would not have violated the Establishment
Clause. 795 F.Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va.1992).
<P>
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guidelines
did discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that, while
the State need not underwrite speech, there was a presumptive
violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was
invoked to deny third-party payment otherwise available to CIOs.
18 F.3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the District Court nonetheless, concluding that the
discrimination by the University was justified by the &quot;compelling
interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state.&quot;
Id., at 281.
<P>

<P>
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based
on its substantive content or the message it conveys. Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33
L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Other principles follow from this precept.
In the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation
may not favor one speaker over another. City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2128,
80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of
its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458-2459,
129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). These rules informed our determination
that the government offends the First Amendment when it imposes
financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of
their expression. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 507-508,
116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). When the government targets not subject
matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the
violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. See
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 S.Ct. 2538, ----, 120
L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious
form of content discrimination. The government must abstain from
regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the
opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the
restriction. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
<P>
These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from
exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public
forum is one of its own creation. In a case involving a school
district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we
declared that &quot;[t]here is no question that the District,
like the private owner of property, may legally preserve the property
under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.&quot;
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).
The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate
purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving
it for certain groups or for the discussion *2517 of certain topics.
See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,
473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985);
Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. Once it has
opened a limited forum, however, the State must respect the lawful
boundaries it has itself set. The State may not exclude speech
where its distinction is not &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum,&quot; Cornelius, supra, at 804-806,
105 S.Ct. at 3450-51; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46,
49, 103 S.Ct., at 955, 957, nor may it discriminate against speech
on the basis of its viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2147; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103
S.Ct., at 955; R.A.V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393, 112 S.Ct.,
at ---- - ----, ---- - ----; cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397,
414-415, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits
of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of
speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between,
on the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible
if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the
other hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible
when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations.
See Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955.
<P>
The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or
geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable. See,
e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47, 103 S.Ct., at 955-956
(forum analysis of a school mail system); Cornelius, supra, at
801, 105 S.Ct., at 3448 (forum analysis of charitable contribution
program). The most recent and most apposite case is our decision
in Lamb's Chapel, supra. There, a school district had opened school
facilities for use after school hours by community groups for
a wide variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. The
district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening
facilities to groups for religious purposes. Invoking its policy,
the district rejected a request from a group desiring to show
a film series addressing various child-rearing questions from
a &quot;Christian perspective.&quot; There was no indication in
the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the school
facilities was &quot;denied for any reason other than the fact
that the presentation would have been from a religious perspective.&quot;
508 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2145. Our conclusion was
unanimous: &quot;[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint
to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all
views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing
with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.&quot; Ibid.
<P>
The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our precedents)
that &quot;ideologically driven attempts to suppress a particular
point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in funding, as
in other contexts,&quot; but insists that this case does not present
that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on content,
not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10. As we have noted,
discrimination against one set of views or ideas is but a subset
or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content
discrimination.
<P>
See, e.g., R.A.V., supra, at 391, 112 S.Ct., at ----. And, it
must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise one. It
is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious
thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a
comprehensive body of thought. The nature of our origins and destiny
and their dependence upon the existence of a divine being have
been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human history.
We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel, viewpoint
discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's
objections to Wide Awake. By the very terms of the SAF prohibition,
the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but
selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts
with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area
of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise,
a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may
be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the
general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party
payments, for the subjects discussed were *2518 otherwise within
the approved category of publications.
<P>
The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs
because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of
viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate
is bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response
to religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted
nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description
of the marketplace of ideas. If the topic of debate is, for example,
racism, then exclusion of several views on that problem is just
as offensive to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one.
It is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic
perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other,
or yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint. The dissent's
declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices
are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple
ways.
<P>
The University's denial of WAP's request for third-party payments
in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not
unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in Lamb's
Chapel and that we found invalid. The church group in Lamb's Chapel
would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save
for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just as the school district
in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views of
the group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in this
case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation
to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake reveal an
avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 2515. It bears only
passing mention that the dissent's attempt to distinguish Lamb's
Chapel is entirely without support in the law. Relying on the
transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to argue that we
found viewpoint discrimination in that case because the government
excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed
in the forum there. Post, at 2550-2551, and n. 13. The Court relied
on no such distinction in holding that discriminating against
religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.
There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which, unlike
an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law) that exclusion
or inclusion of other religious or antireligious voices from that
forum had any bearing on its decision.
<P>
The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding
in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision
of funds rather than access to facilities. The University begins
with the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial
discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to
accomplish its educational mission. Citing our decisions in Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991),
Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540,
103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), and Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the University
argues that content-based funding decisions are both inevitable
and lawful. Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding
decisions as well as to those involving access to facilities,
it is urged, its holding &quot;would become a judicial juggernaut,
constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that
schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make
in the allocation of public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents
16.
<P>
To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v.
Vincent, supra. There, in the course of striking down a public
university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school
facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated:
&quot;Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic
judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources.&quot; 454
U.S., at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277. The quoted language in Widmar
was but a proper recognition of the principle that when the State
is the speaker, it may make content-based choices. When the University
determines the content of the education it provides, it is the
University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate
the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker
or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message.
In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, *2519 supra, we upheld
the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable
to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling.
There, the government did not create a program to encourage private
speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific
information pertaining to its own program. We recognized that
when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular
policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S.,
at 194, 111 S.Ct., at 1773. When the government disburses public
funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it
may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message
is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee. See id., at 196-200,
111 S.Ct., at 1774-1776.
<P>
It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar,
that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University
does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
from private speakers. A holding that the University may not discriminate
based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates
does not restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled
by different principles. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356,
2372, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990); Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,
484 U.S. 260, 270-272, 108 S.Ct. 562, 569-570, 98 L.Ed.2d 592
(1988). For that reason, the University's reliance on Regan v.
Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, is inapposite as
well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant
tax deductions for contributions made to veterans' groups engaged
in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to other charities
which pursued lobbying efforts. Although acknowledging that the
Government is not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental
rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, 103 S.Ct., at 2001, we reaffirmed
the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision
of financial benefits by observing that &quot;[t]he case would
be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its
subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous
ideas,' &quot; see id., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002 (quoting Cammarano
v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S.Ct. 524, 533, 3 L.Ed.2d
462 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513,
519, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Regan relied
on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain speakers--veterans
organizations--and not a distinction based on the content or messages
of those groups' speech. 461 U.S., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002;
cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. The University's
regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction
as its sole rationale and operative principle.
<P>
The distinction between the University's own favored message and
the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.
The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction
in the agreement each CIO must sign. See supra, at 2. The University
declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are
not the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and
are not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party
contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own
messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected
viewpoints.
<P>
The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding
of speech differs from provision of access to facilities because
money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond the fact
that in any given case this proposition might not be true as an
empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could
discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its
availability is wrong as well. The government cannot justify viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of
scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been scarce,
had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision would
have been no different. It would have been incumbent on the State,
of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on some
acceptable neutral principle; but nothing in our decision indicated
that scarcity would give the State the right to *2520 exercise
viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.
<P>
Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to
examine publications to determine whether or not they are based
on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them.
The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling
of individual thought and expression. That danger is especially
real in the University setting, where the State acts against a
background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at
the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See
Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ.
of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683-684, 17 L.Ed.2d

<P>
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211-1212,
1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957). In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered
into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna,
Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous
assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and
to learn. See generally R. Palmer &amp; J. Colton, A History of
the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The quality and creative power
of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure
of a school's influence and attainment. For the University, by
regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its
students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry
in one of the vital centers for the nation's intellectual life,
its college and university campuses.
<P>
The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party contractor
payments on behalf of WAP effects a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry in the context of University sponsored
publications. The prohibition on funding on behalf of publications
that &quot;primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f]
in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; in its ordinary
and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach. The term
&quot;promotes&quot; as used here would comprehend any writing
advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in
a deity or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining &quot;promote&quot; as &quot;to
contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further,
encourage&quot;). And the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable
as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a
deity or ultimate reality. See id., at 1375 (defining &quot;manifest&quot;
as &quot;to show plainly: make palpably evident or certain by
showing or displaying&quot;). Were the prohibition applied with
much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical
student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. And
if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which
primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity
and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx,
Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some
of their major essays excluded from student publications. If any
manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the
writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on
making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point
out their (necessary) imperfections.
<P>
Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the regulation
invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application
to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment. It remains to be considered
whether the violation following from the University's action is
excused by the necessity of complying with the Constitution's
prohibition against state establishment of religion. We turn to
that question.
<P>
III
<P>
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the University had
argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of WAP's
contractors in SAF funding authorization would violate the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, that is *2521 the ground on which the University
prevailed in the Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari on this
question: &quot;Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state
university to exclude an otherwise eligible student publication
from participation in the student activities fund, solely on the
basis of its religious viewpoint, where such exclusion would violate
the Speech and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication
were nonreligious.&quot; Pet. for Cert. i. The University now
seems to have abandoned this position, contending that &quot;[t]he
fundamental objection to petitioners' argument is not that it
implicates the Establishment Clause but that it would defeat the
ability of public education at all levels to control the use of
public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents 29; see id., at 27-29,
and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University itself no
longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is some indication
that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals rested its judgment
on the point and our dissenting colleagues would find it determinative,
it must be addressed.
<P>
The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF support from Wide
Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but
proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by
the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause,
an interest it found compelling. 18 F.3d, at 281. Recognizing
that this Court has regularly &quot;sanctioned awards of direct
nonmonetary benefits to religious groups where the government
has created open fora to which all similarly situated organizations
are invited,&quot; 18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at
277, 102 S.Ct., at 278), the Fourth Circuit asserted that direct
monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects
is &quot;a beast of an entirely different color,&quot; 18 F.3d,
at 286. The court declared that the Establishment Clause would
not permit the use of public funds to support &quot; 'a specifically
religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.'
&quot; Id., at 285 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743,
93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973) (emphasis deleted)).
It reasoned that because Wide Awake is &quot;a journal pervasively
devoted to the discussion and advancement of an avowedly Christian
theological and personal philosophy,&quot; the University's provision
of SAF funds for its publication would &quot;send an unmistakably
clear signal that the University of Virginia supports Christian
values and wishes to promote the wide promulgation of such values.&quot;
18 F.3d, at 286.
<P>
If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause retains
its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was
intended to prohibit, we must in each case inquire first into
the purpose and object of the governmental action in question
and then into the practical details of the program's operation.
Before turning to these matters, however, we can set forth certain
general principles that must bear upon our determination.
<P>
A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor
in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment
Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have decided
a series of cases addressing the receipt of government benefits
where religion or religious views are implicated in some degree.
The first case in our modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence
was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504,
91 L.Ed. 711 (1947). There we cautioned that in enforcing the
prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion,
we must &quot;be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the
government] from extending its general state law benefits to all
its citizens without regard to their religious belief.&quot; Id.,
at 16, 67 S.Ct., at 512. We have held that the guarantee of neutrality
is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral
criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients
whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are
broad and diverse. See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School
Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491, 129
L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (SOUTER, J.) (&quot;[T]he principle is well
grounded in our case law [and] we have frequently relied explicitly
on the general availability of any benefit provided religious
groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges&quot;);
Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 *2522 U.S.
481, 487-488, 106 S.Ct. 748, 751, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 398-399, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 3069, 77 L.Ed.2d
721 (1983); Widmar, 454 U.S., at 274-275, 102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
More than once have we rejected the position that the Establishment
Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal to extend
free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broad-reaching
government programs neutral in design. See Lamb's Chapel, 508
U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147-2148; Mergens, 496 U.S., at
248, 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2370-2371, 2373; Widmar, supra, at 274-275,
102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There
is no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion
or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a
religious cause. The object of the SAF is to open a forum for
speech and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The University's SAF Guidelines have
a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments
on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot; which are those
&quot;whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged
ultimate reality or deity.&quot; Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category
of support here is for &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communications media groups,&quot;
of which Wide Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did
not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;
it sought funding as a student journal, which it was.
<P>
The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from
a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches.
A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to Establishment
Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the Republic.
The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the levying of
taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing
and supporting specific sects. The exaction here, by contrast,
is a student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that
student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of
wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression is
an integral part of the University's educational mission. The
fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether
an objecting student has the First Amendment right to demand a
pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to
which he or she does not subscribe. See Keller v. State Bar of
California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 2237, 110 L.Ed.2d
1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 235-236,
97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977). We must treat it,
then, as an exaction upon the students. But the $14 paid each
semester by the students is not a general tax designed to raise
revenue for the University. See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.
1, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (&quot;A tax, in
the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution,
signifies an exaction for the support of the Government&quot;);
see also Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596, 5 S.Ct. 247,
252, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited
purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one
religion. Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes
to a special fund from which any group of students with CIO status
can draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational
mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech,
withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech,
whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view,
or neither. Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an
expenditure from a general tax fund. Here, the disbursements from
the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that
which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and
effected to provide financial support for a church.
<P>
Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme
in a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical
difference &quot;between government speech endorsing religion,
which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.&quot;
Mergens, supra, *2523 at 250, 110 S.Ct., at 2372 (opinion of O'CONNOR,
J.). In this case, &quot;the government has not willfully fostered
or encouraged&quot; any mistaken impression that the student newspapers
speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, --- L.Ed.2d
---- (slip op., at 10). The University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The Court
of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's religious orientation
would be attributed to the University is not a plausible fear,
and there is no real likelihood that the speech in question is
being either endorsed or coerced by the State, see Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992);
Witters, supra, at 489, 106 S.Ct., at 752-753 (citing Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1367, 79 L.Ed.2d
604 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)); see also Witters, supra,
at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690, 104
S.Ct., at 1368 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)).
<P>
The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract
from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special
Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615,
108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988); Hunt v. McNair,
413 U.S., at 742, 93 S.Ct. at 2874; Tilton, 403 U.S., at 679-680,
91 S.Ct., at 2096; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968).
The error is not in identifying the principle but in believing
that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no different
from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious
exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the
Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before
it, and the dissent would have us do the same. We do not confront
a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian
recipients, the government is making direct money payments to
an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity.
Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes
sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds
flow directly to WAP's coffers.
<P>
It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university
to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis
to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use
meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional
exercises. See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274; Mergens,
496 U.S., at 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2373. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities attributed to
those uses is paid from a student activities fund to which students
are required to contribute. Widmar, supra, at 265, 102 S.Ct.,
at 272. The government usually acts by spending money. Even the
provision of a meeting room, as in Mergens and Widmar, involved
governmental expenditure, if only in the form of electricity and
heating or cooling costs. The error made by the Court of Appeals,
as well as by the dissent, lies in focusing on the money that
is undoubtedly expended by the government, rather than on the
nature of the benefit received by the recipient. If the expenditure
of governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay for
a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used
by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's
Chapel would have to be overruled. Given our holdings in these
cases, it follows that a public university may maintain its own
computer facility and give student groups access to that facility,
including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say
first-come-first-served, basis. If a religious student organization
obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and used a computer
to compose or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a
religious content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing
the group with access would no more violate the Establishment
Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly hall.
See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 *2524 (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens,
supra. There is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference
of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds
to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school
paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. The latter occurs here. The University provides printing
services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as
CIOs by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to
religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular
services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing
is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student life.
<P>
By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a further
degree of separation from the student publication, for it avoids
the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep, repair,
and replacement attributable to student use, and has a clear record
of costs. As a result, and as in Widmar, the University can charge
the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity
in question. It would be formalistic for us to say that the University
must forfeit these advantages and provide the services itself
in order to comply with the Establishment Clause. It is, of course,
true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing
it, and we must guard against this abuse. That is not a danger
here, based on the considerations we have advanced and for the
additional reason that the student publication is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used
in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used
in the University's own regulations. It is instead a publication
involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that
would be both incomplete and chilled were the Constitution to
be interpreted to require that state officials and courts scan
the publication to ferret out views that principally manifest
a belief in a divine being.
<P>
Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the University,
in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to scrutinize the
content of student speech, lest the expression in question--speech
otherwise protected by the Constitution--contain too great a religious
content. The dissent, in fact, anticipates such censorship as
&quot;crucial&quot; in distinguishing between &quot;works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve.&quot; Post,
at 2550. That eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship,
to ensure that all student writings and publications meet some
baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard
on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources
of free speech and expression. As we recognized in Widmar, official
censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment
Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular
printing services on a religion-blind basis.
<P>
&quot;[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [between
'religious' speech and speech 'about' religion] has intelligible
content. There is no indication when 'singing hymns, reading scripture,
and teaching biblical principles' cease to be 'singing, teaching,
and reading'--all apparently forms of 'speech,' despite their
religious subject matter--and become unprotected 'worship.' ...
<P>
&quot;[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principled line,
it is highly doubtful that it would lie within the judicial competence
to administer. Merely to draw the distinction would require the
university--and ultimately the courts--to inquire into the significance
of words and practices to different religious faiths, and in varying
circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably
to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our
cases. E.g., Walz [v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) ].&quot; 454 U.S., at 269-270,
n. 6, 102 S.Ct., at 274, n. 6 (citations omitted).
<P>
* * *
<P>
To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the
University to deny eligibility to student publications because
of their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded of the State by the
separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the
*2525 University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination
inherent in the University's regulation required public officials
to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying
philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief.
That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech
and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion,
which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause
requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's
honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause.
<P>
The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice O'CONNOR, concurring.
<P>
&quot;We have time and again held that the government generally
may not treat people differently based on the God or gods they
worship, or don't worship.&quot; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village
School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2497,
129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). This insistence on government neutrality toward
religion explains why we have held that schools may not discriminate
against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities
that the schools make available to all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct.
269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). Withholding access would leave an
impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:
&quot;the message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;
if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open
to others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility
toward religion.&quot; Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2371,
110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (plurality opinion). &quot;The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they
provide no warrant for discriminating against religion.&quot;
Kiryas Joel, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2498 (O'CONNOR, J.).
Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
As Justice SOUTER demonstrates, however, post, at 2535-2537, there
exists another axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment
Clause. &quot;Public funds may not be used to endorse the religious
message.&quot; Bowen v.
<P>
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 642, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 2592, 101 L.Ed.2d
520 (1988)
<P>
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also id., at 622, 108 S.Ct., at
2581
<P>
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Our cases have permitted some government
funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations.
See, e.g., id., at 617, 108 S.Ct. at 2578 (funding for sex education);
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 741, 96 S.Ct.
2337, 2342, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976)

(cash grant to colleges not to be used for &quot;sectarian purposes&quot;);
Bradfield v.
<P>
Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, 299-300, 20 S.Ct. 121, 124, 44 L.Ed. 168
(1899) (funding of health care for indigent patients). These decisions,
however, provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance
religious activities.
<P>
This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government
neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities.
It is clear that the University has established a generally applicable
program to encourage the free exchange of ideas by its students,
an expressive marketplace that includes some 15 student publications
with predictably divergent viewpoints. It is equally clear that
petitioners' viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide
Awake is a religious activity, under both the University's regulation
and a fair reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide Awake,
according to petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality
by sending a message of hostility toward religion. To finance
Wide Awake, argues the University, violates the prohibition on
direct state funding of religious activities.
<P>
When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably neither
can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical platitudes
is unavailing. Resolution instead depends on the hard task of
judging--sifting through the details and determining whether *2526
the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause. Such
judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine,
based on the particular facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2661, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992)
(&quot;Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing&quot;).
As Justice Holmes observed in a different context: &quot;Neither
are we troubled by the question where to draw the line. That is
the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.
Day and night, youth and age are only types.&quot; Irwin v. Gavit,
268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925) (citation
omitted).

In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S.
481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), for example, we unanimously
held that the State may, through a generally applicable financial
aid program, pay a blind student's tuition at a sectarian theological
institution. The Court so held, however, only after emphasizing
that &quot;vocational assistance provided under the Washington
program is paid directly to the student, who transmits it to the
educational institution of his or her choice.&quot; Id., at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 751. The benefit to religion under the program,
therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her government
paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the conflict between
the neutrality principle and the funding prohibition, not by permitting
one to trump the other, but by relying on the elements of choice
peculiar to the facts of that case: &quot;The aid to religion
at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice. No
reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us
an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice
or belief.&quot; Id., at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 755 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See also Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, ----, 113 S.Ct.
2462, 2467-2468, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).
<P>
The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents itself
even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S.
1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest
exposition of the no-funding principle: &quot;No tax in any amount,
large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities
or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form
they may adopt to teach or practice religion.&quot; Id., at 16,
67 S.Ct., at 512. Yet the Court approved the use of public funds,
in a general program, to reimburse parents for their children's
bus fares to attend Catholic schools. Id., at 17-18, 67 S.Ct.,
at 512-513. Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's
disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at
19, 67 S.Ct., at 513 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (&quot;the most
fitting precedent is that of Julia who, according to Byron's reports,
'whispering &quot;I will ne'er consent,&quot;--consented' &quot;),
the decision reflected the need to rely on careful judgment--not
simple categories--when two principles, of equal historical and
jurisprudential pedigree, come into unavoidable conflict.
<P>
So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not admit
of categorical answers, nor should any be inferred from the Court's
decision today, see ante, at 2521. Instead, certain considerations
specific to the program at issue lead me to conclude that by providing
the same assistance to Wide Awake that it does to other publications,
the University would not be endorsing the magazine's religious
perspective.
<P>
First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence,
remain strictly independent of the University. The University's
agreement with the Contracted Independent Organizations (CIO)--i.e.,
student groups--provides:
<P>
&quot;The University is a Virginia public corporation and the
CIO is not part of that corporation, but rather exists and operates
independently of the University.... The parties understand and
agree that this Agreement is the only source of any control the
University may have over the CIO or its activities....&quot; App.
27.
<P>
And the agreement requires that student organizations include
in every letter, contract, publication, or other written materials
the following disclaimer:
<P>
*2527 &quot;Although this organization has members who are University
of Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the organization is
independent of the corporation which is the University and which
is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions.&quot;
Id., at 28.
<P>
Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publication's
independence from the University. Cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.,
at 274, n. 14, 102 S.Ct., at 276, n. 14.
<P>
Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that ensures
its use only for permissible purposes. A student organization
seeking assistance must submit disbursement requests; if approved,
the funds are paid directly to the third-party vendor and do not
pass through the organization's coffers. This safeguard accompanying
the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication
with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the
funds are used only to further the University's purpose in maintaining
a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from whatever perspective.
This feature also makes this case analogous to a school providing
equal access to a generally available printing press (or other
physical facilities), ante, at 2524, and unlike a block grant
to religious organizations.
<P>
Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in
a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement
of the religious message. Wide Awake does not exist in a vacuum.
It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for advertising
and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of these many
purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the University,
significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one
publication is perceived as endorsed by the University. Besides
the general news publications, for example, the University has
provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor magazine that
has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and Al-Salam,
a publication to &quot;promote a better understanding of Islam
to the University Community,&quot; App. 92. Given this wide array
of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints
in the forum supported by the University, any perception that
the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.
This is not the harder case where religious speech threatens to
dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, ante, --- U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 2451 (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
<P>
Mergens, 496 U.S., at 275, 110 S.Ct., at 2385.
<P>
Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note the
possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a Free Speech
Clause challenge by an objecting student that she should not be
compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees. See, e.g.,
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15, 110 S.Ct. 2228,
2236-2237, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,
431 U.S. 209, 236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).
There currently exists a split in the lower courts as to whether
such a challenge would be successful. Compare Hays County Guardian
v. Supple, 969 F.2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S.
----, 113 S.Ct. 1067, 122 L.Ed.2d 371 (1993); Kania v. Fordham,
702 F.2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students of Univ.
of Wash., 86 Wash.2d 94, 105-106, 542 P.2d 762, 769 (1975) (en
banc), with Smith v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal.4th 843,
863-864, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 194-195, 844 P.2d 500, 513-514, cert.
denied, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 181, 126 L.Ed.2d 140 (1993).
While the Court does not resolve the question here, see ante,
at 2522, the existence of such an opt-out possibility not available
to citizens generally, see Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13, 97 S.Ct.,
at 1811, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment), provides
a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the student fees
in this case from proceeds of the general assessments in support
of religion that lie at the core of the prohibition against religious
funding, see ante, at 2521-2522; post, at 2528-2529 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring); post, at 2535-2537 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and
from government funds generally. Unlike monies dispensed from
state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected
from students who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying
recipients only *2528 from among those who originally paid the
fee. The government neither pays into nor draws from this common
pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting individual
students proportional refunds. The Student Activities Fund, then,
represents not government resources, whether derived from tax
revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that simply
belongs to the students.
<P>
The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets the supremacy
of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of the funding
prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I observed
last Term, &quot;[e]xperience proves that the Establishment Clause,
like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single
test.&quot; Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2499
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
<P>
When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of categorical
obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified
Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified. The
Court today does only what courts must do in many Establishment
Clause cases--focus on specific features of a particular government
action to ensure that it does not violate the Constitution. By
withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides
generally to all other student publications, the University has
discriminated on the basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint
in violation of the Free Speech Clause. And particular features
of the University's program--such as the explicit disclaimer,
the disbursement of funds directly to third-party vendors, the
vigorous nature of the forum at issue, and the possibility for
objecting students to opt out--convince me that providing such
assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible
use of public funds to endorse Wide Awake's religious message.
<P>
Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Justice THOMAS, concurring.
<P>
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but I write
separately to express my disagreement with the historical analysis
put forward by the dissent. Although the dissent starts down the
right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment
Clause, its misleading application of history yields a principle
that is inconsistent with our Nation's long tradition of allowing
religious adherents to participate on equal terms in neutral government
programs.
<P>
Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called &quot;Assessment
Controversy&quot; was indicative of the principles embodied in
the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the dissent's
conclusion that government must actively discriminate against
religion. The dissent's historical discussion glosses over the
fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill that
sparked the controversy: The assessment was to be imposed for
the support of clergy in the performance of their function of
teaching religion. Thus, the &quot;Bill Establishing a Provision
for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; provided for the
collection of a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be
appropriated &quot;by the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each
religious society ... to a provision for a Minister or Teacher
of the Gospel of their denomination, or the providing places of
divine worship, and to none other use whatsoever.&quot; See Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 539, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). (FN1)
<P>
*2529 James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be understood
in this context. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, Madison's
objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the premise that
religious entities may never participate on equal terms in neutral
government programs. Nor did Madison embrace the argument that
forms the linchpin of the dissent: that monetary subsidies are
constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.
Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the neutrality
principle that the dissent inexplicably discards. According to
Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed because it &quot;violate[d]
that equality which ought to be the basis of every law.&quot;
Madison's Remonstrance p 4, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 66,
67 S.Ct., at 536 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). The assessment
violated the &quot;equality&quot; principle not because it allowed
religious groups to participate in a generally available government
program, but because the bill singled out religious entities for
special benefits. See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated
the equality principle &quot;by subjecting some to peculiar burdens&quot;
and &quot;by granting to others peculiar exemptions&quot;).
<P>
Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson
to take from the Assessment Controversy. For some, the experience
in Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the
Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental preferences
for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation
of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23
(1982); Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again:
<P>
A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds
and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L.Rev. 569, 590-591 (1984).
Other commentators have rejected this view, concluding that the
Establishment Clause forbids not only government preferences for
some religious sects over others, but also government preferences
for religion over irreligion. See, e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot;
Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp;
Mary L.Rev. 875, 875 (1986).
<P>
I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the
preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the
fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above. The funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion
of all other Sects.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance p 3, reprinted
in Everson, supra, at 65, 67 S.Ct., at 535-536.
<P>
In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remonstrance,
&quot;Madison's seventh, *2530 ninth, eleventh, and twelfth arguments
all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance, bigotry, unenlightenment,
and persecution that had generally resulted from previous exclusive
religious establishments.&quot; Cord, supra, at 21. The conclusion
that Madison saw the principle of nonestablishment as barring
governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems
especially clear in light of statements he made in the more-relevant
context of the House debates on the First Amendment. See Wallace
v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 98, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 2511, 86 L.Ed.2d
29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (Madison's views &quot;as
reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate]
that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the
establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination
among sects,&quot; but not &quot;as requiring neutrality on the
part of government between religion and irreligion&quot;). Moreover,
even if more extreme notions of the separation of church and state
can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from &quot;arguments
reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the
social contract between government and a civil society,&quot;
Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of nonestablishment
in the Constitution. In any event, the views of one man do not
establish the original understanding of the First Amendment.
<P>
But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this
case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the
history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that
the Establishment Clause &quot;categorically condemn[s] state
programs directly aiding religious activity&quot; when that aid
is part of a neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries.
Post, at 2539. Even if Madison believed that the principle of
nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial support
for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits specifically
targeting religion), there is no indication that at the time of
the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government
must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them
from more generally available financial subsidies. (FN2)
<P>
In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against
the dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary
Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison prepared
an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican Church.
This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and was
not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version
of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention to declare
that &quot;no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,]
to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges....&quot;
Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May 29-June
12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson &amp;
W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance
stressed that &quot;just government&quot; is &quot;best supported
by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with
the same equal hand which protects his person and his property;
by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering
any Sect to invade those of another.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance
p 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 537; cf.
Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49, 3 L.Ed. 650 (1815) (holding
that the Virginia constitution did not prevent the government
from &quot;aiding the votaries of every sect to ... perform their
own religious duties,&quot; or from &quot;establishing funds for
the support of ministers, for public charities, for the endowment
of churches, or for the sepulture of the dead&quot; *2531 Stripped
of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument is reduced
to the claim that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence permits
neutrality in the context of access to government facilities but
requires discrimination in access to government funds. The dissent
purports to locate the prohibition against &quot;direct public
funding&quot; at the &quot;heart&quot; of the Establishment Clause,
see post, at 2541, but this conclusion fails to confront historical
examples of funding that date back to the time of the founding.
To take but one famous example, both Houses of the First Congress
elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820
ed.); H.R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that
Congress enacted legislation providing for an annual salary of
$500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789,
ch. 17, Sec. 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a member of
the committee that recommended the chaplain system in the House.
See H.R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of Cong. 891 (1789);
<P>
Cord, supra, at 25. This same system of &quot;direct public funding&quot;
of congressional chaplains has &quot;continued without interruption
ever since that early session of Congress.&quot; Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U.S. 783, 788, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3334, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983).
(FN3)
<P>
The historical evidence of government support for religious entities
through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As the dissent
concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies &quot;have
been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests
represented by the Establishment Clause.&quot; Post, at 2542,
n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
676-680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415-1417, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). (FN4)
In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to
rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary aid
to religious groups even when the aid is equally available to
other groups. A tax exemption in many cases is economically and
functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.
(FN5) In *2532 one instance, the government relieves religious
entities (along with others) of a generally applicable tax; in
the other, it relieves religious entities (along with others)
of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning it in the
form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is provided at the
front or back end of the taxation process, the financial aid to
religious groups is undeniable. The analysis under the Establishment
Clause must also be the same: &quot;Few concepts are more deeply
embedded in the fabric of our national life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary
colonial times, than for the government to exercise at the very
least this kind of benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious
exercise....&quot; Walz, supra, at 676-677, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.
<P>
Consistent application of the dissent's &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
would require that &quot; 'a church could not be protected by
the police and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept
in repair.' &quot; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274-275, 102 S.Ct. 269,
277, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981)). The dissent admits that &quot;evenhandedness
may become important to ensuring that religious interests are
not inhibited.&quot; Post, at 2541, n. 5. Surely the dissent must
concede, however, that the same result should obtain whether the
government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing
the costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or
by establishing a public fire department. If churches may benefit
on equal terms with other groups in the latter program--that is,
if a public fire department may extinguish fires at churches--then
they may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.
<P>
Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray,
this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle
that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The
Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from
government benefits programs that are generally available to a
broad class of participants. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d
352 (1993); Zobrest, supra; Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110
L.Ed.2d 191 (1990);
<P>
Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 890, 103
L.Ed.2d 1 (1989); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for
Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983);
Widmar, supra. Under the dissent's view, however, the University
of Virginia may provide neutral access to the University's own
printing press, but it may not provide the same service when the
press is owned by a third party. Not surprisingly, the dissent
offers no logical justification for this conclusion, and none
is evident in the text or original meaning of the First Amendment.
<P>
If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents
benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's
Student Activities Fund, it must also *2533 be offended when they
receive the same benefits in the form of in-kind subsidies. The
constitutional demands of the Establishment Clause may be judged
against either a baseline of &quot;neutrality&quot; or a baseline
of &quot;no aid to religion,&quot; but the appropriate baseline
surely cannot depend on the fortuitous circumstances surrounding
the form of aid. The contrary rule would lead to absurd results
that would jettison centuries of practice respecting the right
of religious adherents to participate on neutral terms in a wide
variety of government-funded programs.
<P>
Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to participate
in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to the class
of &quot;essential public benefits&quot; identified by the dissent.
See post, at 2541, n. 5. A broader tradition can be traced at
least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50.
Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress
had provided: &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge ... being
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools
and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.&quot; Id.,
at 52, n. (a). Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in
the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.
See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, Sec. 1, 2 Stat. 225-226;
Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, Sec. 5, 2 Stat. 279;
<P>
Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14, Sec. 10, 2 Stat. 621; Act of Apr.
18, 1818, ch. 67, Sec. 6, 3 Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch.
126, Sec. 2, 3 Stat. 467.
<P>
Many of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants
undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there
was no requirement that the schools be &quot;public.&quot; See
C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964). Nevertheless, early Congresses found
no problem with the provision of such neutral benefits. See also
id., at 174 (noting that &quot;almost universally[,] Americans
from 1789 to 1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion
and religiously oriented educational institutions&quot;).
<P>
Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been available
to religious adherents on neutral terms. Several examples may
be found in the work of early Congresses, including copyright
protection for &quot;the author and authors of any map, chart,
book or books,&quot; Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, Sec. 1, 1 Stat.
124, 124, and a privilege allowing &quot;every printer of newspapers
[to] send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers
within the United States, free of postage,&quot; Act of Feb. 20,
1792, ch. 7, Sec. 21, 1 Stat. 232, 238. Neither of these laws
made any exclusion for the numerous authors or printers who manifested
a belief in or about a deity.
<P>
Thus, history provides an answer for the constitutional question
posed by this case, but it is not the one given by the dissent.
The dissent identifies no evidence that the Framers intended to
disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms
in evenhanded government programs. The evidence that does exist
points in the opposite direction and provides ample support for
today's decision.
<P>
Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG and
Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
<P>
The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding of
core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does so,
however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar principles
of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment and Speech
Clauses, and by viewing the very funds in question as beyond the
reach of the Establishment Clause's funding restrictions as such.
Because there is no warrant for distinguishing among public funding
sources for purposes of applying the First Amendment's prohibition
of religious establishment, I would hold that the University's
refusal to support petitioners' religious activities is compelled
by the Establishment Clause. I would therefore affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
The central question in this case is whether a grant from the
Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses
*2534 would violate the Establishment Clause. Although the Court
does not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes
something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand
Establishment Clause scrutiny. Although the Court places great
stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious activities
for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that
such evenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy
constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in
a benefit to religion. Ante, at 2521; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Something more is necessary to justify
any religious aid. Some members of the Court, at least, may think
the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect, since the
money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide Awake's own
checking account. The Court's principal reliance, however, is
on an argument that providing religion with economically valuable
services is permissible on the theory that services are economically
indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech
forums, which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would
commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyond anything
justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums. The Court
implicitly recognizes this in its further attempt to circumvent
the clear bar to direct governmental aid to religion. Different
members of the Court seek to avoid this bar in different ways.
The opinion of the Court makes the novel assumption that only
direct aid financed with tax revenue is barred, and draws the
erroneous conclusion that the involuntary Student Activities Fee
is not a tax. I do not read Justice O'CONNOR'S opinion as sharing
that assumption; she places this Student Activities Fund in a
category of student funding enterprises from which religious activities
in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no consequent
endorsement of religion. The resulting decision is in unmistakable
tension with the accepted law that the Court continues to avow.

The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a closer
look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords. The character
of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the opening page of the
first issue, where the editor-in-chief announces Wide Awake's
mission in a letter to the readership signed, &quot;Love in Christ&quot;:
it is &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed,
according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot;
App. 45. The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation,
that &quot;[t]he hour has come for you to awake from your slumber,
because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11.&quot;
<P>
Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on
the editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call to accept salvation:
<P>
&quot;The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and
repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware
of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and
condemn sin, or else they fail in their duty of love.&quot; Mourad
&amp; Prince, A Love/Hate Relationship, November/December 1990,
p. 3.

&quot;When you get to the final gate, the Lord will be handing
out boarding passes, and He will examine your ticket. If, in your
lifetime, you did not request a seat on His Friendly Skies Flyer
by trusting Him and asking Him to be your pilot, then you will
not be on His list of reserved seats (and the Lord will know you
not). You will not be able to buy a ticket then; no amount of
money or desire will do the trick. You will be met by your chosen
pilot and flown straight to Hell on an express jet (without air
conditioning or toilets, of course).&quot; Ace, The Plane Truth,

There is no need to quote further from articles of like tenor,
but one could examine such other examples as religious poetry,
see Macpherson, I Have Started Searching for Angels, November/December
1990, p. 18; religious textual analysis and commentary, see Buterbaugh,
Colossians 1:1-14: Abundant Life, id., at 20; Buterbaugh, John

contemplative questions about biblical texts); Early, Hope and

<P>
Even featured essays on facially secular topics become platforms
from which to call readers to fulfill the tenets of Christianity
in their lives. Although a piece on racism has some general discussion
on the subject, it proceeds beyond even the analysis and interpretation
of biblical texts to conclude with the counsel to take action
because that is the Christian thing to do:
<P>
&quot;God calls us to take the risks of voluntarily stepping out
of our comfort zones and to take joy in the whole richness of
our inheritance in the body of Christ. We must take the love we
receive from God and share it with all peoples of the world.

&quot;Racism is a disease of the heart, soul, and mind, and only

The same progression occurs in an article on eating disorders,
which begins with descriptions of anorexia and bulimia and ends
with this religious message:

&quot;As thinking people who profess a belief in God, we must
grasp firmly the truth, the reality of who we are because of Christ.
Christ is the Bread of Life (John 6:35). Through Him, we are full.
He alone can provide the ultimate source of spiritual fulfillment
which permeates the emotional, psychological, and physical dimensions
of our lives.&quot; Ferguson &amp; Lassiter, From Calorie to Calvary,

This writing is no merely descriptive examination of religious
doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's
social and personal problems. Nor is it merely the expression
of editorial opinion that incidentally coincides with Christian
ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is
straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with
God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral
obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These
are not the words of &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] ...&quot; (in the language
of the University's funding criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a), but the words of &quot;challenge [to] Christians to live,
in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ...
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means&quot;
(in the language of Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject
is not the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room,
but of the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is
nothing other than the preaching of the word, which (along with
the sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer those
called to the religious life.
<P>
Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the
word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause,
and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was
meant to bar this use of public money. Evidence on the subject
antedates even the Bill of Rights itself, as may be seen in the
writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the meaning
of the Establishment Clause is well settled, e.g., Committee for
Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 770,
n. 28, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2964, n. 28, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973); Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 13, 67 S.Ct. 504, 510, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Four years before the First Congress proposed
the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy
of using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial
*2536 and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played
the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment
bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses
stand:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that ... the same authority which can force
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the
support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to
any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?&quot; James Madison,
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments p 3 (hereinafter
Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson, supra, at 65-66
[67 S.Ct., at 524] (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).
<P>
Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony
had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n.
8, 67 S.Ct., at 509, n. 8, the practice having become &quot;so
commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling
of abhorrence,&quot; 330 U.S., at 11, 67 S.Ct., at 509 (footnote
omitted). Madison's Remonstrance captured the colonists' &quot;conviction
that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under
a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support,
or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with
the beliefs of any religious individual or group.&quot; Ibid.
(FN1) Their sentiment as expressed by Madison in Virginia, led
not only *2537 to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill,
but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. That bill's preamble
declared that &quot;to compel a man to furnish contributions of
money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is
sinful and tyrannical,&quot; Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84-85
(P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its text provided
&quot;[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support
any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever....,&quot;
ibid. See generally Everson, supra, at 13, 67 S.Ct., at 510. We
have &quot;previously recognized that the provisions of the First
Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson
played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended
to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion
on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.&quot;
<P>
Ibid.; see also Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion:
A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev.
875, 921, 923 (1986) (&quot;[I]f the debates of the 1780's support
any proposition, it is that the Framers opposed government financial
support for religion.... They did not substitute small taxes for
large taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum. The principle
was what mattered. With respect to money, religion was to be wholly
voluntary. Churches either would support themselves or they would
not, but the government would neither help nor interfere&quot;)
(footnote omitted); T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At
the time of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;);
J. Choper, Securing Religious Liberty 16 (1995) (&quot;There is
broad consensus that a central threat to the religious freedom
of individuals and groups--indeed, in the judgment of many the
most serious infringement upon religious liberty--is posed by
forcing them to pay taxes in support of a religious establishment
or religious activities&quot;) (footnotes omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted). (FN2)
<P>
*2538 The principle against direct funding with public money is
patently violated by the contested use of today's student activity
fee. (FN3) Like today's taxes generally, the fee is Madison's
threepence. The University exercises the power of the State to
compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble, supra, and
the use of any part of it for the direct support of religious
activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly held to be the
heart of the prohibition on establishment. Everson, 330 U.S.,
at 15-16, 67 S.Ct., at 511 (&quot;The 'establishment of religion
clause' ... means at least this.... No tax in any amount, large
or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they
may adopt to teach or practice religion&quot;); see School Dist.
of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 385, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3223,
87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985) (&quot;Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence
is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely

2968 (&quot;In the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing

dissenting) (&quot;The coercion that was a hallmark of historical
establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy

88 S.Ct. 1942, 1954-1955, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968) (holding that
taxpayers have an adequate stake in the outcome of Establishment
Clause litigation to satisfy Article III standing requirements,
after *2539 stating that &quot;[o]ur history vividly illustrates
that one of the specific evils feared by those who drafted the

taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion
over another or to support religion in general&quot;).
<P>
The Court, accordingly, has never before upheld direct state funding
of the sort of proselytizing published in Wide Awake and, in fact,
has categorically condemned state programs directly aiding religious
activity, School Dist. v. Ball, supra, at 395, 105 S.Ct., at 3228-3229
(striking programs providing secular instruction to nonpublic
school students on nonpublic school premises because they are
&quot;indistinguishable from the provision of a direct cash subsidy
to the religious school that is most clearly prohibited under
the Establishment Clause&quot;); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229,
254, 97 S.Ct. 2593, 2608-2609, 53 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (striking
field trip aid program because it constituted &quot;an impermissible
direct aid to sectarian education&quot;); Meek v. Pittenger, 421

Black, and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in

<P>
Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing
both secular and sectarian functions, it has always made a searching
enquiry to ensure that the institution kept the secular activities
separate from its sectarian ones, with any direct aid flowing
only to the former and never the latter. Bowen v. Kendrick, 487
U.S. 589, 614-615, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988)

sexual relations on ground that funds cannot be &quot;used by

(upholding general aid program for construction of academic facilities
as &quot;[t]here is no evidence that religion seeps into the use
of any of these facilities&quot;); see Board of Ed. of Central
School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 244-248, 88 S.Ct. 1923,
1926-1929, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968) (upholding textbook loan program
limited to secular books requested by individual students for
secular educational purposes).
<P>
Reasonable minds may differ over whether the Court reached the
correct result in each of these cases, but their common principle
has never been questioned or repudiated. &quot;Although Establishment
Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause
does absolutely prohibit government-financed ... indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith.&quot; School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223.
<P>
B
<P>
Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts
and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear
constitutional *2540 violation? The answer must be in part that
the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding
section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively
to Wide Awake's &quot;Christian viewpoint,&quot; ante, at 2515,
or its &quot;religious perspective,&quot; ante, at 2518, and in
distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church,
the Court maintains that &quot;[Wide Awake] is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense,&quot; ante, at 2524;
(FN4) see also ante, at 2515. The Court does not quote the magazine's
adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness
of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept
Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual
analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so it is easy for the
Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court
of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly
evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions
to religious points of view.
<P>
Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide
Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently religious
about the magazine to require examination under the Establishment
Clause, and one may therefore ask why the unequivocal prohibition
on direct funding does not lead the Court to conclude that funding
would be unconstitutional. The answer is that the Court focuses
on a subsidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately
misapplies. That subsidiary body of law accounts for the Court's
substantial attention to the fact that the University's funding
scheme is &quot;neutral,&quot; in the formal sense that it makes
funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and sectarian
applicants alike. Ante, at 2521-2522. While this is indeed true
and relevant under our cases, it does not alone satisfy the requirements
of the Establishment Clause, as the Court recognizes when it says
that evenhandedness is only a &quot;significant factor&quot; in
certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a dispositive one.
Ante, at 2521; see ante, at 2521-2522; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id., at 2525 (&quot;Neutrality, in
both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause&quot;);
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, --- U.S.
----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (&quot;the
Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the application
of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously oblivious
to the effects of its actions.... [N]ot all State policies are
permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are
neutral in form&quot;). This recognition reflects the Court's
appreciation of two general rules: that whenever affirmative government
aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires
some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part;
and that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even
if accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at
the very heart of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 2523 (&quot;We
do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that
includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct
money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious
activity&quot;); ante, at 2522, 2523-2524; see also ante, at ----
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;[Our] decisions ... provide
no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious
activities&quot;).
<P>
In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules
but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those
rules in greater detail than the Court does. As the foregoing
quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship
between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of evenhandedness
when affirmative government aid does result in some benefit to
religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal
criterion. *2541 At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands
the prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition
does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of the
Clause's application. Is any government activity that provides
any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional?
Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning churches, wrong
to pay the bus fares of students on the way to parochial schools,
wrong to allow a grantee of special education funds to spend them
at a religious college? These are the questions that call for
drawing lines, and it is in drawing them that evenhandedness becomes
important. However the Court may in the past have phrased its
line-drawing test, the question whether such benefits are provided
on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addresses
one aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with respect
to religion (that is, whether the law either &quot;advance[s]
[or] inhibit[s] religion,&quot; Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592, 109
S.Ct. 3086, 3100, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)). In Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981),
for example, we noted that &quot;[t]he provision of benefits to
[a] broad ... spectrum of [religious and nonreligious] groups
is an important index of secular effect.&quot; See also Board
of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S.
----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).
In the doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding),
where there is initially room for argument about a law's effect,
evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly
advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Evenhandedness
is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into the constitutionality
of a doubtful law, (FN5) but evenhandedness goes no further. It
does not guarantee success under Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen,
463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct.
748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993),
are among the latest of those to illustrate this relevance of
evenhandedness when advancement is not so obvious as to be patently
unconstitutional. Each case involved a program in which benefits
given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately were
used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious
institutions. (FN6)
<P>
In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a
neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program
at issue. Witters, supra, at 487-488, 106 S.Ct., at 751; Mueller,
supra, at 397-399, 103 S.Ct. at 3068-3069; Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2468. But the significance of
evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases,
hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.
Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might
be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.
Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was
the fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious institutions
&quot;only as a result of the genuinely independent and private
choices of aid recipients,&quot; Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct.,
at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;
Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469. In noting
and relying on this particular feature of each of the programs
at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct
funding of religious activities. *2542 See Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469; Witters, supra, at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070. Thus, our holdings in these cases were little more
than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that &quot;a State
may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate
all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without
constitutional barrier....&quot; Witters, supra, at 486-487, 106
S.Ct., at 751. Such &quot;attenuated financial benefit[s], ultimately
controlled by the private choices of individual[s],&quot; we have
found, are simply not within the contemplation of the Establishment
Clause's broad prohibition. Mueller, supra, at 400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070; see also Witters, supra, at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755
(opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). (FN7)
<P>
Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit
is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient condition
of constitutionality for direct financial support of religious
proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated
any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere
prohibition against unequal direct aid. See, e.g., Tilton v. Richardson,
403 U.S., at 682-684, 91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (striking portion
of general aid program providing grants for construction of college
and university facilities to the extent program made possible
the use of funds for sectarian activities); (FN8) Wolman v. Walter,
433 U.S., at 252-255, 97 S.Ct., at 2608-09 (striking funding of
field trips for nonpublic school students, such as are &quot;provided
to public *2543 school students in the district,&quot; because
of unacceptable danger that state funds would be used to foster
religion). And nowhere has the Court's adherence to the preeminence
of the no-direct-funding principle over the principle of evenhandedness
been as clear as in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520.
<P>
Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act
(AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions
for counseling and educational services related to adolescent
sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the litigation, 141 grants
had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular
and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597, 108 S.Ct.,
at 2567-2568. In an Establishment Clause challenge to the Act
brought by taxpayers and other interested parties, the District
Court resolved the case on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment,
holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and
also insofar as religious institutions were involved in receiving
grants under the Act. When this Court reversed on the issue of
facial constitutionality under the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 602-618, 108 S.Ct., at 2570-2579, we said that there was &quot;no
intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees,
religious uses are permitted.&quot; Id., at 614, 108 S.Ct., at
2577. On the contrary, after looking at the legislative history
and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure
that grants would not be &quot;used by ... grantees in such a
way as to advance religion.&quot; Id., at 615, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.
<P>
With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional
as applied, we remanded the case to the District Court &quot;for
consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as
it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently
being administered.&quot; Id., at 621, 108 S.Ct., at 2580.
<P>
Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to &quot;consider
... whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund
'specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially
secular setting.' &quot; Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S.,
at 743, 93 S.Ct., at 2874. In giving additional guidance to the
District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would
be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were
using materials &quot;that have an explicitly religious content
or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious
faith.&quot; Ibid. At no point in our opinion did we suggest that
the breadth of potential recipients, or distribution on an evenhanded
basis, could have justified the use of federal funds for religious
activities, a position that would have made no sense after we
had pegged the Act's facial constitutionality to our conclusion
that advancement of religion was not inevitable. Justice O'CONNOR's
separate opinion in the case underscored just this point: &quot;I
fully agree ... that '[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse
the religious message.' Post, at 642, 108 S.Ct., at 2591-2592
[ (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ].... [A]ny use of public funds to
promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause.&quot;
Id., at 622-623, 108 S.Ct., at 2581-582 (concurring opinion) (emphasis
in original).
<P>
Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Everson v. Board
of Ed., 330 U.S., at 16-18, 67 S.Ct., at 511-513, Board of Ed.
v. Allen, 392 U.S., at 243-249, 88 S.Ct., at 1926-1930, Tilton
v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 678-682, 91 S.Ct., at 2095-2098, Hunt
v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 742-745, 93 S.Ct., at 2873-2875, and Roemer
v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S., at 759-761, 96 S.Ct.,
at 2351-2352. Each of these cases involved a general aid program
that provided benefits to a broad array of secular and sectarian
institutions on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them was that
fact dispositive. The plurality opinion in Roemer made this point
exactly:
<P>
&quot;The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and
a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is
lending direct support to a religious activity. The State may
not, for example, pay for what is actually a religious education,
even though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even
though it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions
alike.&quot; 426 U.S., at 747, 96 S.Ct., at 2345 (opinion of Blackmun,
J.).
<P>
Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aid cases,
as in Bowen, was whether *2544 secular activities could be separated
from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that aid would
flow to the secular alone.
<P>
Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve the standard
thus exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished
the indirect aid in issue from contrasting examples in the line
of cases striking down direct aid, and each thereby expressly
preserved the core constitutional principle that direct aid to
religion is impermissible. See Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger, 421
U.S. 349, 95 S.Ct. 1753, 44 L.Ed.2d 217 and School Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 87 L.Ed.2d 267, and noting that
&quot; '[t]he state may not grant aid to a religious school, whether
cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct
subsidy to the religious school' &quot;) (quoting Witters, 474
U.S., at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751); see also ibid.; Mueller, 463
U.S., at 399, 103 S.Ct., at 3069. It appears that the University
perfectly understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule
over the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short
of funding &quot;any activity which primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;
(FN9) App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
<P>
C
<P>
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of evenhandedness
is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the constitutionality
of providing a government benefit that reaches religion, the Court
must identify some further element in the funding scheme that
does demonstrate its permissibility. For one reason or another,
the Court's chosen element appears to be the fact that under the
University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen
by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
1
<P>
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding
program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and
Zobrest (discussed supra, at 2521-2522), the Court has misread
those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit
religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between
the government and a religious institution. See Witters, 474 U.S.,
at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751; see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400,
103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070; Zobrest, *2545 509 U.S., at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2467-2469. Here there is no third party standing
between the government and the ultimate religious beneficiary
to break the circuit by its independent discretion to put state
money to religious use. The printer, of course, has no option
to take the money and use it to print a secular journal instead
of Wide Awake. It only gets the money because of its contract
to print a message of religious evangelism at the direction of
Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for doing precisely
that. The formalism of distinguishing between payment to Wide
Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment of the approved
bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of Constitutional
law. If this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution
would permit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution;
(FN10) in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence to the
no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand out credit
cards to religious institutions and honor the monthly statements
(so long as someone could devise an evenhanded umbrella to cover
the whole scheme). Witters and the other cases cannot be distinguished
out of existence this way.
<P>
2
<P>
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the
printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On
this purported justification, the payment to the printer is significant
only as the last step in an argument resting on the assumption
that a public university may give a religious group the use of
any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular groups are
likewise eligible. The Court starts with the cases of Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Board
of Ed. of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,
110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), in which religious groups were held to
be entitled to access for speaking in government buildings open
generally for that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability
of a forum has economic value (the government built and maintained
the building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall); and
that economically there is no difference between the University's
provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the
University's printing equipment; and that therefore the University
must be able to provide the use of the latter. Since it may do
that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw
the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what
the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's
own printing equipment. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its
troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon
to support it. The common factual thread running through Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution
created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or
college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude speakers
with religious messages. See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-955,
74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (forum analysis). In each case the restriction
was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate
the content of speech in an open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens)
or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's
Chapel, see infra, at 2550-2551). In each case, to be sure, the
religious speaker's use of the room passed muster as an incident
of a plan to facilitate speech generally for a secular purpose,
entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk
that the religious speech would be taken to be the speech *2546
of the government or that the government's endorsement of a religious
message would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable
Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation
Army, the millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker
in a public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the
model of the street corner that supplied the justification going
beyond the requirement of evenhandedness.
<P>
The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is
ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While they do indeed
allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on the
recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street corner
(even though the State paves the roads and provides police protection
to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between the public
street corner and open classroom space. Thus, the Court found
it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in traditional
speech activities in these forums, too, even though the rooms
(like street corners) require some incidental state spending to
maintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the
cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote them, to cover
more than forums for literal speaking. There is no traditional
street corner printing provided by the government on equal terms
to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to a higher
plane of generalization without admitting that new economic benefits
are being extended directly to religion in clear violation of
the principle barring direct aid. The argument from economic equivalence
thus breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it would
support is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the service
of free speech. Absent that, the rule against direct aid stands
as a bar to printing services as well as printers.
<P>
3
<P>
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads
the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third
attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law,
but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways
that make further affirmative justification unnecessary. Justice
O'CONNOR makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which
the activity fee is assessed and distributed. She concludes that
the funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of governmental
treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's
purview in the absence of a message of religious endorsement (which
she finds not to be present). Ante, at 2526-2528 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring). The opinion of the Court concludes more expansively
that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find
the aid permissible on the legal assumption that the bar against
direct aid applies only to aid derived from tax revenue. I have
already indicated why it is fanciful to treat the fee as anything
but a tax, supra, at 2538, and n. 3; see also ante, at 2522 (noting
mandatory nature of the fee), and will not repeat the point again.
The novelty of the assumption that the direct aid bar only extends
to aid derived from taxation, however, requires some response.
<P>
Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write
in the first instance, the Court has never held that government
resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct religious
support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently
spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues. E.g., School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223 (&quot;Although
Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes,
the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored
indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith&quot;);
Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780, 93 S.Ct., at 2969 (&quot;In the absence
of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived
from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,
and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct
aid in whatever form is invalid&quot;); id., at 772, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2965 (&quot;Primary among those evils&quot; against which the
Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity&quot;) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time
*2547 of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;).
<P>
Allowing non-tax funds to be spent on religion would, in fact,
fly in the face of clear principle. Leaving entirely aside the
question whether public non-tax revenues could ever be used to
finance religion without violating the endorsement test, see Allegheny
County v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at 593-594,
109 S.Ct., at 3100-3101, any such use of them would ignore one
the dual objectives of the Establishment Clause, which was meant
not only to protect individuals and their republics from the destructive
consequences of mixing government and religion, but to protect
religion from a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d
601 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's &quot;first and most immediate
purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion&quot;); Everson,
330 U.S., at 53, 67 S.Ct., at 529-530 (Rutledge, J., dissenting)
(&quot;The great condition of religious liberty is that it be
maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences,
by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation
it vanishes with the resting&quot;) (citing Madison's Remonstrance
pp 7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63-72, 67 S.Ct., at 534-539
(appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)); School Dist. of Abington
v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 259, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1591, 10 L.Ed.2d
844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (&quot;It is not only the
nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and
controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it
is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed
which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the
government&quot;) (footnote omitted); Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution,
at 84-85. Since the corrupting effect of government support does
not turn on whether the Government's own money comes from taxation
or gift or the sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause
could hardly relax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was
not implicated. Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal,
one can only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate
one half of the Establishment Clause's justification.
<P>
D
<P>
Nothing in the Court's opinion would lead me to end this enquiry
into the application of the Establishment Clause any differently
from the way I began it. The Court is ordering an instrumentality
of the State to support religious evangelism with direct funding.
This is a flat violation of the Establishment Clause.
<P>
II
<P>
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause's bar
to funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether
in the absence of this bar the University would violate the Free
Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has done. Widmar, 454
U.S., at 271, 102 S.Ct., at 275 (university's compliance with
its Establishment Clause obligations can be a compelling interest
justifying speech restriction). But the Court's speech analysis
may have independent application, and its flaws should not pass
unremarked.
<P>
The Court acknowledges, ante, at 2518, the necessity for a university
to make judgments based on the content of what may be said or
taught when it decides, in the absence of unlimited amounts of
money or other resources, how to honor its educational responsibilities.
Widmar, supra, at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277-278; cf. Perry, 460 U.S.,
at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957 (subject matter and speaker identity
distinctions &quot;are inherent and inescapable in the process
of limiting a non-public forum to activities compatible with the
intended purpose of the property&quot;). Nor does the Court generally
question that in allocating public funds a state university enjoys
spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 1773, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991)
<P>
(&quot;[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to establish
a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program&quot;);
Regan v. Taxation *2548 with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S.
540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983) (upholding government
subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker). (FN11)
Accordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry in
this case is not merely whether the University bases its funding
decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if there is
an infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision,
it must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing
among competing viewpoints, ante, at 2516-2517, citing, inter
alia, Perry, supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 957; see also Lamb's
Chapel, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2144-2145 (subject matter
distinctions permissible in controlling access to limited public
forum if reasonable and viewpoint neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct.
3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (similar); Regan, supra, at
548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002. (FN12)
<P>
The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not
turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied
to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the
issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is explained
by reference to viewpoint. See Cornelius, supra, at 806, 105 S.Ct.,
at 3439 (&quot;[T]he government violates the First Amendment when
it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of
view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject&quot;). As
when deciding whether a speech restriction is content-based or
content-neutral, &quot;[t]he government's purpose is the controlling
consideration.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,
791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); see also ibid.
(content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech restriction
is &quot;justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive noise ordinance
by pulling the plug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification
system is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because
the band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist views.
Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra. Nor does a municipality's
decision to prohibit political advertising on bus placards amount
to viewpoint discrimination when in the course of applying this
policy it denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor
of a particular political candidate. Accord, Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 2717-2718, 41 L.Ed.2d
770 (1974) (plurality opinion).
<P>
Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves
that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to
bar the government from skewing public debate. Other things being
equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows
one message while prohibiting the messages of *2549 those who
can reasonably be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-1421,
55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (&quot;Especially where ... the legislature's
suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of
a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views
to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended&quot;)
(footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176, 97 S.Ct. 421,
426, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976) (&quot;to permit one side of a debatable
public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views ...
is the antithesis of constitutional guarantees&quot;) (footnote
omitted); United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 736, 110 S.Ct.
3115, 3124, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (viewpoint discrimination involves
an &quot;inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another&quot;)
(plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate
that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most
pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if government
assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires
it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.
<P>
There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's application
of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under those Guidelines,
a &quot;religious activit[y],&quot; which is not eligible for
funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
It is clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions
was denied funding.
<P>
Letter from Student Council to Ronald W. Rosenberger. App. 54
(&quot;In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the
Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request
could not be funded as it is a religious activity&quot;). The
discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at 2534-2536, shows
beyond any question that it &quot;primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity ...,&quot; in the very
specific sense that its manifest function is to call students
to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular
moral action because of its Christian character. 
<P>
If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only
such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that
might compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.
But that is not what the regulation authorizes; it applies to
Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.
And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting
a particular belief not only &quot;in&quot; but &quot;about&quot;
a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists
as well as it does to deists and theists (as the University maintained
at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes,
see ante, at 2520). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide
Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not
its competitors. As understood by their application to Wide Awake,
they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests&quot; any view on the merits of religion;
they deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious apologetics.
<P>
The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while
I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the
important point is that even on the Court's own construction the
Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to
demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding restrictions
might have on learning in our nation's universities, the Court
describes the Guidelines as &quot;a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry,&quot; disentitling a vast array of
topics to funding. Ante, at 2520. As the Court reads the Guidelines
to exclude &quot;any writing that is explicable as resting upon
a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate
reality,&quot; as well as &quot;those student journalistic efforts
which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no
deity and no ultimate reality,&quot; the Court concludes that
the major works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred
from the funding forum. Ante, at 2520. The Court goes so far as
to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate
nothing much more *2550 than essays on &quot;making pasta or peanut
butter cookies....&quot; Ante, at 2520.
<P>
Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court
protests. The Court reads the word &quot;primarily&quot; (&quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality&quot;) right out of the Guidelines, whereas
it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve, or simply
descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a
given religion. But, as I said, that is not the important point.
Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restriction's
categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction would most
certainly not work any impermissible viewpoint discrimination
under any prior understanding of that species of content discrimination.
If a University wished to fund no speech beyond the subjects of
pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating
on the basis of someone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial
claim that pasta and cookies did not exist. The upshot would be
an instructional universe without higher education, but not a
universe where one viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.
<P>
The Guidelines are thus substantially different from the access
restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case upon which the
Court heavily relies in finding a viewpoint distinction here,
ante, at 2517-2518. Lamb's Chapel addressed a school board's regulation
prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises &quot;by any
group for religious purposes,&quot; even though the forum otherwise
was open for a variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes.
508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
<P>
&quot;Religious&quot; was understood to refer to the viewpoint
of a believer, and the regulation did not purport to deny access
to any speaker wishing to express a non-religious or expressly
antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid. (&quot;The
issue in this case is whether ... it violates the Free Speech
Clause of the First Amendment ... to deny a church access to school
premises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious
purposes, a film dealing with family and child-rearing issues&quot;);
id., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144, citing May v. Evansville-Vanderburgh
School Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1114 (CA7 1986). (FN13)
<P>
With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel
we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied
to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian
perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the
basis of viewpoint. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (considering as-applied challenge only).
Equally obvious is the distinction between that case and this
one, where the regulation is being applied, not to deny funding
for those who discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint,
but to those engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion
and religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint
discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between
viewpoint and content.
<P>
*2551. To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating
a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate
with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded
that primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together,
always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint
to any speech about any secular topic. Thus, the Court's reasoning
requires a university that funds private publications about any
primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily
espousing adherence to or rejection of religion. But a university's
decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fund publications
aimed at urging repentance before God does not skew the debate
either about racism or the desirability of religious conversion.
The Court's contrary holding amounts to a significant reformulation
of our viewpoint discrimination precedents and will significantly
expand access to limited-access forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424
U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976) (upholding regulation
prohibiting political speeches on military base); Cornelius, 473
U.S., at 812, 105 S.Ct., at 3454 (exclusion from fundraising drive
of political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint
neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health and welfare agencies);
Perry, 460 U.S., at 49-50, and n. 9, 103 S.Ct., at 957-958, and
n. 9 (ability of teachers' bargaining representative to use internal
school mail system does not require that access be provided to
&quot;any other citizen's group or community organization with
a message for school personnel&quot;); Lehman, 418 U.S., at 304,
94 S.Ct., at 2718 (exclusion of political messages from forum
permissible despite ability of nonpolitical speakers to use the
forum) (plurality opinion).

<P>
Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today's decision
portends much more than making a shambles out of student activity
fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehension is whetted by
Chief Justice Burger's warning in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 624, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2116, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971): &quot;in
constitutional adjudication some steps, which when taken were
thought to approach 'the verge,' have become the platform for
yet further steps. A certain momentum develops in constitutional
theory and it can be a 'downhill thrust' easily set in motion
but difficult to retard or stop.&quot;
<P>
I respectfully dissent. FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of
the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter
of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States
v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50
L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have
created a &quot;generally available subsidy program&quot; comparable
to respondent's Student Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 2536,
n. 1. The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is
squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide
&quot;for the support of Christian teachers.&quot;
<P>
Everson, 330 U.S., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539. Moreover, the section
of the bill cited by the dissent, see post, at 2536-2537, n. 1,
simply indicated that funds would be &quot;disposed of under the
direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries
of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,&quot;
Everson, supra, at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540. This provision disposing
of undesignated funds hardly transformed the &quot;Bill Establishing
a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; into
a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents
as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference
to religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the
bill would have been to promote &quot;the general diffusion of
Christian knowledge,&quot; id., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539; any possible
appropriation for &quot;seminaries of learning&quot; depended
entirely on future legislative action.
<P>
Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's
directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing
in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian
educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the
time of the founding were affiliated with some religious organization,
see C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was no system of
public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings of Public Education
in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917); see also A. Johnson, The
Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States
4 (1982) (&quot;In Virginia the parish institutions transported
from England were the earliest educational agencies. Although
much of the teaching took place in the home and with the aid of
tutors, every minister had a school, and it was the duty of the
vestry to see that all the poor children were taught to read and
write&quot;) (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious
tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation
of residual funds to sectarian &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot;
Finally, although modern historians have focused on the opt-out
provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed
the Virginia assessment as an evenhanded program; in fact, several
of the objections expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance
Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at
63, 67 S.Ct., at 534-535, focus clearly on the bill's violation
of the principle of &quot;equality,&quot; or evenhandedness. See
infra, at 2529-2530.
<P>
FN2. To the contrary, Madison's Remonstrance decried the fact
that the assessment bill would require civil society to take &quot;cognizance&quot;
of religion. Madison's Remonstrance p 1, reprinted in Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 64, 67 S.Ct. 504, 535, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Respondent's exclusion of religious activities
from SAF funding creates this very problem.
<P>
It requires University officials to classify publications as &quot;religious
activities,&quot; and to discriminate against the publications
that fall into that category. Such a policy also contravenes the
principles expressed in Madison'sRemonstrance by encouraging religious
adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus
&quot;degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose
opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.&quot;
Id. p 9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69, 67 S.Ct., at 537.
*2551_ 
<P>
FN3. A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount
to direct funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e.g.
Act of Feb. 20, 1833, ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the
State of Ohio to sell &quot;all or any part of the lands heretofore
reserved and appropriated by Congress for the support of religion
within the Ohio Company's ... purchases ... and to invest the
money arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund;
the proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied ... for
the support of religion within the several townships for which
said lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no
other use or purpose whatsoever&quot;); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch.
86, Secs. 1, 3, 6 Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College--a
Jesuit institution--&quot;lots in the city of Washington, to the
amount, in value, of twenty-five thousand dollars,&quot; and directing
the College to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter
using the dividends to establish and endow such professorships
as it saw fit); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 103,
105 S.Ct. 2479, 2514, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting)
(&quot;As the United States moved from the 18th into the 19th
century, Congress appropriated time and again public moneys in
support of sectarian Indian education carried on by religious
organizations&quot;).
<P>
FN4. The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment
Controversy
<P>
itself is inconsistent with the rigid &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
embraced by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the Virginia legislature
authorized tax exemptions for property belonging to the &quot;commonwealth,
or to any county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or
seminary of learning.&quot; Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, Sec.
1, 1800 Va.Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson, respondent's founder
and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the
use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology in
conjunction with other professional schools. See S. Padover, The
Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see also id., at 958 (noting that
Jefferson advocated giving &quot;to the sectarian schools of divinity
the full benefit [of] the public provisions made for instruction
in the other branches of science&quot;).
<P>
FN5. In the tax literature, this identity is called a &quot;tax
expenditure,&quot; a concept &quot;based upon recognition of the
fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person
or group by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or
exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms.
For example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to
add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax
rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government can
send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his
income, or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by
$23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct
payment were itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket,
the preacher would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction
as he would from the direct payment.&quot; Wolfman, Tax Expenditures:
From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985). In
fact, Congress has provided a similar &quot;tax expenditure&quot;
in Sec. 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a &quot;
'minister of the gospel' &quot; an unlimited exclusion for the
rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the
rental allowance paid to him. See id., at 492, n. 6.
<P>
Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the
tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 20,
n. 7, is misplaced in this context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue
Code, The Constitution, and the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure
Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 855,
862, n. 30 (1993):
<P>
&quot;Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on
the difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is
not a special provision. Professor Boris Bittker, for example,
argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any
tax could not be described as the equivalent of subsidies. Boris
I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis
was short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large
body of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept
that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The current
debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly identified
as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions are more
efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than direct
spending programs. See generally [numerous authorities].&quot;
*2551_ FN1. Justice THOMAS suggests that Madison would have approved
of the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle
of evenhandedness. Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison
advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial
support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy
program. Indeed, while Justice THOMAS claims that the &quot;funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects,&quot; ante, at 2529, it is clear that the bill
was more general in scope than this. While the bill, which is
reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74,
67 S.Ct. 504, 538-540, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided that each
taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted
his levy paid, id., at 73, 67 S.Ct., at 539, it would also have
allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any religious
society, in which case the legislature was to use these unappropriated
sums to fund &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot; Id., at 74, 67
S.Ct., at 540 (contrary to Justice THOMAS's unsupported assertion,
this portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other).
While some of these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious
in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally
understood at the time to be &quot;any school, academy, college
or university, in which young persons are instructed in the several
branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments.&quot;
N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st
ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary 956 (2d ed.1989).
Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally agreed that the
bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools. See,
e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 875,
897 (1986) (&quot;Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church,
with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools ...
The bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost
certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the
training of ministers&quot;); T. Buckley, Church and State in
Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) (&quot;The assessment
had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support
education rather than religion to do so&quot;); T. Curry, The
First Freedoms 141 (1986) (&quot;[T]hose taxes not designated
for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education&quot;).
It is beside the point that &quot;there was no system of public
education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed,&quot; ante, at 2529, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring);
because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have
made available for secular, public schools never materialized.
The fact that the bill, if passed, would have funded secular as
well as religious instruction did nothing to soften Madison's
opposition to it.
<P>
Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because
it treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 2529 (THOMAS,
J., concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison
did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions,
Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536, but to identify this
factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the bill is
unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed
against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the
Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one
point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of
those reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid
was being distributed equally among sects, and whether or not
the aid was going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded
government program. See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted
in Everson, 330 U.S., at 64, 67 S.Ct., at 535, p 1 (&quot;[I]n
matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution
of Civil Society, and ... Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance&quot;);
id., at 67, 67 S.Ct., at 536-537, p 6 (arguing that State support
of religion &quot;is a contradiction to the Christian Religion
itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers
of this world&quot;); ibid., p 7 (&quot;[E]xperience witnesseth
that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the
purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation&quot;).
Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous other petitions
in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that the
lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw. L. Levy, The
Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed.1994). For example, the petition
that received the largest number of signatories was motivated
by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily.
Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for
a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal
basis, and the outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of
the Virginia assessment was not such a bill; rather, it was the
Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed
in the text, proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes.
<P>
In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally
been targeted against &quot;governmental preferences for particular
religious faiths,&quot; ante, at 2530 (emphasis in original),
Justice THOMAS wishes to wage a battle that was lost long ago,
for &quot;this Court has rejected unequivocally the contention
that the Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference
of one religion over another,&quot; School Dist. of Abington v.
Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 216, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1568, 10 L.Ed.2d 844

----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (SOUTER, J., concurring).
<P>
*2551_ FN2. Justice THOMAS attempts to cast doubt on this accepted
version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical
facts that are largely inapposite. Ante, at 2530-2531, 2533 (concurring
opinion). As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress,
especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as
an authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses,
for &quot;like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses]
could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs
on them the next. [For example,] ... [t]en years after proposing
the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the
early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would
have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room
for political censorship.&quot; Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
626, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2676, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (concurring
opinion). The legislation cited by Justice THOMAS, including the
Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the Alien and
Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even less persuasive,
then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating from
the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument,
they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on
the Framers' intent.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's references to Madison's actions as a legislator
also provide little support for his cause. Justice THOMAS seeks
to draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking
to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison
did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities.
Ante, at 2530 (concurring opinion). That was not the task at hand,
however. Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating
the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made
no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that
came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years
later. That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than
necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal
was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone too far.
Ibid.
<P>
Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional
committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides
no support for more general principles that run counter to settled
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed
out, Madison, upon retirement, &quot;insisted that 'it was not
with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of
religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they
appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' &quot;
Lee, supra, at 625, n. 6, 112 S.Ct., at 2675, n. 6, quoting Letter
from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'
Constitution, at 105. And when we turned our attention to deciding
whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment
problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a
larger class of permissible government funding of religious activities.
Instead, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791, 103 S.Ct. 3330,
3335-3336, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular,
200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that &quot;[t]his
unique history&quot; justified carving out an exception for the
specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding
this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would
stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it
a broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.
<P>
FN3. In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following
facts: &quot;The University of Virginia has charged at all times
relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a
compulsory student activity fee of $14.00 per semester. There
is no procedural or other mechanism by which a student may decline
to pay the fee.&quot; App. 37; see also App. 9, 21.
<P>
FN4. To the extent the Court perceives some distinction between
the printing and dissemination of evangelism and proselytization,
and core religious activity &quot;in [its] usual sense,&quot;
ante, at 2524, this distinction goes entirely unexplained in the
Court's opinion.
<P>
FN5. In a narrow band of cases at the polar extreme from direct
funding cases, those involving essential public benefits commonly
associated with living in an organized society (like police and
fire protection, for example), evenhandedness may become important
to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.
<P>
*2551_ FN6. In Zobrest, a deaf student sought to have an interpreter,
provided under a state Act aiding individuals with disabilities,
accompany him to a Roman Catholic high school. In Witters, a blind
student sought to use aid, provided under a state program for
assistance to handicapped persons, to attend a private Christian
college. In Mueller, parents sought to take a tax deduction, available
for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren, for certain
expenses incurred in connection with providing education for their
children in private religious schools.
<P>
FN7. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct.
1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), is yet another example of a case
in which the Court treated the general availability of a government
benefit as a significant condition defining compliance with the
Establishment Clause, but did not deem that condition sufficient.
In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious
organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable
to &quot;a broad class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasipublic
corporations,&quot; id., at 673, 90 S.Ct., at 1413, but did not
rest on that factor alone. Critical to our decision was the central
principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited
under the Establishment Clause. &quot;It is sufficient to note
that for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment
the 'establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity.&quot; Id., at 668, 90 S.Ct., at 1411. We emphasized
that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government
funds in support of religious activities. &quot;The grant of a
tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not
transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from
demanding that the church support the state.&quot; Id., at 675,
90 S.Ct., at 1415. Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation
context, &quot;exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote
involvement between church and state and far less than taxation
of churches,&quot; and in operation &quot;ten[d] to complement
and reinforce the desired separation insulating&quot; church and
state, id., at 676, 90 S.Ct., at 1415; and that religious property
tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without disruption
to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 676-680, 90 S.Ct., at 1415-1417.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's assertion, that &quot;[a] tax exemption in many
cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from
a direct monetary subsidy,&quot; ante, at 2531 (concurring opinion)
(footnote omitted), assumes that the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;
tax base is so self-evident that any provision excusing a person
or institution from taxes to which others are subjected must be
a departure from the natural tax base rather than part of the
definition of the tax base itself. The equivalence (asserted by
Justice THOMAS, ante, at 2531) between a direct money subsidy
and the tax liability avoided by an institution (because it is
part of the class of institutions that defines the relevant tax
base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched long ago by Professor
Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). Justice THOMAS's suggestion that my &quot;reliance
on Bittker ... is misplaced in this context,&quot; ante, at 2532,
n. 5, is not on point. Even granting that Justice THOMAS's assertion
of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the
fact that the Court in Walz explicitly distinguished tax exemptions
from direct money subsidies, 397 U.S., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1414,
and rested its decision on that distinction. If Justice THOMAS's
assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court necessarily
was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding. Justice
THOMAS can hardly use Walz coherently for support after removing
the basis on which it relies.
<P>
FN8. Although the main opinion in Tilton was a plurality, the
entire Court was unanimous on this point. See, 403 U.S., at 682-684,
91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (plurality opinion); id., at 692, 91 S.Ct.,
at 2102 (Douglas, J., joined by Black and Marshall, JJ., concurring
in part and dissenting in part);

1, 91 S.Ct., at 2137, n. 1 (opinion of White, J.).
<P>
*2551_ FN9. Congress apparently also reads our cases as the University
did, for it routinely excludes religious activities from general
funding programs. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1062(b) (federal grant
program for institutions of higher education; &quot;[n]o grant
may be made under this chapter for any educational program, activity,
or service related to sectarian instruction or religious worship,
or provided by a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1069c (certain grants to higher education institutions &quot;may
not be used ... for a school or department of divinity or any
religious worship or sectarian activity ...&quot;); 20 U.S.C.
Sec. 1132c-3(c) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal assistance for renovation
of certain academic facilities; &quot;[n]o loan may be made under
this part for any educational program, activity or service related
to sectarian instruction or religious worship or provided by a
school or department of divinity or to an institution in which
a substantial portion of its functions is subsumed in a religious
mission&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1132i(c) (grant program for educational
facilities;
<P>
&quot;no project assisted with funds under this subchapter shall
ever be used for religious worship or a sectarian activity or
for a school or department of divinity&quot;); 20 U.S.C. Sec.
1213d (&quot;No grant may be made under this chapter for any educational
program, activity, or service related to sectarian instruction
or religious worship, or provided by a school or department of
divinity&quot;); 25 U.S.C. Sec. 3306(a) (1988 ed., Supp. V) (funding
for Indian higher education programs; &quot;[n]one of the funds
made available under this subchapter may be used for study at
any school or department of divinity or for any religious worship
or sectarian activity&quot;); 29 U.S.C. Sec. 776(g) (grants for
projects and activities for rehabilitation of handicapped persons;
&quot;[n]o funds provided under this subchapter may be used to
assist in the construction of any facility which is or will be
used for religious worship or any sectarian activity&quot;); 42
U.S.C. Sec. 3027(a)(14)(A)(iv) (requiring states seeking federal
aid for construction of centers for the elderly to submit plans
providing assurances that &quot;the facilit[ies] will not be used
and [are] not intended to be used for sectarian instruction or
as ... place[s] for religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5001(a)(2)
(1988 ed., Supp. V) (federal grants to support volunteer projects
for the elderly, but not including &quot;projects involving the
construction, operation, or maintenance of so much of any facility
used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for
religious worship&quot;); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9858k(a) (1988 ed., Supp.
V) (no child care and development block grants &quot;shall be
expended for any sectarian purpose or activity, including sectarian
worship or instruction&quot;).
<P>
FN10. The Court acknowledges that &quot;if the State pays a church's
bills it is subsidizing it,&quot; and concedes that &quot;we must
guard against this abuse.&quot; Ante, at 2524. These concerns
are not present here, the Court contends, because Wide Awake &quot;is
not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that
term as used in our case law.&quot; Ibid. The Court's concession
suggests that its distinction between paying a religious institution
and paying a religious institution's bills is not really significant.
But if the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake
as not a religious institution, &quot;at least in the usual sense,&quot;
the Court could presumably stop right there.
<P>
FN11. The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of public
funds to advance its own speech and the State's funding of private
speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related choices
is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the former.
Ante, at 2518-2519. I would not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-273, 108 S.Ct. 562,
569-571, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988), but I do suggest that this case
reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in drawing this
distinction. There is a communicative element inherent in the
very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,
15-19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-635, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam
), and although it is the student speakers who choose which particular
messages to advance in the forum created by the University, the
initial act of defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision
attributable to the University, not the students. In any event,
even assuming that private and state speech always may be separated
by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I
believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed
infra, this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination. *2551_
FN12. I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public
university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech
Clause. If, however, the determinations are made on the basis
of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint
distinction, there is no violation. In a limited-access forum,
a speech restriction must be &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum&quot; as well as viewpoint-neutral.
E.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147, quoting
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439. Because petitioners
have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable,
I express no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness
criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that
it applies in limited-access forum cases.
<P>
FN13. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 51, 121 L.Ed.2d
20, where counsel for the school district charged with enforcing
the restriction unequivocally admitted that anyone with an atheistic
or antireligious message would be permitted to use school property
under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The complete
exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as follows:
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address
the subject of family values and they thought there was a value
in not having children waste their time going to Sunday school
or church and therefore they had a point of view that was definitely
antireligious, they would be permitted, under your policy, to
discuss family values in that context?
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the
Court] you indicated that communists would be able to give their
perspective on family. I--I assume from that that atheists would
be able to give theirs under your rules.
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.&quot;

<P>
Before ERVIN, Chief Judge, WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, and SPROUSE,
Senior Circuit Judge.
<P>
OPINION
<P>
ERVIN, Chief Judge:
<P>
We must decide whether a state university's refusal to disburse
monies from its student activities fund for the benefit of a student-run
religious publication violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution. We hold that it does not.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
The University of Virginia collects a mandatory student activities
fee of fourteen dollars per semester, together with tuition payments,
from each of its full-time students. The proceeds of the collection
are deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (&quot;SAF&quot;),
which is used to support the wide variety of student organizations,
activities, and publications that function at the University.
<P>
To qualify for student-activity-fee funds, a student group first
must attain the status of a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot;
(&quot;CIO&quot;) at the University. CIO status is available to
any group that is composed in its majority of students, is managed
by officers who are full-time students, keeps an updated copy
of its constitution on file with the University, and signs an
anti-discrimination disclaimer. CIOs are given access to University
facilities, including meeting rooms and computer terminals, as
well as the right to apply for student-activity-fee funds. The
standard CIO agreement executed between qualified student groups
and the University states that benefits provided to the groups
by the University
<P>
should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations
are part of or controlled by the University, that the University
is responsible for the organizations' *271 contracts or other
acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations'
goals or activities.
<P>
As the corporate body responsible under state law for governing
the institution, (FN1) the Rector and Visitors of the University
of Virginia (&quot;Rector and Visitors&quot;) wield ultimate decisionmaking
power over the operation of the SAF. The Rector and Visitors have
delegated responsibility for allocating SAF monies to the University's
Student Council. A CIO seeking an SAF grant must submit a detailed
application for funding to the Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council, which approves or denies the request.
Appeal from a denial of funding by the Appropriations Committee
may be taken to the full Student Council. Upon the Council's affirmance
of the Appropriations Committee's decision, a second appeal may
be argued before the University's Student Activities Committee,
a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for
Student Affairs.
<P>
The decisions of each of these authorities with respect to awards
of SAF monies must be taken in compliance with certain guidelines
promulgated by the Rector and Visitors. These guidelines, adopted
in 1970, charge the Student Council with administering the SAF
&quot;in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the
University as well as with State and Federal law.&quot; The guidelines
prohibit several categories of student organizations from obtaining
SAF funds, according to the nature of the organization and the
purpose for which the funds would be used. Although they may attain
CIO status, fraternities and sororities, political and religious
organizations, and groups whose membership policies are exclusionary
in nature are ineligible for SAF funding. The following expenditures
and activities also are excluded by the guidelines: (1) honoraria
or similar fees; (2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment
and related expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities;
and (5) political activities. (FN2)
<P>
Once a student organization attains CIO status and becomes eligible
for funding, the guidelines prescribe the following criteria for
allocating SAF monies among CIOs: (1) the size of the group; (2)
the University-wide benefits conferred by the group's activities;
and (3) the group's financial self-sufficiency. After a student
organization is approved for funding, it submits expense vouchers
to the SAF, which are paid only upon a determination that a particular
expense is fundable under the guidelines. SAF monies are not paid
to the group, but are disbursed directly to the group's creditors
to discharge the fundable expense.
<P>
For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations qualified
as CIOs. Of these 343 groups, 135 applied for SAF funding, and
118 were awarded SAF monies. Numbered among the funded organizations
were fifteen student publications; (FN3) also included were the
Muslim Students Association, the Jewish Law Students Association,
and the C.S. Lewis Society.
<P>
B
<P>
In September 1990 Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate at the
University, joined with other University students to found Wide
Awake Productions. According to its constitution, Wide Awake Productions
is an unincorporated association with the stated purposes of (1)
&quot;publishing a magazine *272 of philosophical and religious
expression&quot;; (2) &quot;facilitating discussion which fosters
an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints&quot;;
and (3) &quot;providing a unifying focus for Christians of multicultural
backgrounds.&quot; Wide Awake Productions publishes Wide Awake:
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia (&quot;Wide
Awake &quot;), a nonprofit journal written and edited by the student
members of Wide Awake Productions. As stated by Rosenberger, who
serves as editor-in-chief of Wide Awake, the journal (FN4) was
launched when the members of Wide Awake Productions &quot;realized
that none of the fifteen student-run publications at the University
provided a forum for Christian expression,&quot; and decided to
fill this perceived void. See &quot;Letter from the Editor,&quot;
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia,
Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. Wide Awake and Wide Awake Productions are
not affiliated with any religious institution, and allow any University
student to join without regard to sex, race, religion, or color.
<P>
At the time notice of the instant appeal was filed, three issues
of Wide Awake had been published, with approximately 5,000 copies
of each issue being distributed free of charge to persons on the
University campus. According to editor Rosenberger's comments
in the first issue, Wide Awake 's mission is twofold: &quot;to
challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the
faith they proclaim[,] and to encourage students to consider what
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Id. In
furtherance of this mission, Wide Awake &quot;offers a Christian
perspective on both personal and community issues, especially
those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia.&quot;
Id.
<P>
The content of the three issues of Wide Awake published thus far
forms part of the record in this case. The first issue's cover
story, &quot;Eracing Mistakes,&quot; offered Christian solutions
for the enduring calamity of racism, see id. at 1, 12-14; other
articles treated such diverse issues as &quot;crisis pregnancy,&quot;
Oxford Christian apologeticist C.S. Lewis's ideas about evil and
free will, &quot;beating stress,&quot; and &quot;praying with
a thankful heart,&quot; all written from an avowedly Christian
stance. See id. at 4-5, 6-8, 15, 21. The featured contribution
in the second issue, &quot;Out of the Closet and Into the Light,&quot;
addressed the question &quot;How should the Church respond to
homosexuals ... and vice versa?&quot; See id., Mar./Apr.1991,
at 1, 14-17. The second issue also included an interview with
a Christian professor of mathematics at the University, an article
on Christian missionary work throughout the world, and two commentaries
offering spiritual guidance (titled respectively &quot;God's Word:
<P>
A Spiritual Advantage,&quot; and &quot;On Your Own: Hope and Spirit&quot;).
See id. at 5-7, 11-13, 20-21. The third issue contained articles
about a University graduate's experiences as a missionary in Moldavia,
eating disorders (titled &quot;From Calorie to Calvary&quot;),
and a Christian musician (&quot;Keith Green: Piano Man for Christ&quot;).
See id., Sept.-Oct. 1991, at 5-7, 12-14, 18-20. Columns in all
three issues reviewed newly released recordings of music of religious
disposition. (FN5) *273 The plaintiffs do not dispute that in
publishing Wide Awake they are engaged in a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot;
as the SAF guidelines define the phrase. (FN6) Indeed, after reading
its contents dispassionately, we are compelled to mark Wide Awake
's unflagging (FN7) invocation of religious, specifically Christian,
themes. The journal's pages are pervasively devoted to providing
a &quot;Christian perspective&quot; in printer's ink at the University
of Virginia. Wide Awake 's editorial stance extends to its advertising
sales: by the public release of the third issue represented in
the record (dated September/October 1991), roughly eighty percent
of the journal's five commercial and notice columns were given
over to Christian churches or to business entities purveying goods
and services of Christian bent. (FN8) Even Wide Awake 's physical
appearance draws attention to its religious posture:
<P>
the Christian symbol of the Cross, lying in a dark oval field,
is printed at the top of each page; another Cross marks the end
of each contribution.
<P>
Wide Awake Productions attained CIO status shortly after its founding.
Commensurate with this status, as the plaintiffs acknowledge,
the University openly accords Wide Awake Productions the same
access to University facilities as other CIOs. Such access includes
the use of University property for the group's meetings, functions,
and programs. CIO status affords the members of Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to University computer terminals, printers, and
other equipment employed in the preparation of manuscripts for
publication.
<P>
In January 1991, Ronald W. Rosenberger, on behalf of Wide Awake
Productions, submitted an application for SAF funding to the Appropriations
Committee of the Student Council in the amount of $5,862.00, to
cover publishing costs for Wide Awake. On February 26 of that
year the Appropriations Committee denied Rosenberger's application,
stating:
<P>
In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the ...
<P>
Committee determined your organization's request could not be
funded as it is a religious activity. This determination was made
after reviewing your first issue of Wide Awake. In particular,
the committee noted in your Editor's Letter that the publication
was &quot;a forum for Christian expression&quot; and a means &quot;to
challenge Christians (in how) to live&quot;....
<P>
Please be aware that this decision simply denies Student Activity
Fee funding for your publication. Wide Awake Productions may still
print and distribute issues on Grounds. (FN9)
<P>
The members of Wide Awake Productions promptly appealed the decision
to the full Student Council on March 3, 1991, contending that
their organization had satisfied all applicable SAF funding guidelines
and that the Appropriations Committee's denial of funding violated
the Constitution of the United States. The Student Council affirmed
the Appropriations Committee's decision without comment.
<P>
*274 Wide Awake Productions then appealed the Student Council's
ruling to the University's Student Activities Committee. On April
16, 1991, Associate Dean of Students Ronald J. Stump informed
Rosenberger of the Student Activities Committee's decision to
affirm the funding denial. Stump wrote:
<P>
After reviewing your organization's constitution, copies of the
magazine's first two editions, and the arguments presented at
last week's appeal by Wide Awake Productions and by [the] Student
Council, the Committee determined that the Wide Awake magazine
could not be funded as it is a religious activity. In effect,
the Student Activities Committee fully supports the decision and
reasoning provided to you in the February 26 letter from [the
Appropriations Committee]. As noted in [that] letter, Wide Awake
Productions may still print and distribute copies of the magazine
and as a CIO has full and equal access to other University facilities
and services.
<P>
The Student Activities Committee's repudiation exhausted all internal
avenues of appeal within the University for the institution's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
C
<P>
On July 11, 1991, the members of Wide Awake Productions brought
this action against the Rector and Visitors and Dean Stump pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
(FN10) The plaintiffs' complaint set forth three challenges to
the SAF guidelines' exclusion of &quot;religious activities,&quot;
including the publication of Wide Awake, from eligibility for
funding consideration, each predicated upon provisions of the
Constitution of the United States. To each of the plaintiffs'
federal constitutional claims were appended alternative and supplemental
claims seeking recovery under the provisions of Article I of the
Constitution of Virginia (FN11) and, in the case of Count Two,
under the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993). The plaintiffs did not
challenge directly the University's refusal to fund Wide Awake
Productions, except insofar as the adverse funding decisions flowed
directly from the requirements of the guidelines themselves.
<P>
(FN12)
<P>
Count One, the complaint's most comprehensive theory of recovery,
alleged that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for the
publication costs of Wide Awake violated the Free Speech and Press
Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
(FN13) and Article I, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution
(FN14) (1) by unlawfully depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions
of government benefits solely because of the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake; and (2) by illegally excluding
the members of Wide Awake Productions from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; created by the Rector and Visitors' establishment
of the SAF and promulgation of the funding guidelines. Count One
also contended that the guidelines' &quot;definitions for allocating
SAF funds to CIOs&quot; are unconstitutionally vague because persons
of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning, and unlawfully
*275 overbroad because they impinge constitutionally protected
activity.
<P>
Count Two of the complaint maintained that the guidelines' denial
of SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; violated the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
(FN15) Article I, Section 16 of the Virginia Constitution, (FN16)
and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993), (FN17) by discriminating
in the granting of a government benefit based upon (1) the religious
content of the expression in Wide Awake; and (2) the religious
beliefs, character, or affiliation of the members of Wide Awake
Productions. Count Two also imputed to the Rector and Visitors
&quot;conduct constitut[ing] a failure to give reasonable accommodation
to the plaintiffs' religious beliefs.&quot;
<P>
Count Three of the complaint alleged that the guidelines' prohibition
against subsidizing &quot;religious activit[ies],&quot; coupled
with the Rector and Visitors' denial of SAF funds to Wide Awake
Productions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution (FN18) and the Anti-Discrimination
Clause of Article I, Section 11 of the Virginia Constitution.
(FN19) Specifically, Count Three contended (1) that the guidelines
&quot;den[ied] plaintiffs the benefits to which other students
and CIOs are entitled&quot; by unconstitutionally discriminating
against Wide Awake Productions on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of its members' speech and association; and (2) that
the guidelines unconstitutionally discriminated against the plaintiffs'
religious speech &quot;by denying [them] the benefits that other
students and CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities receive
and have received....&quot; This viewpoint- and religious-based
discrimination, Count Three maintained, was not justified by a
compelling state interest, nor was it narrowly tailored to achieve
whatever minimal interest the Rector and Visitors may have in
refusing to fund student &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
The plaintiffs sought redress for their alleged injuries in the
form of (1) a declaratory judgment that the guidelines' prohibition
against the funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; violated
their rights under the United States Constitution, the Virginia
Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom; (2)
a permanent order enjoining the Rector and Visitors from promulgating
any proscription against the funding of Wide Awake Productions
on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its members' speech
in Wide Awake;
<P>
(3) compensatory damages of at least $5,862.00, the sum of SAF
funds unconstitutionally denied Wide Awake Productions; and (4)
an order awarding Wide Awake Productions reasonable costs and
attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988. (FN20)
<P>
*276 Agreeing that there were no material facts at issue, both
parties sought summary judgment as a matter of law. After hearing
oral argument on their opposing motions, the district court granted
summary judgment in favor of the Rector and Visitors on each count
of the plaintiffs' complaint, concluding (1) that the SAF was
not a &quot;limited public forum;&quot; (2) that application of
the funding guidelines did not result in viewpoint or content
discrimination against the speech of Wide Awake Productions; and
(3) that the denial of funding did not burden the plaintiffs'
free exercise of religion. See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 795 F.Supp. 175, 178-83 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.).
The court also held that the plaintiffs' equal
<P>
protection challenge to the guidelines failed because the members
of Wide Awake Productions had not adduced evidence of the Rector
and Visitors' discriminatory intent. Although the district court
did not scrutinize the complaint's allegations that the guidelines
violated the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, it held that the restrictions on funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; did not &quot;impose an impermissible burden
on the plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by ...
the State Constitution[ ], or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.&quot;
Id. at 17.
<P>
This appeal followed.
<P>
II
<P>
Before addressing the substance of the plaintiffs' assignments
of error, we wish to make clear what precisely is at issue in
this appeal. The complaint alleges that the Rector and Visitors
have violated rights guaranteed the plaintiffs by the Constitution
of the United States, the Constitution of Virginia, and the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom. Two of these sources derive from the
substantive law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such, they
comprise fonts of individual liberties independent of the Federal
Constitution, and are therefore susceptible of autonomous interpretation
by the courts of the Commonwealth. (FN21) Although the district
court embraced these pendent state-law claims in its favorable
grant of summary judgment to the Rector and Visitors, (FN22) they
were not controverted by the parties at the summary judgment hearing,
and were not subjected to independent scrutiny on their merits
below. We have no objective basis, therefore, upon which to assume
that any interpretation of the Virginia Constitution or the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom contributed separately to the judgment
from which this appeal was taken. The parties have not attempted
to resuscitate them in their briefs or at oral argument. To bring
grounds for relief to the attention of an appellate tribunal,
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure oblige the parties to
offer a written argument ... contain[ing] [their] contentions
... with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities ... and parts of the record
relied on.
<P>
Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5), (b). We observe that none of the briefs
filed by either party in this court contains &quot;contentions&quot;
about the application of the Virginia Constitution's Declaration
of Rights or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom to the instant
case, or &quot;citations to ... authorities&quot; that might illuminate
the special rights the state charter and religious-freedom statute
are said to guarantee. We therefore are compelled to conclude
that the parties have failed to appeal the district court's grant
of summary judgment with respect to these state-law theories of
recovery. Failure of this nature constitutes abandonment of the
claims, and precludes us from considering them further herein.
See Shopco Distrib. Co. v. Commanding Gen., 885 F.2d 167, 170
n. 3 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that failure to comply with terms
of former version of Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5) constitutes waiver
of asserted claims).
<P>
*277 Therefore, the scope of our inquiry is confined to such of
the plaintiffs' assignments of error as rest upon the Constitution
of the United States. These are two. (FN23) First, the plaintiffs
contend that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of
the First Amendment (1) by depriving them of government benefits
based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech in Wide
Awake, and (2) by excluding them from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; represented by the SAF. Second, the plaintiffs argue
that the guidelines' funding restrictions discriminate against
them in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment (1) by denying them benefits which other CIOs engaged
in religious speech and activities have received, and (2) because
the restrictions serve no compelling state interest, and are not
narrowly tailored to satisfy whatever minimal interest the Rector
and Visitors may have in denying funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
In the discussion that follows, we address these two claims in
turn, reviewing the legal conclusions on which the district court
granted summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., Brock v. Entre Computer
Ctrs., Inc., 933 F.2d 1253, 1259 (4th Cir.1991).
<P>
III
<P>
First, we examine the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
by depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions of government
benefits based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech
in Wide Awake.
<P>
A
<P>
Because our decision rests ultimately upon our understanding of
the language of the First Amendment, we here undertake cursory
review of certain principles of constitutional interpretation
that guide our deliberations.
<P>
Like their cultural and ideological ancestors the Magna Carta
(1215) and the English Bill of Rights (1688), the first ten amendments
to the Federal Constitution represent what Justice Story called
&quot;a solemn recognition of limitations upon the power of parliament;
that is, a declaration, that parliament ought not to abolish,
or restrict&quot; certain fundamental rights of the person. III
Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States
Sec. 980, at 695 (1833). Taken as a whole, the provisions of the
Bill of Rights form a stout bulwark against government encroachment
upon the fundamental liberties of every person within the jurisdiction
of the United States. The amendments weigh as a counterpoise to
the specifically enumerated powers granted by the people of the
several states to their national government in the first three
Articles of the Federal Constitution.
<P>
By its terms the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
reflects the limiting purpose of the Bill of Rights. The Clause
pronounces the federal legislature's impotence to curb any individual's
freedom to express verbally her views upon any subject; it states
that Congress shall &quot;make no law ... abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 3
(emphasis added). While the First Amendment thus represents a
guarantee that freedom will be preserved in the face of legislative
ambition, it goes no further. Although the Amendment preserves
inviolate the individual's right to speak, it sustains speech
itself only indirectly. The Speech and Press Clause cannot be
metamorphosed into a promise that the federal government will
purchase a bullhorn, paper, and ink for the convenience of every
garrulous member of the American populace. The Constitution does
not guarantee the American people the means of self-expression;
it simply pledges that Congress (and, through application of *278
the Fourteenth Amendment, the states (FN24)) will not enact laws
or regulations restraining at its inception a person's right freely
to speak her views and to disseminate them by every means at her
disposal. A century and six decades after the publication of his
commentaries on our national charter, Justice Story's expression
of this principle retains all its peerless power:
<P>
That this amendment was intended to secure to every citizen an
absolute right to speak, or write, or print, whatever he might
please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor,
is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man....
It is plain, then, that the language of the amendment imports
no more, than that every man shall have a right to speak, write,
and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without prior
restraint....
<P>
Story, supra, Sec. 993, at 703-04.
<P>
B
<P>
With these interpretative precepts firmly in hand, we turn to
the assignment of error lodged by the plaintiffs.
<P>
The plaintiffs do not suggest that the Rector and Visitors have
restrained them from speaking, writing, or printing commentary
upon religious themes, or indeed upon any other subject, on the
campus or within the purview of the University of Virginia. As
they freely admit, Wide Awake Productions is afforded the full
benefits of CIO status by the University. Its members are granted
the same access to meeting rooms on University grounds as other
CIOs, and are given generous run of University property for their
work and programs. The University affords Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to its computer terminals, printers, and other
equipment used to prepare manuscripts for publication. With the
University's full consent, the plaintiffs have thus far distributed
several thousand copies of Wide Awake on University grounds. The
plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot, suggest, therefore, that the
Rector and Visitors have placed a per se unconstitutional prior
restraint upon their freedom actually to speak or to publish their
views by denying them equal access to University facilities. Cf.
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278, 70 L.Ed.2d
440 (1981) (discussing erection of prior restraint against student
organization's use of state university property); Healy v. James,
408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2345, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972)
(same).
<P>
Nor is the plaintiffs' complaint simply that the Rector and Visitors
have refused to pay for the publication of their speech with treasure
from the University fisc. If such were the nature of this dispute,
we might leave the field of independent analysis fallow. For there
is no question that the Commonwealth of Virginia, like any private
owner of property, may preserve the land and chattels under its
control for the use to which they are dedicated, and decline to
lend them for other purposes. E.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;
Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3447-3448,
87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'
Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
As agents of the Commonwealth, the Rector and Visitors need not
subsidize extracurricular student activities in any form. Healy
v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 182 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346 n. 8, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). Having undertaken such subsidies, they need
not have promulgated criteria by which the Student Council could
differentiate between competing funding requests. Nor are the
Rector and Visitors under any affirmative obligation to ensure
that University students' expressive *279 activities are funded.
In language redolent of Justice Story's pointed commentary on
the Speech and Press Clause, the Supreme Court has rejected the
notion that the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the
press &quot;are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized
by the state.&quot; Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461
U.S. 540, 546, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2001, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983).
<P>
The Student Council's exercise of discretion in withholding SAF
monies from Wide Awake Productions is not, therefore, the basis
of the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs contend, instead,
that once the Rector and Visitors have chosen to promulgate guidelines
governing the allocation of funds that support student speech
among competing student interests, such guidelines cannot condition
funding awards on the content or viewpoint of a prospective recipient's
speech. The Rector and Visitors have violated the First Amendment,
the plaintiffs maintain, by denying them the benefit of a University-funded
SAF grant on grounds that their publication of Wide Awake constitutes
a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; (FN25) within the meaning of
the guidelines. Such discrimination contravenes the First Amendment,
they assert, because it implicitly condemns the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake. This content and viewpoint discrimination
imposes a prior restraint upon the ability of Wide Awake Productions
to enjoy government largesse, and, the plaintiffs contend, must
therefore be struck down.
<P>
C
<P>
Having identified the constitutional character of the plaintiffs'
first assignment of error, we proceed to seek its resolution.
<P>
The notion that, whenever a government benefit or privilege might
be withheld altogether, it may be withheld on whatever conditions
government chooses to impose, has been thoroughly repudiated by
the Supreme Court since the middle of this century. See, e.g.,
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 405, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-1795,
10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518,
526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958); see also
Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 11-5, at 781-84
(2d ed. 1988) (discussing &quot;elusive&quot; distinction between
withholding a government subsidy for and imposing a penalty upon
exercise of a constitutional right).
<P>
Unconstitutional conditions, which make enjoyment of a government
benefit contingent on sacrifice of an independent constitutional
right, are prima facie invalid. For if the government could deny
a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected
speech ..., his exercise of th[at] freedom[ ] would in effect
be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to
&quot;produce a result which [it] could not command directly.&quot;
Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.
<P>
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33
L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (quoting Speiser, 357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct.
at 1342). Whether a condition is unconstitutional depends on whether
the government may properly demand sacrifice of the particular
right asserted in the context of its exercise. FCC v. League of
Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 380, 395, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3117, 3125,
82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984).
<P>
We must decide whether the guidelines' prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; *280 imposes an unconstitutional
condition upon receipt of the government benefit inherent in an
award of SAF monies by infringing the plaintiffs' claimed First
Amendment right to indulge religious expression. This decision
harbors a two-part inquiry. First, we must determine whether the
publication of Wide Awake constitutes &quot;speech&quot; protected
by the Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment. If we so
decide, we then must ask whether the Rector and Visitors are imposing
an unconstitutional condition upon the exercise of the plaintiffs'
protected speech; that is, we must determine whether the Rector
and Visitors are demanding that the members of Wide Awake Productions
cease publishing religious speech in Wide Awake before they may
become eligible (FN26) for an award of SAF funds.
<P>
1.
<P>
With respect to the first part of this inquiry, we easily conclude
that the plaintiffs' publication of religious speech in Wide Awake
falls within the protective ambit of the Speech and Press Clause.
There is no question that discussions of religion are, as they
long have been, a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.
See, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563-2564, 69 L.Ed.2d
298 (1981); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 561-62, 68 S.Ct. 1148,
1150-51, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948). Although the Rector and Visitors'
prohibition of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
is not directed exclusively at religious speech, the phrase &quot;religious
activit[y]&quot; as defined in the guidelines necessarily encompasses
speech that &quot;primarily promotes or manifests a particular
belief[ ] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; The
word &quot;activity&quot; is defined as &quot;an occupation, pursuit,
or recreation in which a person is active,&quot; Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 22 (1976).
<P>
There can be no doubt that the publication of a journal of religious
expression is precisely such an occupation, pursuit, or recreation.
<P>
2.
<P>
Having answered the first prong of the inquiry affirmatively,
we address the second prong: Have the Rector and Visitors effectively
demanded that the members of Wide Awake Productions cease publishing
religious commentary in Wide Awake before they may become &quot;eligible&quot;
for an award of SAF funds? We conclude that they have.
<P>
The guidelines lay upon the Student Council an affirmative obligation
not to fund &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot; This obligation
means that religious expression, such as that in Wide Awake, is
never allowed to compete for funds with other forms of speech
that might be indulged by University students. Even if a student
organization achieves CIO status, to the extent that its pursuits
and functions consist of religious speech, the organization's
funding requests will be summarily rejected by the Student Council.
In effect, then, the Rector and Visitors' restriction has operated
to erect a prior restraint on University subsidization of all
forms of religious expression in which a CIO might engage. While
we acknowledge that a CIO has no right to funding by the Rector
and Visitors, see, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124
L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), when funds are made available to CIOs generally,
*281 they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
considerations of equal constitutional dignity. See Board of Educ.
v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2370-71, 110 L.Ed.2d
191 (1990) (plurality opinion); Grand Rapids Sch. Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 382, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3221-22, 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985);
<P>
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 746, 96 S.Ct. 2337,
2344-45, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976) (plurality opinion); Everson v.
Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 18, 67 S.Ct. 504, 513, 91 L.Ed. 711
(1947). Although government need not subsidize exercise of a constitutional
right, the lack of an affirmative duty of financial support does
not mean that government may, in general, penalize exercise of
constitutional rights by withholding from their possessors an
otherwise discretionary benefit.
<P>
We conclude that the Rector and Visitors' erection of a prior
restraint against University funding of such &quot;religious activities&quot;
as the publication of religious expression in Wide Awake constitutes
precisely such a penalty, because it restrains Wide Awake Productions
from gaining access altogether to a funding source generally available
to CIOs not engaged in religious expression. (FN27) This prior
restraint ultimately forces the members of Wide Awake Productions--unlike
their nonsectarian CIO colleagues--to seek financial sustenance
for their speech from coffers outside the University. The Rector
and Visitors' funding proscription thus creates an uneven playing
field on which the advantage is tilted towards CIOs engaged in
wholly secular modes of expression.
<P>
We hold, therefore, that the Rector and Visitors have conditioned
the plaintiffs' receipt of government benefits upon their foregoing
constitutionally protected religious expression.
<P>
D
<P>
In reaching and forbidding funding for speech that meets the definition
of &quot;religious activity,&quot; but not for speech of other
types, the SAF guidelines discriminate among speech on the basis
of its content. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 229-30, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-28, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
In order to justify differential treatment of funding eligibility
based on the content of the speech involved, &quot;the State must
show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.&quot; Id.
at 231, 107 S.Ct. at 1729; see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.
263, 270, 102 S.Ct. 269, 274, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461, 464-65, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 2292-93,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 184, 92 S.Ct.
2338, 2347-48, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). It is to this inquiry that
we now turn.
<P>
In defense of the guidelines' prohibition, the Rector and Visitors
claim a compelling interest in maintaining strict separation of
church and state. (FN28) They derive this interest *282 from the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which admonishes
Congress (and, through application of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the states (FN29)) to &quot;make no law respecting an establishment
of religion.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 1. The Rector and
Visitors argue that they cannot fund &quot;religious activities&quot;
without violating the Establishment Clause.
<P>
We agree with the Rector and Visitors that their interest as state
officials in complying with federal constitutional obligations,
including avoiding the creation of an &quot;establishment&quot;
of religion at the University of Virginia, may be characterized
as compelling. See Widmar, 454 U.S. at 271, 102 S.Ct. at 275.
It does not follow, however, that offering Wide Awake Productions
an equal opportunity to compete for SAF funds necessarily would
be incompatible with the Establishment Clause. Id.
<P>
That government largesse ultimately should redound to the benefit
of persons engaged in promoting religion does not necessarily
entail violation of the Establishment Clause. If such were the
case, &quot;a church could not be protected by the police and
fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair.&quot;
Id. at 274-75, 102 S.Ct. at 277. Moreover, such an extreme position
is plainly contrary to many of the Supreme Court's decisions upholding
government aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools.
See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S.
----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-67, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(summarizing the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence with
respect to government aid to parochial schools).
<P>
To test the Rector and Visitors' Establishment Clause justification
for the guidelines' funding policy, then, we must consider whether
awarding SAF monies to the members of Wide Awake Productions to
defray the publication costs of Wide Awake would constitute an
&quot;establishment of religion&quot; at the University of Virginia.
In making this determination, we seek enlightenment in the Supreme
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. That jurisprudence
holds that a governmental policy will not offend the Establishment
Clause if it can pass constitutional muster under the three-pronged
test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d
745 (1971), which guides &quot;[t]he general nature of our inquiry
in this area,&quot; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394, 103 S.Ct.
3062, 3066, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983):
<P>
First, the [governmental policy] must have a secular legislative
purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion ...; finally, the [policy]
must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.
<P>
Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. (FN30) *283 In
the paragraphs that follow, we consider the Rector and Visitors'
Establishment Clause justification for prohibiting SAF funding
of &quot;religious activities&quot; in light of Lemon. (FN31)
<P>
1.
<P>
Lemon 's first prong focuses on the &quot;purpose that animated&quot;
the Rector and Visitors' adoption of the SAF funding guidelines,
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 585, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2578,
96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), and asks whether that purpose was secular.
<P>
The obvious point of departure for analyzing the purpose of the
guidelines is the Rector and Visitors' comments at the time of
their adoption. Although the guidelines are the result of largely
undocumented deliberations by the Rector and Visitors, and thus
cannot be said to possess a &quot;legislative history&quot; as
that term usually is understood, they do contain a &quot;Student
Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; relevant to our deliberations.
This statement reads:
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
The funding guidelines themselves, which immediately follow the
&quot;Student Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; and are
part of the *284 same document, were adopted by the Rector and
Visitors in an attempt to give practical effect to the SAF's goal
of providing financial support for student organizations related
to the University's educational purpose. In the third section
of the guidelines, titled &quot;Student Expenditures and Activities
Not Eligible for Funding,&quot; the Rector and Visitors proscribed
funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; on the ground that
such activities &quot;do not relate to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot;
<P>
These statements make clear that the Rector and Visitors' aim
in denying SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; was
to comply with the University of Virginia's educational function--a
facially secular legislative purpose. (FN32) Because religion
is taught and studied as a subject of formal academic inquiry
at the University, however, the plaintiffs contend that religious
expression forms part of the institution's educational &quot;purpose.&quot;
They argue, therefore, that the University, already having admitted
religious discussion formally into the academic curriculum, can
have no stake in depriving such discussion of access to its coffers,
even if the source of the discussion is a student organization.
<P>
We disagree. That religion is studied at the University does not
mean that offering SAF funding to Wide Awake would promote the
essentially secular &quot;educational purpose&quot; of the institution,
or that such funding necessarily would not threaten the Establishment
Clause. Since its founding by Thomas Jefferson in the second decade
of the nineteenth century, the University's educational purpose
has included teaching and scholarship on a wide array of subjects,
(FN33) including the organized study of religious systems. As
the plaintiffs note, while serving as Rector of the University
Jefferson explained that no professorship of divinity had been
established &quot;in conformity with the principles of [the] constitution,
which place all sects of religion on an equal footing,&quot; but
that arrangements would be made to allow various denominations
to establish schools &quot;on the confines of the University&quot;
and to allow them access to University facilities. 19 The Writings
of Thomas Jefferson 408 (A. Bergh ed., 1905) (report to University
Visitors dated Oct. 7, 1822). That such &quot;schools&quot; were
incorporated into the University's intellectual and academic life
does not prevent the Rector and Visitors from employing funding
restrictions to advance the &quot;secular purpose&quot; of avoiding
an establishment of religion at the institution.
<P>
As we see it, it is clear from the SAF's statement of purpose
that the funding guidelines were motivated primarily, if not entirely,
by a legitimate secular purpose--the advancement of the University
of Virginia's educational mission. We do not question the propriety
of, nor the secular motivation for, the Rector and Visitors' interest
in preserving University funds for the institution's educational
mission. The Rector and Visitors do not dispute that, on the whole,
religious concerns were not the sole motivation behind the guidelines.
See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1362,
79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). The record gives us no reason to doubt
that the Rector and Visitors' expressed purposes are &quot;sincere
and not a sham.&quot; Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 1366. Therefore,
we hold that the guidelines' proscription against funding of &quot;religious
activit[ies]&quot; is not motivated wholly by an impermissible
purpose, and does not offend the Establishment Clause.
<P>
2.
<P>
As is usual in Establishment Clause cases, see, e.g., Grand Rapids
School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 383-98, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3222-30,
*285 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), the more subtle question is whether
the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions is to inhibit
or advance religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111.
<P>
Although we concluded above that the prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; denies religious speech the same
access to the SAF accorded secular speech, and thus violates the
Speech and Press Clause, whether &quot;religion&quot; is thereby
inhibited or advanced is a different matter. The Rector and Visitors
have not attempted to ban the publication of Wide Awake; indeed,
they have supported its religious mission by allowing the members
of Wide Awake Productions access to University meeting and printing
facilities equal to that afforded all other CIOs. The University
permits the plaintiffs to distribute Wide Awake on its grounds
without limitation.
<P>
Notwithstanding its refusal to subsidize the journal directly,
the University's sustenance of religion in these incidental respects
does not, in our view, inhibit religion. The University's policy
of allowing the members of Wide Awake Productions open access
to campus facilities accords the plaintiffs ample opportunity
to express their religious views, and leaves the University community
as a whole free to read and consider them. The Rector and Visitors'
funding policy simply declines to take the additional step of
actively subscribing University funds to Wide Awake 's particular
religious perspective. Under such circumstances as these, we are
unpersuaded that the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions,
involving as they do only the direct allocation of public monies,
would be to inhibit religion.
<P>
On the other hand, it would be difficult to view awarding SAF
monies to Wide Awake as anything but state sponsorship--and therefore
advancement--of religious belief. As the Constitution of Wide
Awake Productions attests, Wide Awake strives to challenge Christians
to live according to the faith they espouse, and to encourage
students at the University to consider &quot;what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2. The journal's contents--some of which are aimed at proselytizing
non-Christians--have pursued these goals indefatigably throughout
the three issues of Wide Awake represented in the record. Using
public funds to support a publication so clearly engaged in the
propagation of particular religious doctrines would constitute
a patent Establishment Clause violation. In the words of Justice
Powell:
<P>
Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing
religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is
so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed
in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious
activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.
<P>
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d
923 (1973) (emphasis added). Here, then, we hold that the primary
effect of an SAF subsidy of Wide Awake 's publication costs would
be to advance religion.
<P>
3.
<P>
It is the third of the three Lemon criteria--whether the guidelines'
prohibition of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot; fosters
an excessive government entanglement with religion--that is most
plainly implicated by this case. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct.
at 2111. The constitutional prohibition against excessive church-state
entanglement reflects James Madison's concern that secular and
religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respective
spheres of choice and influence. See III Jonathan Elliott, Debates
on the Federal Constitution 431-32, 729-31 (1891) (remarks of
James Madison); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333
U.S. 203, 212, 68 S.Ct. 461, 465-66, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948). (FN34)
The entanglement principle thus stems ultimately from fears, originally
propounded by the First Amendment's principal framer, that church-state
entanglement might strain the political system, compromise *286
liberty of conscience, and, ultimately, &quot;destroy government
and downgrade religion.&quot; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431,
82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1961); Laurence H. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law Sec. 14-11, at 1226 (2d ed. 1988)
(summarizing the import of church-state entanglement).
<P>
The indirect and incidental conferral of a government benefit
to religious institutions has never been thought a sufficient
defect to warrant the invalidation of a state policy. Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-69, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276-77, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981);
<P>
Committee for Public Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,
413 U.S. 756, 775, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2966, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973).
Indeed, the Supreme Court has sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary
benefits to religious groups where government has created open
fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited.
In Widmar, for example, the Court held that a state university
which makes its facilities available to registered student groups
may not deny equal access to a registered student group desiring
to use those facilities for religious worship or discussion. 454
U.S. at 277, 102 S.Ct. at 278. Thus, although religious groups
may directly benefit from access to university facilities, a state
university may not discriminate against them based on the content
of their speech.
<P>
Direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects,
however, is a beast of an entirely different color. A proper respect
for the Establishment Clause compels the Rector and Visitors to
pursue a course of &quot;neutrality&quot; toward religion. Yet
providing SAF monies to defray the publication costs of Wide Awake
inevitably would advance Wide Awake 's Christian mission: &quot;to
encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. The
potentially divisive political effect of such funding is a factor
of recurring significance in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence
surrounding Lemon 's &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; prong.
As Justice Black emphasized in Everson v. Board of Education,
330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), competition among
religious sects for political and religious supremacy has occasioned
considerable civil strife throughout history, &quot;generated
in large part&quot; by competing efforts to gain or maintain the
support of government. Id. at 8-9, 67 S.Ct. at 507-509. As we
see it, the &quot;potential for political divisiveness related
to religious belief and practice&quot; would be aggravated if
the University were to fund the publication of Wide Awake. The
possibility of a continuing annual appropriation for the benefit
of a single religion carries the potential for seriously divisive
political consequences at the University of Virginia. The prospect
of such divisiveness, as Justice Powell has admonished, is a &quot;warning
signal&quot; the Rector and Visitors would ignore at their, and
the University's, peril. Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 798, 93 S.Ct. at
2978.
<P>
Because Wide Awake is a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion
and advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal
philosophy, for the University to subsidize its publication would,
we believe, send an unmistakably clear signal that the University
of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote the
wide promulgation of such values. Since offering SAF funds to
the members of Wide Awake Productions would excessively entangle
the University of Virginia with the propagation of the Christian
religion, we hold that the Rector and Visitors have proved the
existence of a compelling state interest in complying with the
Establishment Clause. This compelling interest justifies the Rector
and Visitors' decision to promulgate guidelines excluding the
membership of Wide Awake Productions from access to SAF monies.
<P>
E
<P>
It remains for us to consider whether the funding guidelines'
proscription against &quot;religious activities&quot; is sufficiently
circumscribed to survive the strictest judicial scrutiny.
<P>
The Supreme Court has held that a government policy is &quot;narrowly
tailored&quot; if it &quot;targets and eliminates no more than
the exact source of the 'evil' it seeks to remedy.&quot; Frisby
v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2503, 101 L.Ed.2d
420 (1988). If *287 the guidelines' &quot;religious activities&quot;
proscription had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability
of student organizations to engage in meaningful religious expression,
the plaintiffs' contention that the proscription is not narrowly
tailored might carry considerable force. Yet it is difficult for
us to conceive how the Rector and Visitors may avoid offending
the Establishment Clause without extending the prohibition on
SAF funding to all &quot;religious activities.&quot; Because the
First Amendment forbids government to promulgate policies &quot;respecting
an establishment of religion,&quot; government is left no choice
but to foreswear financial support of the myriad forms of religious
endeavor in which a student organization might engage. Hence,
we believe that the guidelines' declaration that student organizations
involved in &quot;religious activities&quot; as that phrase is
defined (FN35) is not &quot;substantially broader than necessary&quot;
to achieve the Rector and Visitors' legitimate constitutional
ends, City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808,
104 S.Ct. 2118, 2130, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), and thus satisfies
the requirement of narrow tailoring.
<P>
F
<P>
In summary, we conclude that the Rector and Visitors' refusal
to permit funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; places a
presumptively unconstitutional condition upon access to government
benefits in violation of the Free Speech and Press Clause of the
First Amendment. We further conclude, however, that the Rector
and Visitors have shown the existence of a compelling state interest
in (1) foregoing funding awards that would have the primary effect
of advancing religion at the University of Virginia, and (2) preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion. Finally, the Rector and Visitors' restriction against
funding &quot;religious activities&quot; is narrowly tailored
to achieve this compelling state interest. Having survived the
strictest judicial scrutiny, the funding restriction cannot be
labelled constitutionally invalid under the Speech and Press Clause.
<P>
IV
<P>
The district court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the
guidelines' proscription of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause by excluding them from
the &quot;limited public forum&quot; represented by the SAF. After
careful and reasoned consideration of the governing precedents,
see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry
Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), the court concluded
that the Rector and Visitors' systematic, purposeful exclusion
of certain student groups from access to SAF funds indicated that
the Rector and Visitors intended the SAF to be a nonpublic forum.
See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 795
F.Supp. 175, 178-81 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.)
<P>
We agree that the Rector and Visitors have not created a limited
public forum by awarding SAF funds only to those student organizations
which, in the view of University authorities, advance the institution's
essentially secular educational mission although we do so for
a different reason. As laid out in part III, supra, we believe
that the proper analysis of this case lies under the line of authority
dealing with content-based discrimination relating to government-generated
benefits or burdens. The long line of public forum cases have
taken &quot;forum&quot; in a fairly literalistic way involving
physical space, and we do not see how it advances the jurisprudence
to wrench that word out of its accepted form to encompass this
type of case already subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
<P>
V
<P>
We finally turn to the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
prohibition against funding of &quot;religious activities&quot;
discriminates against them in contravention of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (1) by denying them benefits
which other CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities have
received, and (2) because the restrictions serve no compelling
state interest, *288. and are not narrowly tailored to satisfy
whatever interest the Rector and Visitors may have in denying
funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
A
<P>
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides
that no state shall &quot;deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. XIV,
Sec. 1, cl. 4. The plaintiffs contend that the Rector and Visitors
have infringed their rights under the Equal Protection Clause
by awarding SAF monies to the Muslim Students Association, the
Jewish Law Students Association, and the C.S. Lewis Society while
denying funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
To establish an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must show
discriminatory intent as well as disparate effect. See Crawford
v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3221, 73
L.Ed.2d 948 (1982);
<P>
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,
265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Washington v. Davis,
426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976);
Irby v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352, 1355 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Upon careful review of the summary judgment record,
the district court found no evidence to indicate that the University's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions was the product
of discriminatory intent. Because this finding is not contested
by the plaintiffs on appeal, we are constrained to hold that the
district court's factual findings on the point are not tainted
with clear error. Moreover, the plaintiffs' failure to argue the
existence of discriminatory intent as a matter of law on appeal
deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the merits of their equal
protection claim, and compels us to affirm the district court's
decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Rector and
Visitors.
<P>
B
<P>
For the reasons stated in part III, supra, we already have held
that the Rector and Visitors' refusal to fund &quot;religious
activities&quot; serves the compelling state interest of preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion, and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. We
therefore need not consider this question again for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Rector and Visitors' stake in avoiding
an excessive entanglement with religion is equally strong in all
constitutional contexts, including that of the Equal Protection
Clause, if, as we hold, no prima facie violation of the plaintiffs'
equal protection rights exists. This assignment of error therefore
warrants no further discussion.
<P>

<P>
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court
is hereby AFFIRMED.

FN1. See Va.Code Ann. Secs. 23-69 to -85 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993)
(delegating to the Rector and Visitors responsibility for governing

policies for the execution of this duty).
<P>
FN2. This case involves a challenge to the University's refusal
to fund a student organization engaged in religious expression.
Accordingly, we note that the guidelines offer definitions of
the phrases &quot;religious organization&quot; and &quot;religious
activity.&quot; A &quot;religious organization&quot; is defined
as &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; The guidelines
define a &quot;religious activity&quot; as &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;

<P>
FN4. We note that the editors of Wide Awake would reject our use
of the noun &quot;journal&quot; to describe their publication:
<P>
We ... chose to call our magazine a perspective instead of a journal
or viewpoint. The word perspective embraces the idea of viewing
a situation from a particular angle (in this case a Christian
angle), rather than viewing a situation with a particular conclusion
in mind (as a politically partisan magazine would do). Our perspective
is a starting point, not a finish line.

[hereinafter Wide Awake ], Mar.-Apr. 1991, at 4. We employ the
<P>
nomenclature &quot;journal&quot; herein not to cast doubt upon
the editors' preference, but purely as a generic appellation;
thus, for our purposes a &quot;journal&quot; is simply &quot;[a]
periodical containing articles of interest to a particular group....,&quot;
Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 656 (1988); &quot;a
periodical publication dealing with matters of current interest....,&quot;
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1221 (1976). This
usage comports with the editors' own description of Wide Awake
as &quot;a collection of articles exploring from within a Christian
framework various issues, both of widespread general interest
and of particular interest to Christians.&quot; Wide Awake, Mar./Apr.

<P>
FN25. The guidelines draw a distinction between &quot;religious
organizations&quot; and &quot;religious activities.&quot; &quot;Religious
organizations&quot; are student groups whose whole or primary
purpose is to practice devotion to an ultimate reality or deity;
such groups are wholly barred from receiving SAF funds. &quot;Religious
activities,&quot; on the other hand, are forms of conduct or behavior
that cannot, commensurate with the guidelines, be subsidized with
SAF monies. The result of the guidelines' identification of these
two categories, however, is the total proscription of SAF funding
for all forms of religious endeavor by CIOs at the University.
<P>
When the Student Council's Appropriations Committee, and later
the Student Activities Committee, informed Ronald W. Rosenberger
that Wide Awake Productions would not be the recipient of SAF
funds, they referred to the publication of Wide Awake as a &quot;religious
activity.&quot; It has not been suggested that the defendants
rejected the funding request because Wide Awake Productions constitutes
a &quot;religious organization.&quot; Hence we assume with the
parties that the denial of funding rested on a determination that
Wide Awake was &quot;an activity ... primarily promot[ing] or
manifest[ing] a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an
ultimate reality.&quot;
<P>
FN26. The parties wrangle at considerable length over the question
whether Wide Awake Productions ever was &quot;eligible&quot; for
SAF funding at all. The plaintiffs contend that attainment of
CIO status by Wide Awake Productions made the organization &quot;eligible&quot;
to receive SAF monies. The Rector and Visitors argue that Wide
Awake Productions never was &quot;eligible&quot; for funding because
its central purpose--publication of Wide Awake--constituted a
&quot;religious activity.&quot; We need not address the merits
of these opposing positions, because we reject forthwith the Rector
and Visitors' suggestion that they be given unlimited discretion
to determine the &quot;eligibility&quot; of student groups for
SAF funding to the extent such discretion derogates the provisions
of the Bill of Rights. The duty of upholding (and therefore of
not wounding indirectly) the Federal Constitution devolves upon
the Rector and Visitors as a matter of law; as agents of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, the Rector and Visitors are bound to observe the
strictures of the First Amendment, and may not issue regulations
transgressing its bounds. As we note elsewhere herein, once SAF
funds are made available to student groups at the University,
they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
the showing of a compelling state interest.
<P>
*288_ FN27. We do not address the guidelines' prohibition of SAF
funding for such organizations as fraternities and sororities
or for such activities as social entertainment or philanthropic
contributions. Those excluded categories are not at issue in the
instant case. See supra note 2 and accompanying text.
<P>
FN28. In defense of their position, the Rector and Visitors cite
a number of recent decisions by the Supreme Court; without exception,
none of these cases are relevant to the question before us, and
we find it unnecessary to discuss them at length. For thoroughness'
sake, however, we observe that Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), on which the Rector and
Visitors lay great emphasis, did not involve the erection of a
prior restraint on abortion counseling by recipients of family
planning funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act,
42 U.S.C. Secs. 300 to 330a-6a. In Rust, regulations issued by
the Secretary of Health and Human Services simply limited the
ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related
expressive activities. Id. at 176-77, 111 S.Ct. at 1764. Although,
like the SAF funding restrictions at issue here, the regulations
broadly prohibited Title X projects from engaging in activities
that &quot;encourage[d], promote[d] or advocate[d] abortion as
a method of family planning,&quot; id. at 180, 111 S.Ct. at 1765,
there was no question that the recipients were recipients--that
is, that they already had received Title X funding. In his opinion
for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized this distinction:
<P>
Petitioners' reliance on [the Court's &quot;unconstitutional conditions&quot;
cases] is unavailing ... because here the government is not denying
a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public
funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.
<P>
Id. at 196, 111 S.Ct. at 1774. Thus, the issue in Rust was not--as
here--whether the recipients could obtain access to government
benefits. It was, instead, whether the government could be allowed
to dictate the use to which already-allocated funds could be dedicated.
<P>

504, 511-512, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947).
<P>
FN30. As we are well-aware, the Supreme Court's applications of
Lemon have been characterized by fine distinctions, and have aroused
considerable controversy among the Justices themselves, even to
the point of frequent suggestion in nonmajority opinions that
Lemon be abandoned. We note, for example, Justice Scalia's recent
denunciation of Lemon:
<P>
Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits
up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed
and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence
once again, frightening the little children....

adequate standards for deciding Establishment Clause cases&quot;).

Nevertheless, &quot;Lemon, however frightening it might be to
some, has not been overruled.&quot; Lamb's Chapel, --- U.S. at

decisions of the Supreme Court, not the pronouncements of a single
Justice or even of a pair of Justices in dissent.
<P>
As Justice Powell has stated, the three-pronged Lemon test ...
is the only coherent [Establishment Clause] test a majority of
the Court has ever adopted.... Lemon has never been overruled
or its test modified.
<P>
Jaffree, 472 U.S. at 64, 105 S.Ct. at 2494 (Powell, J., concurring)
(footnote and citations omitted). For purposes of the Establishment
Clause question presented here, therefore, we are bound to consider
Lemon governing precedent.
<P>
*288_ FN31. We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme
Court's decision in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1,
109 S.Ct. 890, 103 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (plurality opinion), controls
our analysis of the Establishment Clause issue presented by this
case, and obviates the need to examine the guidelines' restrictions
in light of Lemon v. Kurtzman. Texas Monthly involved a state
sales tax exemption for &quot;[p]eriodicals that are published
or distributed by a religious faith and that consist wholly of
writings sacred to a religious faith.&quot; Texas Monthly, 489
U.S. at 5, 109 S.Ct. at 894. The Court held that the exemption
was insufficiently broad--that is, that it did not reach an adequately
wide class of publications--to pass Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
If Texas Monthly has application in the instant case, it is only
as an extra pillar for our initial, but not dispositive, holding
that the SAF guidelines' &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; prohibition
has erected a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on
the receipt of a government benefit. In his opinion for a three-Justice
plurality, Justice Brennan stated:
<P>
[W]hen government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations
that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause and that either
burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen
as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to free exercise
of religion ..., it &quot;provide[s] unjustifiable awards of assistance
to religious organizations&quot; and cannot but &quot;conve[y]
a message of endorsement&quot; to slighted members of the community.
This is particularly clear where, as here, the subsidy is targeted
at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.
<P>
Id. at 15, 109 S.Ct. at 899 (quoting Corporation of Presiding
Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2874-75, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). As we explain below,
an award of SAF funds to defray publication costs of Wide Awake
would &quot;convey a message of endorsement&quot; of Christianity
to non-Christian members of the University of Virginia community.
&quot;This is particularly clear,&quot; id., because, as we observe,
such a subsidy would be targeted at a publication whose purpose
is &quot;to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means,&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2--a goal plainly contemplating the &quot;promulgat[ion]&quot;
of Christian teachings.
<P>
That Texas Monthly supports one wing of our analysis does not,
however, release us from the obligation of testing the Rector
and Visitors' asserted state interest in complying with the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, Justice Brennan's opinion addressed Texas's Establishment
Clause defense of its sales tax exemption by holding that the
exemption lacked sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under Lemon.
See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 8-17, 109 S.Ct. at 895-901. Because
this case involves a direct governmental subsidy of religious
expression rather than a mere exemption from the payment of duties,
it is not directly on point with Texas Monthly.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
MICHAEL, District Judge.
<P>
In this case, the court is asked to resolve the difficult question
of whether a &quot;student activities fund,&quot; comprised of
mandatory student fees, constitutes a limited public forum. For
the reasons set forth below, *177 the court concludes that the
answer to this riddle is &quot;no.&quot;
<P>
I.
<P>
In September of 1990, plaintiff Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate
student at the University of Virginia (the University), joined
with other University students to form Wide Awake Productions
(WAP). WAP is an unincorporated association officially recognized
by the University as a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO).
This recognition is given to all student organizations which execute
an annual agreement with the University and meet certain minimal
requirements. (FN1) The benefit of becoming a CIO is that such
organizations are given access to University facilities; i.e.
meeting rooms, computer terminals, etc.
<P>
WAP publishes Wide Awake Magazine (Wide Awake), a non-profit journal
written, edited and published by the student members of WAP. Mr.
Rosenberger serves as the magazine's publisher, while other named
plaintiffs include members of the management and editorial staff.
To date, three issues of Wide Awake have been published, with
approximately 5,000 copies of each issue distributed free of charge
to students on the University campus.
<P>
In January of 1991, WAP submitted an application for funding from
the University in the amount of $5,862.00 to offset the cost of
publishing its magazine. Specifically, WAP sought funding from
monies deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (SAF).
The SAF is funded by a mandatory student activities fee collected
from every full-time student at the University. The activity fee
is designed to provide financial support for student organizations
related to the educational purposes of the University.
<P>
The defendants in this action, the Rector and Board of Visitors
of the University (the Board) (FN2) have ultimate responsibility
for the operation of the SAF. The Board has delegated the responsibility
of allocating SAF funds to the University's Student Council. The
Student Council disburses SAF funds to those CIOs deemed eligible
for funding as determined by Guidelines issued by the Board. These
Guidelines prohibit several categories of student organizations
from obtaining SAF funds. Ineligible groups include fraternities
and sororities, political and religious organizations, and those
groups whose membership is exclusionary in nature. Further, the
following expenditures and activities are also excluded by the
Guidelines: (1) honoraria or similar fees;
<P>
(2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment or related
expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities; and
(5) political activities.
<P>
A CIO seeking SAF monies must first submit a request for funding
to the Student Council Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council. As noted earlier, WAP made its first
and only request for funding in January of 1991. The Chairman
of the Student Council denied the funding request because the
Appropriations Committee determined that publication of Wide Awake
constituted a &quot;religious activity.&quot; (FN3) WAP appealed
this decision to the full Student Council, which affirmed the
appropriation Committee's denial of funding. WAP pursued all internal
means of appeal before filing suit in this court on July 11, 1991.
The plaintiffs allege that the denial of SAF benefits violates
*178 their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom
of association, free exercise of religion, and equal protection
of the laws in violation of the United States Constitution, the
Virginia Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.
Plaintiffs have also set forth a cause of action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983.
<P>
On November 12, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
judgment, asking this court for a declaratory judgment that the
defendants had indeed violated the plaintiff's constitutional
rights. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment
and both sides appeared before this court for oral argument on
these motions. Both sides agree, with minor exceptions addressed
herein, that there are no genuine issues of material fact in conflict.
Thus, this matter is ripe for disposition. (FN4)
<P>
II. The Freedom of Speech Claims
<P>
The preliminary question for this court to resolve is whether
the University's SAF qualifies as a &quot;limited public forum&quot;
as the plaintiffs assert, or whether the SAF is in fact a &quot;non-public&quot;
forum, as the defendants argue. This determination is crucial
as it dictates the degree of scrutiny to be used by this court
in reviewing the Board of Visitor Guidelines. (FN5) See Perry
Educ. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (&quot;The existence
of a right of access to public property and the standard by which
limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending
on the character of the property at issue.&quot;) See also Cornelius
v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S.
788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (&quot;the
extent to which the Government may limit access [to a forum] depends
on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.&quot;)
<P>
The phrase &quot;limited public forum&quot; describes one of three
categories of fora identified by the Supreme Court in Perry, supra.
(FN6) A limited public forum is property &quot;which the State
has opened for use by the public even if it was not required to
create the forum in the first place.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at
45, 103 S.Ct. at 955 citing Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102
S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). A state may only restrict access
to limited public fora if such a restriction is narrowly drawn
to effectuate a compelling state interest.
<P>
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. A different category
of property consists of public property which is not &quot;by
tradition or designation a forum for public communication.&quot;
Id. Not surprisingly, this type of property is labeled &quot;nonpublic.&quot;
Access to such a forum can be limited by restrictions which are
&quot; 'reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression
merely because the public officials oppose the speaker's view.'
&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 800, 105 S.Ct. at 3448 quoting Perry,
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
<P>
It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that the label
affixed to the University's SAF (either limited public forum or
nonpublic forum) will have a rather profound impact on whether
the Board's Guidelines will be upheld by this court. The plaintiffs
rely heavily on Gay and Lesbian Students Assn. v. Gohn, 850 F.2d
361 (8th Cir.1988) for the proposition that &quot;compulsory student
activities fees&quot; constitute a limited public forum. In Gohn,
the Gay and Lesbian Students Association (GLSA) at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville challenged the decision of the Student
Senate denying funding to the *179 group. The money was to be
paid out of funds from &quot;tuition, state tax money, and general
fees collected from students.&quot; Id. at 361. In finding that
the denial of funding violated GLSA's First Amendment rights,
the court stated:
<P>
we hold that a public body that chooses to fund speech or expression
must do so even-handedly, without discriminating among recipients
on the basis of their ideology. The University need not supply
funds to student organizations; but once having decided to do
so, it is bound by the First Amendment to act without regard to
the content of the ideas being expressed.
<P>
Id. at 362.
<P>
This court does not read Gohn at holding that a student activities
fund is a limited public forum. Gohn merely stands for the proposition
that  content-based discrimination can be justified only if the
government demonstrates that its regulation is narrowly drawn
and is necessary to effectuate compelling state interests.&quot;
Id. at 367 citing Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270, 102 S.Ct. at 274. The
plaintiffs read this citation to Widmar and the mention of a &quot;compelling
state interest&quot; as a signal that the Eighth Circuit considered
the student activity fee as creating a limited public forum, thus
requiring the use of a heightened level of scrutiny. This reading
of Gohn stretches the Eighth Circuit's opinion beyond the breaking
point.
<P>
The mere mention of heightened scrutiny does not in and of itself
indicate that the court is dealing with either a traditional or
a limited public forum.
<P>
Heightened scrutiny can also be applied even if the forum is characterized
as nonpublic. The Supreme Court recognized this in Perry by stating:
<P>
Public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum
for public communication is governed by different standards. We
have recognized that the 'First Amendment does not guarantee access
to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.'
In addition to time, place, and manner regulations, the State
may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative
or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable
and not an effort to suppress expression merely because the public
officials oppose the speaker's view.
<P>
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955 (citations omitted).
<P>
This passage from Perry indicates that viewpoint discrimination
will rarely be tolerated, regardless of whether the restriction
applies to public, limited or nonpublic fora. Further, a careful
reading of Gohn indicates that the Eighth Circuit considered the
student service funds as creating a nonpublic forum. Specifically,
the court noted that:
<P>
We realize that the District Court made no explicit finding as
to the reason for denial of funding, that this is a question of
fact, and that appellate courts are not fact-finding forums. We
think, though, that the District Court's opinion, when read in
full and in context, includes an implicit finding that funds were
denied because of distaste for the GLSA's ideas. Otherwise, there
would have been no need to resort to the legal doctrines (e.g.
that there is no &quot;right&quot; to public money) used by the
Court to justify dismissing the complaint. A finding of fact that
funds were denied for some content-neutral reason would have sufficed
completely to dispose of the case. In any event, the facts of
this case are so obvious that a remand for an explicit finding
would be a waste of time. This record leaves no reasonable doubt
that funds were denied because of disagreement with GLSA's speech.
(emphasis added).
<P>
Gohn, 850 F.2d at 367. Here, the court indicates that GLSA would
have lost its case had the University of Arkansas put forth a
content neutral reason for denying funding. This is not the standard
used in limited public forum cases, but instead is the standard
used in nonpublic forum situations.
<P>
This court also looks to Cornelius, supra for guidance as to whether
the SAF qualifies as a public forum. Here, the Supreme Court began
its forum analysis by *180 noting that, &quot;[t]he government
does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited
discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional
forum for public discourse.&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802,
105 S.Ct. at 3449 citing Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
(emphasis added). In Cornelius, the Supreme Court held that the
Federal Government could exclude legal defense and political advocacy
organizations from participation in the Combined Federal Campaign
(CFC), a charity drive directed at federal employees. The Court
held that the campaign was a nonpublic forum because:
<P>
[t]he Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation
in the CFC to &quot;appropriate&quot; voluntary agencies and to
require agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal
and local Campaign officials ... The Civil Service Commission
and, after 1978, the Office of Personnel Management developed
extensive criteria to limit access to the Campaign to those organization
considered appropriate. Such selective access, unsupported by
evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not
create a public forum.
<P>
Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 804-5, 105 S.Ct. at 3450 (citations omitted).
<P>
In the present situation, the University has limited eligibility
for SAF monies to those organizations deemed &quot;appropriate.&quot;
Religious organizations are but one of several groups excluded
from participation in the SAF because the Board of Visitors has
decided that such groups do not further the educational purposes
of the University. This exclusion of religious groups and religious
activities has been in effect since the establishment of the Guidelines
in 1970, and has survived revisions in 1973, 1978, 1980 and 1991.

<P>
The plaintiffs attempt to counter this fact by arguing that &quot;the
defendants created the SAF mechanism to encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints among students at the University of
Virginia in furtherance of the educational mission of the University.&quot;
In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs direct the court
to the page 1 of the Guidelines. The Guidelines, in pertinent
part, read as follows:
<P>
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
This court does not read this passage to indicate a desire on
the part of the Board of Visitors to &quot;encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints.&quot; Rather, the Guidelines suggest
that the SAF was established to fund only those CIOs whose activities
contributed to the educational focus of the University. The Board
of Visitors has not opened the SAF coffers to all CIOs; (FN7)
some groups, such as WAP, were excluded simply because the Board
of Visitors determined that their activities were not consistent
with the goals of the University. The consistent, purposeful exclusion
of certain groups indicates that the SAF is indeed a nonpublic
forum.
<P>
This conclusion is further supported by the Supreme Court's reasoning
in Perry, supra. The forum in Perry consisted of an interschool
mailing system used to facilitate communication between various
teachers. A teacher's union challenged the local Board of Education's
decision denying the union access to the system. The plaintiff
union argued that the school mail facilities became a limited
public forum because other private, non-school-connected groups
had previously been given access to the system. Perry, 460 U.S.
at 47, 103 S.Ct.
<P>
at 956. In rejecting this contention, the Court stated:
<P>
The use of the internal school mail by groups not affiliated with
the schools is no doubt a relevant consideration. If by policy
or by practice the Perry School *181 District has opened its mail
system for indiscriminate use by the general public, then PLEA
could justifiably argue a public forum has been created. This,
however, is not the case. As the case comes before us, there is
no indication in the record that the school mailboxes and interschool
delivery system are open for use by the general public. Permission
to use the system to communicate with teachers must be secured
from the individual building principal. There is no court finding
or evidence in the record which demonstrates that this permission
has been granted as a matter of course to all who seek to distribute
material. We can only conclude that the schools do allow some
outside organizations such as the YMCA, Cub Scouts, and other
civic and church organizations to use the facilities. This type
of selective access does not transform government property into
a public forum.
<P>
Id.
<P>
Similarly, the fact that the University has given certain CIOs
access to SAF funds does not lead to the conclusion that such
selective access transforms the SAF into a limited public forum.
<P>
Finally, the plaintiffs reliance on Widmar is misplaced. The present
case might very well be resolved in plaintiffs favor if the University
had denied CIO status to WAP. The defendants themselves take the
position that access to certification as a CIO is a limited public
forum. This is because only CIO's have access to University facilities.
(FN8) This is a far cry from the present situation and is the
reason why this court finds Widmar factually distinguishable from
the case at hand.
<P>
Having concluded that the SAF is a nonpublic forum, this court
must now determine whether the Board's Guidelines constitute restrictions
which are &quot;reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression
merely because public officials oppose the speaker' views.&quot;
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. The defendants offer
two basic rationales for excluding religious organizations such
as WAP from SAF eligibility. First, the University has only limited
funds to disburse and must therefore limit funding to those activities
which it determines advance its educational mission. Second, the
ineligibility of religious organizations and activities is justified
based on the Federal and State constitutional mandate of state
neutrality toward religion.
<P>
Although fiscal restraints are pertinent, this court may resolve
the reasonableness of the Guidelines by reference to the University's
second proffered reason. The parties devote considerable time
in their respective briefs addressing the obvious Establishment
Clause issues raised in this case. However, this court need not
resolve this issue on the facts of this case. For even if the
plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that funding Wide Awake
would not violate Federal or State law, it is not the province
of this court to second guess the legal judgments made by the
University. So long as the University's Establishment Clause fears
are reasonable, the Guideline restriction must stand. Given the
complexity of the law in this regard, this court has little trouble
in finding that the Guideline restriction is a reasonable limit
to access to SAF funds. Further, the restriction is a reasonable
response by the University to prevent excessive entanglement with
religion.
<P>
The court also finds that the Guideline limitations do not result
in viewpoint discrimination against religious organizations such
as WAP. The plaintiffs seem to argue that any across the board
restriction applied to a religious group results in content based
discrimination. This may be *182 true in the abstract, but this
court, and the University, must live in the real world. It could
be argued that every decision by the University results in viewpoint
discrimination. On this point, the court finds Justice Stevens'
comments in his concurring opinion in Widmar to be highly relevant.
Justice Stevens states that:
<P>
In performing their learning and teaching missions, the managers
of a university routinely make countless decisions based on the
content of communicative materials. They select books for inclusion
in the library, they hire professors on the basis of their academic
philosophies, they select courses for inclusion in the curriculum,
and they reward scholars for what they have written. In addition,
in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities,
they necessarily make decisions concerning the content of those
activities.
<P>
Widmar, 454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278.
<P>
In brief, the plaintiffs' complaints about the Guidelines are
more properly directed at the wisdom and not the legality of the
restrictions. This is because the court finds, as a matter of
law, that the Board's Guidelines are reasonable and do not violate
any of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. (FN9)
<P>
III. The Free Exercise of Religion Claims
<P>
The heart of the plaintiffs' claim is that without SAF monies
WAP must devote more time to fund raising and less time to publishing
its religious speech. Thus, the denial of funding burdens the
plaintiffs' free exercise of religion by diverting energy away
from WAP's main goal: challenging Christians to live according
to their faith.
<P>
Both sides agree that this court's analysis should begin with
Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389 (4th Cir.) cert.
denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 131, 112 L.Ed.2d 99 (1990). Here,
the Fourth Circuit stated that in reviewing a free exercise claim,
a court should:
<P>
... examine the burden on the exercise of ... [plaintiff's] sincerely
held religious beliefs, then determine whether the state presents
a compelling justification for imposing this burden, and finally
balancing the burden on free exercise against the state's ...
[compelling interest].
<P>
Id. at 1397.
<P>
In the present case, it is difficult for this court to identify
any burden of constitutional magnitude that has been imposed on
the plaintiffs. It is logical to assume that publishing a magazine
is easier if someone else pays the bills. However, if this incidental
burden was of constitutional significance, the free exercise clause
would be implicated in every funding decision involving a religious
organization. A review of the record indicates that WAP is unable
to point to any facts making their burden unique from other CIOs
which have been denied SAF monies. Political groups and fraternities
and sororities share a common plight with WAP: none of these groups
is eligible for funding. The only distinguishing factor is that
WAP engages in religious activity. However, WAP has not cited
this court to any authority indicating that religious organizations
should receive preferential access to a nonpublic forum.
<P>
The plaintiffs' attempt to bridge this gap in their argument by
asserting that &quot;freedom of expression may not be infringed
by denying a privilege.&quot;
<P>
WAP relies on Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct.
1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) to support this position. This
court does not read Sherbert as broadly as do the plaintiffs.
In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S.
872, 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1602, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), the Court
stated that, &quot;[u]nder the Sherbert test, governmental actions
that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest.&quot; (emphasis added).
This language *183 itself indicates that a burden must be substantial
before the court will consider whether the state has a compelling
reason for the restriction. (FN10) The Fourth Circuit appears
to have adopted this position in Goodall v. Stafford County School
Board, 930 F.2d 363 (4th Cir.) cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 188, 116 L.Ed.2d 149 (1991). Here the court stated that
[w]here the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon
conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such
a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby
putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior
and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While
the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise
is nonetheless substantial.
<P>
Goodall, 930 F.2d at 369 quoting Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana
Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct.
1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). (FN11)
<P>
Even if this court were to consider the Board's Guidelines as
imposing a burden on WAP's free exercise of religion, WAP is still
bound by the Fourth Circuit's holding in Goodall, supra, that
avoidance of a violation of the Establishment Clause constitutes
a compelling state interest. Goodall, 930 F.2d at 370. Further,
balancing the minimal burden on the plaintiffs with the defendants
rationale for the Guidelines indicates that the scale must come
down in favor of the defendants.
<P>
IV. The Equal Protection Claims
<P>
The last issue for the court to resolve in the plaintiffs' claims
that the Guidelines have been applied in less than an even-handed
manner. Put somewhat differently, the plaintiffs contend that
they have been denied equal protection of the laws because other
&quot;religious groups&quot; have been given SAF monies. As evidence
of this unequal treatment, WAP focuses on the funding decisions
make with respect to other CIOs.
<P>
The defendants seek to counter this argument by citing this court
to Irby v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Irby stands for the proposition that a plaintiff challenging
a facially neutral statute with an equal protection claim must
show not only disparate effect, but also discriminatory intent.
Thus, the defendants do not argue that the Student Council's funding
decisions are always correct. Instead, the defendants argue that
there is no evidence to suggest that the Student Council's decision
to deny funding to WAP resulted from discriminatory intent.
<P>
In their reply brief, the plaintiffs do not dispute the defendants
statement of the law nor the facts on this issue. The court has
reviewed the entire record independently, and cannot find any
evidence to indicate that the decision to deny funding to WAP
was based on discriminatory intent. Accordingly, summary judgment
in favor of the defendants is appropriate.
<P>
In summary, the court holds that access to the SAF is a nonpublic
forum upon which the University has imposed reasonable restrictions.
These restrictions do not impose an impermissible burden on the
plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by either the
Federal or State Constitutions, or the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom. Thus, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and grants the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.
An appropriate order shall this day issue.
<P>
ORDER
<P>
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum opinion,
it is hereby *184.
<P>
ADJUDGED AND ORDERED
<P>
that:
<P>
1. The plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied;
<P>
2. The defendants' cross motion for summary judgment is granted.
<P>
This case shall be dismissed and stricken from the docket of the
court. The Clerk of the Court is hereby directed to send a certified
copy of this Order to all counsel of record.
<P>
FN1. There are four general criteria for CIO status: (1) at least
fifty-one percent of the group's members must be students; (2)
the group's officers must all be full-time, fee-paying students;
(3) the group must keep an updated copy of its constitution on
file with the University; and (4) the group must sign an anti-discrimination
disclaimer.
<P>
FN2. The individual Board members and Mr. Robert Stump, Associate
Dean of Students, are named defendants and are being sued in their
official capacities.
<P>
FN3. Mr. Rosenberger admits that Wide Awake is written from a
&quot;religious perspective.&quot; Further, Article 1 of WAP's
constitution states that the purpose of the organization is to:
(1) publish a magazine of philosophical and religious expressions;
(2) facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity
to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints; and (3) provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.
<P>
FN4. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs'
claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the grounds that
such a claim is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United
States Constitution. The court need not address this issue as
it has determined that all of the plaintiffs' claims must fail,
as a matter of law.
<P>
FN5. The plaintiffs have launched a general assault on the propriety
of certain exclusions in the Guidelines; i.e. those prohibiting
the funding of religious organizations and activities. Alternatively,
the plaintiffs set forth an equal protection claim by arguing
that the Guidelines have not been applied in an even-handed manner.
The court will address the equal protection issue in part IV of
this opinion.
<P>
FN6. The plaintiffs do not argue that the SAF is a traditional
public forum.
<P>
FN7. For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations
qualified as CIOs. Of these 135 applied for SAF funds and 118
were actually allotted SAF monies.
<P>
FN8. The plaintiffs allege that they have been denied access to
certain University facilities yet have presented no evidence,
beyond Mr. Rosenberger's affidavit, to support of this claim.
For instance, there is no assertion that WAP has even attempted
to use University facilities or computers. The defendants have
submitted the affidavit of Mr. Stump, who swears that &quot;[a]s
a CIO, Wide Awake has been and is accorded the same access and
use of University facilities as other CIOs.&quot; The court has
considered this conflicting evidence in the light most favorable
to the plaintiffs, but comes to the conclusion that WAP has not
raised a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue.
<P>
FN9. In their briefs and in oral argument, the parties did not
separately address plaintiffs' claims under Federal and State
law. Although the court has focused on Federal Constitutional
law, the preceding analysis applies to the plaintiffs' claims
based on the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom.
<P>
FN10. The court notes that the plaintiffs have not identified
a religious practice which is infringed by the Board's Guidelines.
Apparently the plaintiffs contend that publishing a religious
magazine is itself a religious practice.
<P>
FN11. The court also notes that with few exceptions, Sherbert
has been limited to those cases involving the denial of unemployment
compensation benefits. See Smith, supra, 494 U.S. at 883, 110
S.Ct. at 1602.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated
association of individuals elected from various veterans groups,
was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the
St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a
place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed
for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express
its members' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian,
and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals
in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought
to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB and some
of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the
denial of their application to march violated, inter alia, a state
law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation
in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation
and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial
court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common
theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that,
given the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants
and its failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade
lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein
would not violate the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.
<P>
Held: The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public
accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a
parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message
that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment.
Pp. 2343-2351.
<P>
(a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual
characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm
of non-expressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty
to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole,
without deference to those courts, to assure that *2340 their
judgment does not constitute a forbidden
<P>
intrusion on the field of free expression. See, e.g., New York
Times Co. v.
<P>
Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.
Pp.
<P>
2343-2345.
<P>
(b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled
to First Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are
a form of protected expression because they include marchers who
are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other
but to bystanders along the way. Cf., e.g., Gregory v. Chicago,
394 U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 946, 22 L.Ed.2d 134. Moreover,
such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs,
but extends to symbolic acts. See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182,
1187, 87 L.Ed. 1628. Although the Council has been rather lenient
in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does
not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious
voices, by failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific
message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech, or by failing
to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the
communication. Thus, petitioners are entitled to protection under
the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade
was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate
its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 2345-2346.
<P>
(c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within
a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that
a given group is being discriminated against. And the statute
does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis
of its content. Pp. 2346-2347.
<P>
(d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of
declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.
Since every participating parade unit affects the message conveyed
by the private organizers, the state courts' peculiar application
of the Massachusetts law essentially forced the Council to alter
the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental
First Amendment rule that a speaker has the autonomy to choose
the content of his own message and, conversely, to decide what
not to say. Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle
is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the
parade from potential participants and clearly decided to exclude
a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make,
and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to
shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining
silent on another, free from state interference. The constitutional
violation is not saved by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497. The Council
is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of individual,
unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for
individual selection by members of the audience; and there is
no assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the
absence of the Massachusetts law. Nor has any other legitimate
interest been identified in support of applying that law in the
way done by the state courts to expressive activity like the parade.

Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The issue in this case is whether Massachusetts may require private
citizens who *2341 organize a parade to include among the marchers
a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.
We hold that such a mandate violates the First Amendment.
<P>
I
<P>
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston. As
early as 1737, some people in Boston observed the feast of the
apostle to Ireland, and since 1776 the day has marked the evacuation
of royal troops and Loyalists from the city, prompted by the guns
captured at Ticonderoga and set up on Dorchester Heights under
General Washington's command. Washington himself reportedly drew
on the earlier tradition in choosing &quot;St. Patrick&quot; as
the response to &quot;Boston,&quot; the password used in the colonial
lines on evacuation day. See J. Crimmins, St. Patrick's Day: Its
Celebration in New York and other American Places, 1737-1845,
pp. 15, 19 (1902); see generally 1 H.S. Commager &amp; R. Morris,
The Spirit of 'Seventy Six 138-183 (1958); The American Book of
Days 262-265 (J. Hatch ed., 3d ed. 1978). Although the General
Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as
Evacuation Day until 1938, see Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 6:12K (1992),
the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored public celebrations
of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial
in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in 1901, with its parade,
salute, concert, and fireworks display. See Celebration of the
Centennial Anniversary of the Evacuation of Boston by the British
Army (G. Ellis ed. 1876); Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston v. City of Boston et al., Civ.Action No. 92-1516
(Super.Ct., Mass., Dec. 15, 1993), reprinted in App. to Pet. for
Cert. B1, B8-B9.
<P>
The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end
in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted
authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation
Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans
Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected
from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that
time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for the
parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers
and drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever
applied for that permit. Id., at B9. Through 1992, the city allowed
the Council to use the city's official seal, and provided printing
services as well as direct funding.
<P>
1992 was the year that a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual
descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other
supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march
in the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage
as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate
that there are such men and women among those so descended, and
to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to
march in New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Id., at B3; App.
51. Although the Council denied GLIB's application to take part
in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include
its contingent, which marched &quot;uneventfully&quot; among that
year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet.
for Cert. B3, and n. 4.
<P>
In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to
the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its members
filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner
John J. &quot;Wacko&quot; Hurley, and the City of Boston, alleging
violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state
public accommodations law, which prohibits &quot;any distinction,
discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation
... relative to the admission of any person to, or treatment in
any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. After finding that &quot;[f]or at least
the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route
along the public streets of South Boston, providing entertainment,
amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,&quot;
App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that
the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation,
which includes &quot;any place ... which is open to and accepts
or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting
*2342 the generality of this definition, whether or not it be
... (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] ... (8) a place
of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:92A. The court found that the Council had
no written criteria and employed no particular procedures for
admission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally
admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade without having
submitted an application, and did &quot;not generally inquire
into the specific messages or views of each applicant.&quot; App.
to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council's
contention that the parade was &quot;private&quot; (in the sense
of being exclusive), holding instead that &quot;the lack of genuine
selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates
that the Parade is a public event.&quot; Id., at B6. It found
the parade to be &quot;eclectic,&quot; containing a wide variety
of &quot;patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious,
athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes,&quot;
as well as conflicting messages. Id., at B24. While noting that
the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an
antibusing group), id., at B7, it attributed little significance
to these facts, concluding ultimately that &quot;[t]he only common
theme among the participants and sponsors is their public involvement
in the Parade,&quot; id., at B24.
<P>
The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion
of &quot;groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the fact]
that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values,&quot;
id., at B3, and found the Council's &quot;final position [to be]
that GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message,
i.e., its members' sexual orientation,&quot; id., at B4, n. 5,
citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993). This position,
in the court's view, was not only violative of the public accommodations
law but &quot;paradoxical&quot; as well, since &quot;a proper
celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity
and inclusiveness.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. B24. The court
rejected the notion that GLIB's admission would trample on the
Council's First Amendment rights since the court understood that
constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association
would &quot;requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group&quot;
absent from the parade. Ibid. &quot;Given the [Council's] lack
of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to circumscribe
the marchers' message,&quot; the court found it &quot;impossible
to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade
to protection under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at B25. It
concluded that the parade is &quot;not an exercise of [the Council's]
constitutionally protected right of expressive association,&quot;
but instead &quot;an open recreational event that is subject to
the public accommodations law.&quot; Id., at B27.
<P>
The court held that because the statute did not mandate inclusion
of GLIB but only prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation,
any infringement on the Council's right to expressive association
was only &quot;incidental&quot; and &quot;no greater than necessary
to accomplish the statute's legitimate purpose&quot; of eradicating
discrimination. Id., at B25, citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U.S. 609, 628-629, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255-3256, 82 L.Ed.2d 462
(1984). Accordingly, it ruled that &quot;GLIB is entitled to participate
in the Parade on the same terms and conditions as other participants.&quot;
Id., at B27. (FN1)
<P>
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, seeing nothing
clearly erroneous in the trial judge's findings that GLIB was
excluded from the parade based on the sexual orientation of its
members, that it was impossible to detect an expressive purpose
in the parade, that there was no state action, and that the parade
was a public accommodation within the meaning of Sec. 272:92A.

Irish- *2343 American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston
v. Boston, 418 Mass. 238, 242-248, 636 N.E.2d 1293, 1295-1298
(1994). (FN2) Turning to petitioners' First Amendment claim that
application of the public accommodations law to the parade violated
their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to
expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court's
majority held that it need not decide on the particular First
Amendment theory involved &quot;because, as the [trial] judge
found, it is 'impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose
entitling the parade to protection under the First Amendment.'
&quot; Id., at 249, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299 (footnote omitted). The
defendants had thus failed at the trial level &quot;to demonstrate
that the parade truly was an exercise of ... First Amendment rights,&quot;
id., at 250, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299, citing Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293, n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065,
3069, n. 5, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated
to the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial judge's
assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly erroneous,
ibid. The court rejected petitioners' further challenge to the
law as overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate
speech, does not let public officials examine the content of speech,
and would not be interpreted as reaching speech. Id., at 251-252,
636 N.E.2d, at 1300. Finally, the court rejected the challenge
that the public accommodations law was unconstitutionally vague,
holding that this case did not present an issue of speech and
that the law gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what was prohibited. Id., at 252, 636 N.E.2d,
at 1300-1301.
<P>
Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council &quot;does not
need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it
to be protected under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at 256,
636 N.E.2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the parade had no
message at all, GLIB's particular message could not be forced
upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303, citing Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977)
(state requirement to display &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; on
license plates violates First Amendment). Second, according to
Justice Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade
devoid of expressive purpose. Ibid. He would have held that the
Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from
excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes
to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303-1304, citing
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). Under either a pure speech or associational
theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could be
achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission
of individuals regardless of sexual preference, without taking
the further step of prohibiting the Council from editing the views
expressed in their parade. Id., at 256, 258, 636 N.E.2d, at 1302,
1304. In Justice Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable
from the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate
the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the
Council's First Amendment rights. Finally, he found clear error
in the trial judge's equation of exclusion on the basis of GLIB's
message with exclusion on the basis of its members' sexual orientation.
To the dissent this appeared false in the light of &quot;overwhelming
evidence&quot; that the Council objected to GLIB on account of
its message and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating
that sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260,
636 N.E.2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the
Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations
law.
<P>
We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to
admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private
organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U.S.
----, 115 S.Ct. 714, 130 L.Ed.2d 621 (1995). We hold that it does
and reverse.

<P>
Given the scope of the issues as originally joined in this case,
it is worth noting some that have fallen aside in the course of
the litigation, before
<P>
reaching us. Although the Council presents us with a First Amendment
claim, respondents do not. Neither do they press a claim that
the Council's action has denied them equal protection of the laws
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the guarantees
of free speech and equal protection guard only against encroachment
by the government and &quot;erec[t] no shield against merely private
conduct,&quot; Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836,
842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507,
513, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 1033, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), respondents originally
argued that the Council's conduct was not purely private, but
had the character of state action. The trial court's review of
the city's involvement led it to find otherwise, however, and
although the Supreme Judicial Court did not squarely address the
issue, it appears to have affirmed the trial court's decision
on that point as well as the others. In any event, respondents
have not brought that question up either in a cross-petition for
certiorari or in their briefs filed in this Court. When asked
at oral argument whether they challenged the conclusion by the
Massachusetts' courts that no state action is involved in the
parade, respondents' counsel answered that they &quot;do not press
that issue here.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. In this Court, then,
their claim for inclusion in the parade rests solely on the Massachusetts
public accommodations law.
<P>
There is no corresponding concession from the other side, however,
and certainly not to the state courts' characterization of the
parade as lacking the element of expression for purposes of the
First Amendment. Accordingly, our review of petitioners' claim
that their activity is indeed in the nature of protected speech
carries with it a constitutional duty to conduct an independent
examination of the record as a whole, without deference to the
trial court. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1958, 80 L.Ed.2d 502
(1984). The &quot;requirement of independent appellate review
... is a rule of federal constitutional law,&quot; id., at 510,
104 S.Ct., at 1965, which does not limit our deference to a trial
court on matters of witness credibility, Harte-Hanks Communications,
Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 688, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2696,
105 L.Ed.2d 562 (1989), but which generally requires us to &quot;review
the finding of facts by a State court ... where a conclusion of
law as to a Federal right and a finding of fact are so intermingled
as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the Federal question,
to analyze the facts,&quot; Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380, 385-386,
47 S.Ct. 655, 656-657, 71 L.Ed. 1108 (1927). See also Niemotko
v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 271, 71 S.Ct. 325, 327, 95 L.Ed. 267
(1951); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 189, 84 S.Ct. 1676,
1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (opinion of Brennan, J.). This obligation
rests upon us simply because the reaches of the First Amendment
are ultimately defined by the facts it is held to embrace, and
we must thus decide for ourselves whether a given course of conduct
falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.
See Bose Corp., supra, at 503, 104 S.Ct. at 1961. Even where a
speech case has originally been tried in a federal court, subject
to the provision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) that
&quot;[f]indings of fact ... shall not be set aside unless clearly
erroneous,&quot; we are obliged to make a fresh examination of
crucial facts. Hence, in this case, though we are confronted with
the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics
of petitioners' activity place it within the vast realm of non-expressive
conduct, our obligation is to &quot; 'make an independent examination
of the whole record,' ... so as to assure ourselves that th[is]
judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field
of free expression.&quot; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (footnote
omitted), quoting Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235,
83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963).

If there were no reason for a group of people to march from here
to there except to *2345 reach a destination, they could make
the trip without expressing any message beyond the fact of the
march itself. Some people might call such a procession a parade,
but it would not be much of one. Real &quot;[p]arades are public
dramas of social relations, and in them performers define who
can be a social actor and what subjects and ideas are available
for communication and consideration.&quot; S. Davis, Parades and
Power: Street Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia 6 (1986).
Hence, we use the word &quot;parade&quot; to indicate marchers
who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each
other but to bystanders along the way. Indeed a parade's dependence
on watchers is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's
celebrated tree, &quot;if a parade or demonstration receives no
media coverage, it may as well not have happened.&quot; Id., at
171. Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and
the inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains
our cases involving protest marches. In Gregory v. Chicago, 394
U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 947, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969), for example,
petitioners had taken part in a procession to express their grievances
to the city government, and we held that such a &quot;march, if
peaceful and orderly, falls well within the sphere of conduct
protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Similarly, in Edwards
v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d
697 (1963), where petitioners had joined in a march of protest
and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner,
we held that the activities &quot;reflect an exercise of these
basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic
form.&quot; Accord, Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147,
152, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969).
<P>
The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited
to its banners and songs, however, for the Constitution looks
beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression. Noting
that &quot;[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas,&quot; West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,
632, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), our cases have
recognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting
a flag (and refusing to do so), id., at 632, 642, 63 S.Ct., at
1182, 1187, wearing an arm band to protest a war, Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-506,
89 S.Ct. 733, 735-736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), displaying a red
flag, Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532,
535, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and even &quot;[m]arching, walking
or parading&quot; in uniforms displaying the swastika, National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205,
53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977). As some of these examples show, a narrow,
succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional
protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a &quot;particularized
message,&quot; cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 411, 94
S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam ), would never
reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock,
music of Arnold Schonberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.
<P>
Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades,
and the South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators
line the streets; people march in costumes and uniforms, carrying
flags and banners with all sorts of messages (e.g., &quot;England
get out of Ireland,&quot; &quot;Say no to drugs&quot;); marching
bands and pipers play, floats are pulled along, and the whole
show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84
(video). To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite
of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in
admitting participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit
constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices,
or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message
as the exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our
precedent, does First Amendment protection require a speaker to
generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication.
Cable operators, for example, are engaged in protected speech
activities even when they only select programming originally produced
by others. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----,
----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2456, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (slip op.,
at 11) (&quot;Cable programmers and cable operators engage in
and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the *2346 protection
of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment&quot;).
For that matter, the presentation of an edited compilation of
speech generated by other persons is a staple of most newspapers'
opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core
of First Amendment security, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 2840, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974),
as does even the simple selection of a paid noncommercial advertisement
for inclusion in a daily paper, see New York Times, 376 U.S.,
at 265-266, 84 S.Ct., at 718-719. The selection of contingents
to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.
<P>
Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally
expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in
it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members'
identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the
Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the
community, and to support the like men and women who sought to
march in the New York parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization
distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions, App.
A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature
of GLIB's participation, see Record, Exh. 84; App. A67 (photograph).
In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner
with the simple inscription &quot;Irish American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston.&quot; GLIB understandably seeks
to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather
than staging one of its own.

The Massachusetts public accommodations law under which respondents
brought suit has a venerable history. At common law, innkeepers,
smiths, and others who &quot;made profession of a public employment,&quot;
were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer. Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484-485, 88 Eng.Rep. 1458,
1464-1465 (K.B.1701) (Holt, C.J.); see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S.
226, 298, n. 17, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 1853, n. 17, 12 L.Ed.2d 822 (1964)
(Goldberg, J., concurring); Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267,
277, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 1127, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963) (Douglas, J.,
concurring). As one of the 19th century English judges put it,
the rule was that &quot;[t]he innkeeper is not to select his guests[;]
[h]e has no right to say to one, you shall come into my inn, and
to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself
in a proper manner has a right to be received; and for this purpose
innkeepers are a sort of public servants.&quot; Rex v. Ivens,
7 Car. &amp; P. 213, 219, 173 Eng.Rep. 94, 96 (N.P.1835); M. Konvitz
&amp; T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights 160 (1961).
<P>
After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the
first State to codify this principle to ensure access to public
accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination
on Account of Color or Race, 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16,
1865); Konvitz &amp; Leskes, supra, at 155-56; L.G. Lerman &amp;
A. Sanderson, Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey
of State and Federal Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U.Rev.L.
&amp; Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978); F. Fox, Discrimination and
Antidiscrimination in Massachusetts Law, 44 B.U.L.Rev. 30, 58
(1964). In prohibiting discrimination &quot;in any licensed inn,
in any public place of amusement, public conveyance or public
meeting,&quot; 1865 Mass.Acts, ch. 277, Sec. 1, the original statute
already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred
any right of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &amp;
Anderson, supra, at 248. As with many public accommodations statutes
across the Nation, the legislature continued to broaden the scope
of legislation, to the point that the law today prohibits discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religious creed, national origin,
sex, sexual orientation ..., deafness, blindness or any physical
or mental disability or ancestry&quot; in &quot;the admission
of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation,
resort or amusement.&quot; Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. Provisions
like these are well within the State's usual power to enact when
a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the
target of discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter,
violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., New York
State Club Assn., Inc. v. City *2347 of New York, 487 U.S. 1,
11-16, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2233-2236, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-626, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
3253-3254, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.
v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258-262, 85 S.Ct. 348, 358-360,
13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964). Nor is this statute unusual in any obvious
way, since it does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate
on the basis of its content, the focal point of its prohibition
being rather on the act of discriminating against individuals
in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and
services on the proscribed grounds.
<P>
C
<P>
In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been
applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any
dispute about the participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual
individuals in various units admitted to the parade. The petitioners
disclaim any intent to exclude homosexuals as such, and no individual
member of GLIB claims to have been excluded from parading as a
member of any group that the Council has approved to march. Instead,
the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade
unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B26-B27,
and n. 28. Since every participating unit affects the message
conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' application
of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners
to alter the expressive content of their parade. Although the
state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation,
see, e.g., 418 Mass., at 247-248, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297-1298, once
the expressive character of both the parade and the marching GLIB
contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors'
speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under this approach
any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have
the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication
produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those
protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive
demonstration of their own. But this use of the State's power
violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment,
that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own
message.
<P>
&quot;Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to
say and what to leave unsaid,&quot; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 11, 106 S.Ct.
903, 909, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in
original), one important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide &quot;what
not to say,&quot; id., at 16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Although the
State may at times &quot;prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial
advertising&quot; by requiring the dissemination of &quot;purely
factual and uncontroversial information,&quot; Zauderer v. Office
of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626,
651, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 2281, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985); see Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376,
386-387, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2559-2560, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), outside
that context it may not compel affirmance of a belief with which
the speaker disagrees, see Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642, 63 S.Ct.,
at 1187. Indeed this general rule, that the speaker has the right
to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions of value,
opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the
speaker would rather avoid, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,
514 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d
426 (1995); Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc.,
487 U.S. 781, 797-798, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 2678, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988),
subject, perhaps, to the permissive law of defamation, New York
Times, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,
418 U.S. 323, 347-349, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789
(1974); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct.
876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Nor is the rule's benefit restricted
to the press, being enjoyed by business corporations generally
and by ordinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as
well as by professional publishers. Its point is simply the point
of all speech protection, which is to *2348 shield just those
choices of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even
hurtful. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827,
23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69
S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949).
<P>
Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy
to control one's own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade
is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the
expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and
though the score may not produce a particularized message, each
contingent's expression in the Council's eyes comports with what
merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council
credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the
Council clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from
the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke
its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking
on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message
it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point
(like the Council's) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching
behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to
the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the
presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that
people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified
social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade
units organized around other identifying characteristics. The
parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality
to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance
of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to
keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason,
it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular
point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's
power to control.
<P>
Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and the Massachusetts
law falls short of unconstitutionality, citing the most recent
of our cases on the general subject of compelled access for expressive
purposes, Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445.
There we reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set
aside channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only
intermediate scrutiny. Id., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2469. Respondents
contend on this authority that admission of GLIB to the parade
would not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy because
the Council, like a cable operator, is merely &quot;a conduit&quot;
for the speech of participants in the parade &quot;rather than
itself a speaker.&quot; Brief for Respondent 21. But this metaphor
is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would likely be
perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination
about a unit admitted to the parade, that its message was worthy
of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper,
similarly, &quot;is more than a passive receptacle or conduit
for news, comment, and advertising,&quot; and we have held that
&quot;[t]he choice of material ... and the decisions made as to
limitations on the size and content ... and treatment of public
issues ...--whether fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of
editorial control and judgment&quot; upon which the State can
not intrude. Tornillo, 418 U.S., at 258, 94 S.Ct., at 2840. Indeed,
in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, we invalidated coerced access to
the envelope of a private utility's bill and newsletter because
the utility &quot;may be forced either to appear to agree with
[the intruding leaflet] or to respond.&quot; 475 U.S., at 15,
106 S.Ct., at 911 (plurality) (citation omitted). The plurality
made the further point that if &quot;the government [were] freely
able to compel ... speakers to propound political messages with
which they disagree, ... protection [of a speaker's freedom] would
be empty, for the government could require speakers to affirm
in one breath that which they deny in the next.&quot; Id., at
16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary
to one's own is forced upon a speaker intimately connected with
the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over
the message is compromised.
<P>
In Turner Broadcasting, we found this problem absent in the cable
context, because &quot;[g]iven cable's long history of serving
as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk
that cable viewers would assume *2349 that the broadcast stations
carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by
the cable operator.&quot; 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2465.
We stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity
of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via cable and
that it is &quot;common practice for broadcasters to disclaim
any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers
who use the broadcast facility.&quot; Ibid., 512 U.S., at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2466 (citation omitted); see id., at ----, 114 S.Ct.,
at 2480 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(noting that Congress &quot;might ... conceivably obligate cable
operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels&quot;).
<P>
Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to
be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming
offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does
not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be
transmitted together for individual selection by members of the
audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself,
each is understood to contribute something to a common theme,
and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private
sponsors disavow &quot;any identity of viewpoint&quot; between
themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability
here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving
parade. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74,
87, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2044, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980) (owner of shopping
mall &quot;can expressly disavow any connection with the message
by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers
stand&quot;). Without deciding on the precise significance of
the likelihood of misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear
that in the context of an expressive parade, as with a protest
march, the parade's overall message is distilled from the individual
presentations along the way, and each unit's expression is perceived
by spectators as part of the whole.
<P>
An additional distinction between Turner Broadcasting and this
case points to the fundamental weakness of any attempt to justify
the state court order's limitation on the Council's autonomy as
a speaker. A cable is not only a conduit for speech produced by
others and selected by cable operators for transmission, but a
franchised channel giving monopolistic opportunity to shut out
some speakers. This power gives rise to the government's interest
in limiting monopolistic autonomy in order to allow for the survival
of broadcasters who might otherwise be silenced and consequently
destroyed. The government's interest in Turner Broadcasting was
not the alteration of speech, but the survival of speakers. In
thus identifying an interest going beyond abridgment of speech
itself, the defenders of the law at issue in Turner Broadcasting
addressed the threshold requirement of any review under the Speech
Clause, whatever the ultimate level of scrutiny, that a challenged
restriction on speech serve a compelling, or at least important,
governmental object, see, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra,
at 19, 106 S.Ct., at 913; Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2469; United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377,
88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to the
Turner Broadcasting claim that some speakers will be destroyed
in the absence of the challenged law. True, the size and success
of petitioners' parade makes it an enviable vehicle for the dissemination
of GLIB's views, but that fact, without more, would fall far short
of supporting a claim that petitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly
of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9;
<P>
Brief for Respondents 10 (citing trial court's finding that no
other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that
GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria
developed by the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own,
respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity
to &quot;silence the voice of competing speakers,&quot; as cable
operators do with respect to program providers who wish to reach
subscribers, Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at
2466. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in
support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive
activity like the parade. *2350 The statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Sec.
272:98, is a piece of protective legislation that announces no
purpose beyond the object both expressed and apparent in its provisions,
which is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory
treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including
sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law is to ensure
by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make use of public
accommodations what the old common law promised to any member
of the public wanting a meal at the inn, that accepting the usual
terms of service, they will not be turned away merely on the proprietor's
exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive
activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply
to require speakers to modify the content of their expression
to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it
with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further,
legitimate end, this object is merely to allow exactly what the
general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.
<P>
It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective
is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of discrimination
toward certain classes is to produce a society free of the corresponding
biases.
<P>
Requiring access to a speaker's message would thus be not an end
in itself, but a means to produce speakers free of the biases,
whose expressive conduct would be at least neutral toward the
particular classes, obviating any future need for correction.
But if this indeed is the point of applying the state law to expressive
conduct, it is a decidedly fatal objective. Having availed itself
of the public thoroughfares &quot;for purposes of assembly [and]
communicating thoughts between citizens,&quot; the Council is
engaged in a use of the streets that has &quot;from ancient times,
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties
of citizens.&quot; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization,
307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion
of Roberts, J.). Our tradition of free speech commands that a
speaker who takes to the street corner to express his views in
this way should be free from interference by the State based on
the content of what he says. See, e.g., Police Department of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212
(1972); cf. H. Kalven, Jr., A Worthy Tradition 6-19 (1988); O.
Fiss, Free Speech and Social Structure, 71 Iowa L.Rev. 1405, 1408-1409
(1986). The very idea that a noncommercial speech restriction
be used to produce thoughts and statements acceptable to some
groups or, indeed, all people, grates on the First Amendment,
for it amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech
in the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has no
more certain antithesis. See, e.g., Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642,
63 S.Ct., at 1187; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 475 U.S., at 20,
106 S.Ct., at 914. While the law is free to promote all sorts
of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it is not free to interfere
with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message
or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose
may strike the government.
<P>
Far from supporting GLIB, then, Turner Broadcasting points to
the reasons why the present application of the Massachusetts law
can not be sustained. So do the two other principal authorities
GLIB has cited. In PruneYard, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S.Ct. 2035, to
be sure, we sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of
shopping malls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political
petitions without a showing that the shopping mall owners would
otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from reaching an
audience. But we found in that case that the proprietors were
running &quot;a business establishment that is open to the public
to come and go as they please,&quot; that the solicitations would
&quot;not likely be identified with those of the owner,&quot;
and that the proprietors could &quot;expressly disavow any connection
with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the
speakers or handbillers stand.&quot; Id., at 87, 100 S.Ct., at
2044. Also, in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra, at 12, 106 S.Ct.,
at 909, we noted that PruneYard did not involve &quot;any concern
that access to this area might affect the shopping center owner's
exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege
that he objected to the content of the pamphlets....&quot; The
principle of speaker's *2351. autonomy was simply not threatened
in that case.
<P>
New York State Club Association is also instructive by the contrast
it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge to a state
antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that the expressive
associational character of a dining club with over 400 members
could be sufficiently attenuated to permit application of the
law even to such a private organization, but we also recognized
that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views
were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships.
487 U.S., at 13, 108 S.Ct. at 2234; see also Roberts, 468 U.S.,
at 627, 104 S.Ct. at 3254. In other words, although the association
provided public benefits to which a State could ensure equal access,
it was also engaged in expressive activity; compelled access to
the benefit, which was upheld, did not trespass on the organization's
message itself. If we were to analyze this case strictly along
those lines, GLIB would lose. Assuming the parade to be large
enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that
would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with
its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude
an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position
taken by the club's existing members.
<P>
IV
<P>
Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's
message but on the Nation's commitment to protect freedom of speech.
<P>
Disapproval of a private speaker's statement does not legitimize
use of the Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter
the message by including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed and the
case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.

FN1. The court dismissed the public accommodations law claim against
the city because it found that the city's actions did not amount
to inciting or assisting in the Council's violations of Sec. 272:98.
App. to Pet. for Cert. B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents'
First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for
want of state action triggering the proscriptions of those Amendments.
Id., at B14-B22. Finally, the court did not reach the state constitutional
questions, since respondents had apparently assumed in their arguments
that those claims, too, depended for their success upon a finding
of state action and because of the court's holding that the public
accommodation statutes apply to the parade. Id., at B22.
<P>
FN2. Since respondents did not cross-appeal the dismissal of their
claims against the city, the Supreme Judicial Court declined to
reach those claims. 418 Mass., at 245, n. 12, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297.

R.A.V., Petitioner, v.
<P>
CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.
<P>
No. 90-7675.
<P>
Argued Dec. 4, 1991.
<P>
Decided June 22, 1992.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2540
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner
R.A.V. was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota,
Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of
a symbol which one knows or has reason to know &quot;arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion or gender.&quot; The trial court dismissed this charge
on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and
impermissibly content-based, but the State Supreme Court reversed.
It rejected the overbreadth claim because the phrase &quot;arouses
anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot; had been construed
in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to &quot;fighting
words&quot; within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment.
The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated
threats to public safety and order.
<P>
Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment.
Pp.
<P>
2542-2550.
<P>
(a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting &quot;fighting
words.&quot; However, R.A.V.'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky
formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as
substantially overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance
unconstitutionally prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects
the speech addresses. P. 2542.
<P>
(b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation,
and fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally
proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely
invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate
them based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable
message they contain. Thus the regulation of &quot;fighting words&quot;
may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however,
be underinclusive, addressing some offensive instances and leaving
other, equally offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective
prescription is not based on content, or there is no realistic
possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 2542-2547.
<P>
(c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme
Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on the disfavored
subjects of &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
At the same time, it permits displays containing abusive invective
if they are not addressed to those topics. Moreover, in its practical
operation the ordinance goes beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint,
discrimination. Displays containing &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be
useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color,
etc. tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's
desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone
the &quot;group hatred&quot; of bias-motivated speech does not
justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content.
Pp. 2547-2549.
<P>
(d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance
does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of
speech at issue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the &quot;secondary
effects&quot; *2541 of speech within the meaning of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d
29, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not
threaten censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content
discrimination is not justified on the ground that the ordinance
is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in ensuring
the basic human rights of groups historically discriminated against,
since an ordinance not limited to the favored topics would have
precisely the same beneficial effect. Pp. 2549-2550.

<P>
Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several
other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely-made cross by taping
together broken chair legs. They then allegedly burned the cross
inside the fenced yard of a black family that lived across the
street from the house where petitioner was staying. Although this
conduct could have been punished under any of a number of laws,
(FN1) one of the two provisions under which respondent city of
St. Paul chose to charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the
St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn.Legis.Code
Sec. 292.02 (1990), which provides:
<P>
&quot;Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object,
appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not
limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows
or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender
commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot;
<P>
Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the
St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly
content-based and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment.
(FN2) The trial court granted this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme
Court reversed. That court rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim
because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases, see, e.g., In
re Welfare of S.L.J., 263 N.W.2d 412 (Minn.1978), the modifying
phrase &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot;
limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to
&quot;fighting words,&quot; i.e., &quot;conduct that itself inflicts
injury or tends to incite immediate violence ...,&quot; In re
Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn.1991) (citing Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 (1942)), and therefore the ordinance reached only expression
&quot;that the first amendment does not protect.&quot; 464 N.W.2d,
at 511. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because, in its view, &quot;the ordinance is a narrowly
tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental
interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated *2542
threats to public safety and order.&quot; Ibid. We granted certiorari,
501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2795, 115 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991).
<P>

<P>
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction
given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 339, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2975-2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.
747, 769, n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113
(1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895-896,
93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme
Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only
those expressions that constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; within
the meaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N.W.2d, at 510-511. Petitioner
and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation,
thereby invalidating the ordinance as &quot;substantially overbroad,&quot;
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-2915,
37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). We find it unnecessary to consider this
issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expression reached
by the ordinance is proscribable under the &quot;fighting words&quot;
doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech
solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses. (FN3)
<P>
The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
speech, see, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-311,
60 S.Ct. 900, 905-906, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), or even expressive
conduct, see, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), because of disapproval of
the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively
invalid. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, ---- -
----, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- - ---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Consolidated
Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 530,
536, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2332-2333, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289-2290,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). From 1791 to the present, however, our
society, like other free but civilized *2543 societies, has permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,
which are &quot;of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 762. We have recognized that
&quot;the freedom of speech&quot; referred to by the First Amendment
does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.
See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304,
1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343
U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952) (defamation); Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, supra, (&quot;fighting words&quot;); see generally
Simon &amp; Schuster, supra, 502 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Our decisions since
the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the traditional categorical
exceptions for defamation, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974);
see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 13-17,
110 S.Ct. 2695, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), and for obscenity,
see Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973), but a limited categorical approach has remained an
important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are
&quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308; Beauharnais,
supra, 343 U.S., at 266, 72 S.Ct., at 735; Chaplinsky, supra,
315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; or that the &quot;protection
of the First Amendment does not extend&quot; to them, Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 504,
104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); Sable Communications
of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835,
106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context,
however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally
repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity &quot;as not being
speech at all,&quot; Sunstein, Pornography and the First Amendment,
1986 Duke L.J. 589, 615, n. 146. What they mean is that these
areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be
regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content
(obscenity, defamation, etc.)--not that they are categories of
speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may
be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their
distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe
libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination
of proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently
acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U.S., at 763, 102
S.Ct., at 3357-3358, where, in upholding New York's child pornography
law, we expressly recognized that there was no &quot;question
here of censoring a particular literary theme....&quot; See also
id., at 775, 102 S.Ct., at 3364 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;As
drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication
of particular ideas&quot;).
<P>
Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First
Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regulation of particular
instances of such proscribable expression, so that the government
&quot;may regulate [them] freely,&quot; post, at 2552 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council
could enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene
works that contain criticism of the city government or, indeed,
that do not include endorsement of the city government. Such a
simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment
protection is at odds with common sense and with our jurisprudence
as well. (FN4) It is not true *2544 that &quot;fighting words&quot;
have at most a &quot;de minimis &quot; expressive content, ibid.,
or that their content is in all respects &quot;worthless and undeserving
of constitutional protection,&quot; post, at 2553; sometimes they
are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute
&quot;no part of the expression of ideas,&quot; but only that
they constitute &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas.&quot;
Chaplinsky, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769 (emphasis added).
<P>
The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable
on the basis of one feature (e.g., obscenity) but not on the basis
of another (e.g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace,
and has found application in many contexts. We have long held,
for example, that nonverbal expressive activity can be banned
because of the action it entails, but not because of the ideas
it expresses--so that burning a flag in violation of an ordinance
against outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag
in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.
See Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406-407, 109 S.Ct., at 2540-2541. See
also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct. 2456, 2460-2461, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (plurality);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.
367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
Similarly, we have upheld reasonable &quot;time, place, or manner&quot;
restrictions, but only if they are &quot;justified without reference
to the content of the regulated speech.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753-2754, 105 L.Ed.2d
661 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298, 104
S.Ct. 3065, 3071, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien
test differs little from the standard applied to time, place,
or manner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe particular
speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e.g., noise) does
not entail the power to proscribe the same speech on the basis
of a content element; so also, the power to proscribe it on the
basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity) does not entail
the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.
<P>
*2545 In other words, the exclusion of &quot;fighting words&quot;
from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for purposes
of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are,
despite their verbal character, essentially a &quot;nonspeech&quot;
element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to
a noisy sound truck: Each is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized,
a &quot;mode of speech,&quot; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268,
282, 71 S.Ct. 325, 333, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result); both can be used to convey an idea; but
neither has, in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment.
As with the sound truck, however, so also with fighting words:
The government may not regulate use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards
the underlying message expressed. Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (upholding, against
facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targeted residential
picketing) with Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980) (invalidating a ban on residential picketing
that exempted labor picketing). (FN5)
<P>
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new First Amendment
principle that prohibition of constitutionally proscribable speech
cannot be &quot;underinclusiv[e],&quot; post, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment &quot;absolutism&quot;
whereby &quot;within a particular 'proscribable' category of expression,
... a government must either proscribe all speech or no speech
at all,&quot; post, at 2562 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
That easy target is of the concurrences' own invention. In our
view, the First Amendment imposes not an &quot;underinclusiveness&quot;
limitation but a &quot;content discrimination&quot; limitation
upon a State's prohibition of proscribable speech. There is no
problem whatever, for example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity
(and other forms of proscribable expression) only in certain media
or markets, for although that prohibition would be &quot;underinclusive,&quot;
it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See, e.g.,
Sable Communications, 492 U.S., at 124-126, 109 S.Ct., at 2835-2836
(upholding 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(b)(1) (1988), which prohibits obscene
telephone communications).
<P>
Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert
the First Amendment requires is not absolute. It applies differently
in the context of proscribable speech than in the area of fully
protected speech. The rationale of the general prohibition, after
all, is that content discrimination &quot;rais[es] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints
from the marketplace,&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at
----, 112 S.Ct., at 508; Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. ----, ----,
111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991); FCC v. League of
Women Voters of California, 468 U.S. 364, 383-384, 104 S.Ct. 3106,
3119-3120, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co., 447
U.S., at 536, 100 S.Ct., at 2333; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,
408 U.S., at 95-98, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292. But content discrimination
among various instances of a class of proscribable speech often
does not pose this threat.
<P>
When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely
of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable,
no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.
Such a reason, having been adjudged neutral enough to support
exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection,
is also neutral enough to form the *2546 basis of distinction
within the class. To illustrate: A State might choose to prohibit
only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its
prurience--i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays
of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only
that obscenity which includes offensive political messages. See
Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F.2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert. denied,
498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991). And the
Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence
that are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707,
89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (upholding the facial
validity of Sec. 871 because of the &quot;overwhelmin[g] interest
in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing
him to perform his duties without interference from threats of
physical violence&quot;). But the Federal Government may not criminalize
only those threats against the President that mention his policy
on aid to inner cities. And to take a final example (one mentioned
by Justice STEVENS, post, at 2563-2564), a State may choose to
regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others,
because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of commercial
speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection,
see Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771-772, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830-1831, 48 L.Ed.2d
346 (1976)) is in its view greater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d
157 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising); Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d
444 (1978) (state regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State
may not prohibit only that commercial advertising that depicts
men in a demeaning fashion, see, e.g., L.A. Times, Aug. 8, 1989,
section 4, p. 6, col. 1.
<P>
Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even
a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the
subclass happens to be associated with particular &quot;secondary
effects&quot; of the speech, so that the regulation is &quot;justified
without reference to the content of the ... speech,&quot; Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 48, 106 S.Ct. 925, 929,
89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986) (quoting, with emphasis, Virginia Pharmacy
Bd., supra, 425 U.S., at 771, 96 S.Ct., at 1830); see also Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 71, n. 34, 96 S.Ct.
2440, 2453, n. 34, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); id., at
80-82, 96 S.Ct., at 2457-2458 (Powell, J., concurring);
<P>
Barnes, 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2469-2471 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit
all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover,
since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not
against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for
example, is violated by telling the enemy the nation's defense
secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable
class of speech can be swept up incidentally within the reach
of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech. See id.,
at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2460 (plurality); id., at ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER, J., concurring
in judgment); FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U.S.
411, 425-432, 110 S.Ct. 768, 776-780, 107 L.Ed.2d 851 (1990);
O'Brien, 391 U.S., at 376-377, 88 S.Ct., at 1678-1679. Thus, for
example, sexually derogatory &quot;fighting words,&quot; among
other words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition
against sexual discrimination in employment practices, 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2; 29 CFR Sec. 1604.11 (1991). See also 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242; 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1982. Where the government does not
target conduct on the *2547 basis of its expressive content, acts
are not shielded from regulation merely because they express a
discriminatory idea or philosophy.
<P>
These bases for distinction refute the proposition that the selectivity
of the restriction is &quot;even arguably 'conditioned upon the
sovereign's agreement with what a speaker may intend to say.'
&quot; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 555, 101 S.Ct.
2882, 2917, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
part) (citation omitted). There may be other such bases as well.
Indeed, to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribable
speech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identify any
particular &quot;neutral&quot; basis, so long as the nature of
the content discrimination is such that there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannot
think of any First Amendment interest that would stand in the
way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motion pictures
with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation, the regulation
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; like the regulation of noisy speech,
may address some offensive instances and leave other, equally
offensive, instances alone. See Posadas de Puerto Rico, 478 U.S.,
at 342-343, 106 S.Ct., at 2977-2978. (FN6)
<P>
II
<P>
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude
that, even as narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court,
the ordinance is facially unconstitutional. Although the phrase
in the ordinance, &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others,&quot; has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's
construction to reach only those symbols or displays that amount
to &quot;fighting words,&quot; the remaining, unmodified terms
make clear that the ordinance applies only to &quot;fighting words&quot;
that insult, or provoke violence, &quot;on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; Displays containing abusive
invective, no matter how vicious or severe, are permissible unless
they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics.
Those who wish to use &quot;fighting words&quot; in connection
with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis
of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality--are
not covered. The First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose
special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects. See Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at ---- - ----,
112 S.Ct., at ---- - ----; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 229-230, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
<P>
In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even
beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.
Displays containing some words--odious racial epithets, for example--would
be prohibited to proponents of all views. But &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or
*2548 gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--would
seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing
in favor of racial, color, etc. tolerance and equality, but could
not be used by that speaker's opponents. One could hold up a sign
saying, for example, that all &quot;anti-Catholic bigots&quot;
are misbegotten; but not that all &quot;papists&quot; are, for
that would insult and provoke violence &quot;on the basis of religion.&quot;
St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate
to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis
of Queensbury Rules.
<P>
What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
(which would be facially valid if it met the requirements of the
Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a prohibition of fighting
words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court repeatedly
emphasized) messages of &quot;bias-motivated&quot; hatred and
in particular, as applied to this case, messages &quot;based on
virulent notions of racial supremacy.&quot; 464 N.W.2d, at 508,
511. One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme
Court that &quot;[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation,
of diverse communities to confront such notions in whatever form
they appear,&quot; ibid., but the manner of that confrontation
cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech. St. Paul's
brief asserts that a general &quot;fighting words&quot; law would
not meet the city's needs because only a content-specific measure
can communicate to minority groups that the &quot;group hatred&quot;
aspect of such speech &quot;is not condoned by the majority.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that
majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its content.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul
acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group
hatred, Justice STEVENS suggests that this &quot;fundamentally
misreads&quot; the ordinance. Post, at 2570. It is directed, he
claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular
&quot;injur[ies]&quot; that are &quot;qualitatively different&quot;
from other injuries. Post, at 2565. This is word-play. What makes
the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc. produced by violation
of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor,
etc. produced by other fighting words is nothing other than the
fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive
message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It
is obvious that the symbols which will arouse &quot;anger, alarm
or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion
or gender&quot; are those symbols that communicate a message of
hostility based on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes
in its brief that the ordinance applies only to &quot;racial,
religious, or gender-specific symbols&quot; such as &quot;a burning
cross, Nazi swastika or other instrumentality of like import.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile
Court that &quot;[t]he burning of a cross does express a message
and it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.
Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate.&quot; Memorandum from the
Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A. Flinn, Jr.,
dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R.A.V., No. 89-D-1231
(Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted in App. to Brief for
Petitioner C-1.
<P>
The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paul ordinance
comes within neither any of the specific exceptions to the First
Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier, nor within a more
general exception for content discrimination that does not threaten
censorship of ideas. It assuredly does not fall within the exception
for content discrimination based on the very reasons why the particular
class of speech at issue (here, fighting words) is proscribable.
As explained earlier, see supra, at 2545, the reason why fighting
words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First
Amendment is not that their content communicates *2549 any particular
idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable
(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the
speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled out an especially
offensive mode of expression--it has not, for example, selected
for prohibition only those fighting words that communicate ideas
in a threatening (as opposed to a merely obnoxious) manner. Rather,
it has proscribed fighting words of whatever manner that communicate
messages of racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity
of this sort creates the possibility that the city is seeking
to handicap the expression of particular ideas. That possibility
would alone be enough to render the ordinance presumptively invalid,
but St. Paul's comments and concessions in this case elevate the
possibility to a certainty.
<P>
St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another of the
specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allows content
discrimination aimed only at the &quot;secondary effects&quot;
of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.
41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). According to St. Paul,
the ordinance is intended, &quot;not to impact on [sic ] the right
of free expression of the accused,&quot; but rather to &quot;protect
against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly
vulnerable because of their membership in a group that historically
has been discriminated against.&quot; Brief for Respondent 28.
Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes, rather
than merely regulates, a specified category of speech can ever
be considered to be directed only to the secondary effects of
such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinance is not directed
to secondary effects within the meaning of Renton. As we said
in Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
<P>
1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), &quot;[l]isteners' reactions to speech
are not the type of 'secondary effects' we referred to in Renton.&quot;
Id., at 321, 108 S.Ct., at 1163-1164. &quot;The emotive impact
of speech on its audience is not a 'secondary effect.' &quot;
Ibid. See also id., at 334, 108 S.Ct., at 1170-1171. (opinion
of Brennan, J.). (FN7)
<P>
It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fall within
some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for
any reason is beyond the suspicion of official suppression of
ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this very case afford ample
basis for, if not full confirmation of, that suspicion.
<P>
Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota
Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance regulates expression
based on hostility towards its protected ideological content,
this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests. Specifically, they
assert that the ordinance helps to ensure the basic human rights
of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live
in peace where they wish. We do not doubt that these interests
are compelling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote
them. But the &quot;danger of censorship&quot; presented by a
facially content-based statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S.
----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991), requires
that that weapon be employed only where it is &quot;necessary
to serve the asserted [compelling] interest,&quot; Burson v. Freeman,
504 *2550 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5
(1992) (plurality) (emphasis added); Perry Education Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948,
954-955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral
alternatives thus &quot;undercut[s] significantly&quot; any defense
of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, 485 U.S., at 329, 108
S.Ct., at 1168, casting considerable doubt on the government's
protestations that &quot;the asserted justification is in fact
an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law,&quot;
Burson, supra, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1859 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring). See Boos, supra, 485 U.S., at 324-329, 108 S.Ct.,
at 1165-1168; cf. Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota
Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 586-587, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1372-1373,
75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983). The dispositive question in this case,
therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary
to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not.
An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for example, would
have precisely the same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest
distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displaying
the city council's special hostility towards the particular biases
thus singled out. (FN8) That is precisely what the First Amendment
forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled to express that
hostility--but not through the means of imposing unique limitations
upon speakers who (however benightedly) disagree.
<P>
* * *
<P>
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross
in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient
means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding
the First Amendment to the fire.
<P>
The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice O'CONNOR
join, and with whom Justice STEVENS joins except as to Part I(A),
concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme
Court should be reversed. However, our agreement ends there.
<P>
This case could easily be decided within the contours of established
First Amendment law by holding, as petitioner argues, that the
St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes
not only unprotected expression but expression protected by the
First Amendment. See Part II, infra. Instead, &quot;find[ing]
it unnecessary&quot; to consider the questions upon which we granted
review, (FN1) ante, at 2542, the *2551 Court holds the ordinance
facially unconstitutional on a ground that was never presented
to the Minnesota Supreme Court, a ground that has not been briefed
by the parties before this Court, a ground that requires serious
departures from the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent
with the plurality opinion in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992), which was joined by two
of the five Justices in the majority in the present case.
<P>
This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its precedents.
Twice within the past month, the Court has declined to overturn
longstanding but controversial decisions on questions of constitutional
law. See Allied Signal, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation,
504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2251, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992); Quill
Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d
91 (1992). In each case, we had the benefit of full briefing on
the critical issue, so that the parties and amici had the opportunity
to apprise us of the impact of a change in the law. And in each
case, the Court declined to abandon its precedents, invoking the
principle of stare decisis. Allied Signal, Inc., supra, --- U.S.,
at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261;
<P>
Quill Corp., supra, --- U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1915-1916.
<P>
But in the present case, the majority casts aside long-established
First Amendment doctrine without the benefit of briefing and adopts
an untried theory. This is hardly a judicious way of proceeding,
and the Court's reasoning in reaching its result is transparently
wrong.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression falling
within certain limited categories so lacks the values the First
Amendment was designed to protect that the Constitution affords
no protection to that expression. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), made the point
in the clearest possible terms:
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise
<P>
any Constitutional problem.... It has been well observed that
such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be *2552 derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Id., at 571-572,
62 S.Ct., at 769.
<P>
See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
466 U.S. 485, 504, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984)
(citing Chaplinsky ).
<P>
Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 2543, this Court
has long held certain discrete categories of expression to be
proscribable on the basis of their content. For instance, the
Court has held that the individual who falsely shouts &quot;fire&quot;
in a crowded theatre may not claim the protection of the First
Amendment. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct.
247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919). The Court has concluded that neither
child pornography, nor obscenity, is protected by the First Amendment.
New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73
L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 20, 93
S.Ct. 2607, 2612, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Roth v. United States,
354 U.S. 476, 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308-1309, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957). And the Court has observed that, &quot;[l]eaving aside
the special considerations when public officials [and public figures]
are the target, a libelous publication is not protected by the
Constitution.&quot; Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763, 102 S.Ct.,
at 3358 (citations omitted).
<P>
All of these categories are content based. But the Court has held
that First mendment does not apply to them because their expressive
content is worthless or of de minimis value to society. Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769. We have not
departed from this principle, emphasizing repeatedly that, &quot;within
the confines of [these] given classification[s], the evil to be
restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,
if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication
is required.&quot;
<P>
Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2231, 44
L.Ed.2d 600 (1975). This categorical approach has provided a principled
and narrowly focused means for distinguishing between expression
that the government may regulate freely and that which it may
regulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of compelling
need. (FN2)
<P>
Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courts did not
mean their repeated statements that certain categories of expression
are &quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308. See ante, at
2543, citing Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct.
725, 735, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952); Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S., at
571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; Bose Corp., supra, 466 U.S., at
504, 104 S.Ct., at 1961; Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.
FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835, 106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989).
The present Court submits that such clear statements &quot;must
be taken in context&quot; and are not &quot;literally true.&quot;
Ante, at 2543.
<P>
To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what they said:
The categorical approach is a firmly entrenched part of our First
Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Court in Roth reviewed the
guarantees of freedom of expression in effect at the time of the
ratification of the Constitution and concluded, &quot;[i]n light
of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing
of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.&quot;
354 U.S., at 482-483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308.
<P>
In its decision today, the Court points to &quot;[n]othing ...
in this Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this longstanding
tradition.&quot; Burson, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1860
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Allied Signal, Inc., supra,
*2553 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261. Nevertheless, the majority
holds that the First Amendment protects those narrow categories
of expression long held to be undeserving of First Amendment protection--at
least to the extent that lawmakers may not regulate some fighting
words more strictly than others because of their content. The
Court announces that such content-based distinctions violate the
First Amendment because &quot;the government may not regulate
use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying
message expressed.&quot; Ante, at 2545. Should the government
want to criminalize certain fighting words, the Court now requires
it to criminalize all fighting words.
<P>
To borrow a phrase, &quot;Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all
approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with common
sense and with our jurisprudence as well.&quot; Ante, at 2543.
It is inconsistent to hold that the government may proscribe an
entire category of speech because the content of that speech is
evil, Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
but that the government may not treat a subset of that category
differently without violating the First Amendment; the content
of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of constitutional
protection.
<P>
The majority's observation that fighting words are &quot;quite
expressive indeed,&quot; ante, at 2544, is no answer. Fighting
words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying supporters,
or registering a protest; they are directed against individuals
to provoke violence or to inflict injury. Chaplinsky, 315 U.S.,
at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Therefore, a ban on all fighting words
or on a subset of the fighting words category would restrict only
the social evil of hate speech, without creating the danger of
driving viewpoints from the marketplace. See ante, at 2545.
<P>
Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand of First
Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me. (FN3) The overbreadth
doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chilling
of protected expression, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,
612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); Osborne v. Ohio,
495 U.S. 103, 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, n. 8, 109 L.Ed.2d
98 (1990); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503,
105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985); Ferber, supra, 458
U.S., at 772, 102 S.Ct., at 3362, but the Court's new &quot;underbreadth&quot;
creation serves no desirable function. Instead, it permits, indeed
invites, the continuation of expressive conduct that in this case
is evil and worthless in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra,
at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359; Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S.,
at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769, until the city of St. Paul cures
the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catch-all phrase
such as &quot;and all other fighting words that may constitutionally
be subject to this ordinance.&quot;
<P>
Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence
is surely a negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions
of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred
conveyed by burning a cross on someone's lawn, are of sufficient
value to outweigh the social interest in order and morality that
has traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First
Amendment. (FN4) Indeed, by characterizing fighting words as a
form of &quot;debate,&quot; ante, at 2548, the majority *2554
legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion.
<P>
Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speech that could
be regulated freely on the basis of content (i.e., the narrow
categories of expression falling outside the First Amendment)
and that which could be regulated on the basis of content only
upon a showing of a compelling state interest (i.e., all remaining
expression). By placing fighting words, which the Court has long
held to be valueless, on at least equal constitutional footing
with political discourse and other forms of speech that we have
deemed to have the greatest social value, the majority devalues
the latter category. See Burson v. Freeman, supra, --- at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1849-1850; Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 222-223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019-1020,
103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).
<P>
B
<P>
In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses to sustain
the ordinance even though it would survive under the strict scrutiny
applicable to other protected expression. Assuming, arguendo,
that the St. Paul ordinance is a content-based regulation of protected
expression, it nevertheless would pass First Amendment review
under settled law upon a showing that the regulation &quot; 'is
necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly
drawn to achieve that end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.
v. New York Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct.
501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project,
Inc., v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). St. Paul has urged that its ordinance, in
the words of the majority, &quot;helps to ensure the basic human
rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination....&quot; Ante, at ----. The Court expressly
concedes that this interest is compelling and is promoted by the
ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strict scrutiny
analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality of the legislation:
<P>
&quot;The dispositive question ... is whether content discrimination
is reasonably necessary in order to achieve St. Paul's compelling
interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the
favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.&quot;
Ibid.
<P>
Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-based ordinance
could never pass constitutional muster if the object of that legislation
could be accomplished by banning a wider category of speech. This
appears to be a general renunciation of strict scrutiny review,
a fundamental tool of First Amendment analysis. (FN5)
<P>
This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in light of our
decision in Burson v. Freeman, supra, which was handed down just
a month ago. (FN6) In Burson, seven *2555 of the eight participating
members of the Court agreed that the strict scrutiny standard
applied in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a content-based
statute. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1851; id., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 1848 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). (FN7) The statute at
issue prohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or
distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance
to a polling place. The plurality concluded that the legislation
survived strict scrutiny because the State had asserted a compelling
interest in regulating electioneering near polling places and
because the statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish
that goal. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856-1857.
<P>
Significantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all speech
near polling places; it restricted only political speech. Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1850. The Burson plurality, which included
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the distinction
between types of speech required application of strict scrutiny,
but it squarely rejected the proposition that the legislation
failed First Amendment review because it could have been drafted
in broader, content-neutral terms:
<P>
&quot;States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them.
<P>
The First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems
that do not exist.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856 (emphasis
added).
<P>
This reasoning is in direct conflict with the majority's analysis
in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmakers attempting
to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enact a sweeping prohibition
on an entire class of speech (thereby requiring &quot;regulat[ion]
for problems that do not exist); or (2) not legislate at all.
<P>
Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the present case been
applied in Burson, the challenged election law would have failed
constitutional review, for its content-based distinction between
political and nonpolitical speech could not have been characterized
as &quot;reasonably necessary,&quot; ante, at 2550, to achieve
the State's interest in regulating polling place premises. (FN8)
<P>
As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the
majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our firmly established
strict scrutiny analysis at this time. The majority appears to
believe that its doctrinal revisionism is necessary to prevent
our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against members of
one political party but not another and from enacting similarly
preposterous laws. Ante, at 2543. The majority is misguided.
<P>
Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected
speech, such as fighting words, the Equal Protection Clause requires
that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related
to a legitimate government interest. A defamation statute that
drew distinctions on the basis of political affiliation or &quot;an
ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain
criticism of the *2556 city government,&quot; ante, at 2543, would
unquestionably fail rational basis review. (FN9)
<P>
Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming arguendo, as the
majority does, that the ordinance is not constitutionally overbroad
(but see Part II, infra ), there is no question that it would
pass equal protection review. The ordinance proscribes a subset
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; those that injure &quot;on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; This selective
regulation reflects the City's judgment that harms based on race,
color, creed, religion, or gender are more pressing public concerns
than the harms caused by other fighting words. In light of our
Nation's long and painful experience with discrimination, this
determination is plainly reasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes,
the interest is compelling. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
C
<P>
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive
list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be viewed either as an
attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of
this case, see post, at 2560-2561 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in
judgment), or as an effort to anticipate some of the questions
that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law.
<P>
For instance, if the majority were to give general application
to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decision would
call into question the
<P>
constitutionality of the statute making it illegal to threaten
the life of the President. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871. See Watts v. United
States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per
curiam ). Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats,
incorporates a content-based distinction; it indicates that the
Government especially disfavors threats against the President
as opposed to threats against all others. (FN10) See ante, at
2547. But because the Government could prohibit all threats and
not just those directed against the President, under the Court's
theory, the compelling reasons justifying the enactment of special
legislation to safeguard the President would be irrelevant, and
the statute would fail First Amendment review.
<P>
To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the following
exception onto its newly announced First Amendment rule: Content-based
distinctions may be drawn within an unprotected category of speech
if the basis for the distinctions is &quot;the very reason the
entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot; Ante, at
2545. Thus, the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to
threaten the life of the President is constitutional, &quot;since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President.&quot; Ante, at 2546.
<P>
The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should
apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since &quot;the reasons why [fighting
words] are outside the First Amendment ... have special force
when applied to [groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination].&quot;
<P>
To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that
fighting words are *2557 simply a mode of communication, rather
than a content-based category, and that the St. Paul ordinance
has not singled out a particularly objectionable mode of communication.
Ante, at 2545, 2548. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A
prohibition on fighting words is not a time, place, or manner
restriction; it is a ban on a class of speech that conveys an
overriding message of personal injury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769, a message that is at
its ugliest when directed against groups that have long been the
targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance falls within
the first exception to the majority's theory.
<P>
As its second exception, the Court posits that certain content-based
regulations will survive under the new regime if the regulated
subclass &quot;happens to be associated with particular 'secondary
effects' of the speech ...,&quot; ante, at 2546, which the majority
treats as encompassing instances in which &quot;words can ...
violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct ...&quot;
Ante, at 2546. (FN11) Again, there is a simple explanation for
the Court's eagerness to craft an exception to its new First Amendment
rule:
<P>
Under the general rule the Court applies in this case, Title VII
hostile work environment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional.
<P>
Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate &quot;because of [an]
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&quot;
42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1), and the regulations covering hostile
workplace claims forbid &quot;sexual harassment,&quot; which includes
&quot;[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature&quot;
which creates &quot;an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.&quot; 29 CFR Sec.
<P>
1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit workplace
harassment generally; it focuses on what the majority would characterize
as the &quot;disfavored topi[c]&quot; of sexual harassment. Ante,
at 2547. In this way, Title VII is similar to the St. Paul ordinance
that the majority condemns because it &quot;impose[s] special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects.&quot; Ibid. Under the broad principle the Court uses
to decide the present case, hostile work environment claims based
on sexual harassment should fail First Amendment review; because
a general ban on harassment in the workplace would cover the problem
of sexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategory
of sexually harassing expression would violate the First Amendment.
<P>
Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court indicates
would insulate a Title VII hostile work environment claim from
an underinclusiveness challenge because &quot;sexually derogatory
'fighting words' ... may produce a violation of Title VII's general
prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices.&quot;
Ante, at 2546. But application of this exception to a hostile
work environment claim does not hold up under close examination.
<P>
First, the hostile work environment regulation is not keyed to
the presence or absence of an economic quid pro quo, Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d
49 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimized worker.
Consequently, the regulation would no more fall within a secondary
effects exception than does the St. Paul ordinance. Ante, at 2549.
Second, the majority's focus on the statute's general prohibition
on discrimination glosses over the language of the specific regulation
governing hostile working environment, which reaches beyond any
&quot;incidental&quot; effect on speech. United States v. O'Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
If the relationship between *2558 the broader statute and specific
regulation is sufficient to bring the Title VII regulation within
O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to bring its ordinance within
this exception is to add some prefatory language concerning discrimination
generally.
<P>
As the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding this
case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to protect against
unforeseen problems, a concern that is heightened here given the
lack of briefing on the majority's decisional theory. This final
exception would apply in cases in which &quot;there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&quot;
Ante, at 2547. As I have demonstrated, this case does not concern
the official suppression of ideas. See supra, at 2553. The majority
discards this notion out-of-hand. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do nothing
more than confuse the law. Its selection of this case to rewrite
First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable, because the
whole problem could have been avoided by deciding this case under
settled First Amendment principles.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with
its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However,
I would decide the case on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doctrine is
an exception to the established principle that &quot;a person
to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be
heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably
be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not
before the Court.&quot; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S., at 610,
93 S.Ct., at 2915; Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S.,
at 503-504, 105 S.Ct., at 2801-2802. A defendant being prosecuted
for speech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on its
face if it reaches protected expression, even when that person's
activities are not protected by the First Amendment. This is because
&quot;the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected
speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that

<P>
However, we have consistently held that, because overbreadth analysis
is &quot;strong medicine,&quot; it may be invoked to strike an
entire statute only when the overbreadth of the statute is not
only &quot;real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,&quot; Broadrick, 413 U.S.,
at 615, 93 S.Ct., at 2917, and when the statute is not susceptible
to limitation or partial invalidation. Id., at 613, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2916; Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 574, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 2571, 96 L.Ed.2d 500
(1987). &quot;When a federal court is dealing with a federal statute
challenged as overbroad, it should ... construe the statute to
avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to a
limiting construction.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S., at 769, n. 24,
102 S.Ct., at 3361, n. 24. Of course, &quot;[a] state court is
also free to deal with a state statute in the same way.&quot;
Ibid. See, e.g., Osborne, 495 U.S. at 113-114, 110 S.Ct., at 1698-1699.
<P>
Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not susceptible
to a narrowing construction and that the ordinance therefore should
be considered as written, and not as construed by the Minnesota
Supreme Court. Petitioner is wrong. Where a state court has interpreted
a provision of state law, we cannot ignore that interpretation,
*2559 even if it is not one that we would have reached if we were
construing the statute in the first instance. Ibid.;
<P>
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1856, 75
L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,
Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, n. 5, 71
L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). (FN12)
<P>
Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpretation does
not insulate a statute from overbreadth review. We have stricken
legislation when the construction supplied by the state court
failed to cure the overbreadth problem. See, e.g., Lewis v. City
of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 132-133, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972, 39 L.Ed.2d
214 (1974); Gooding, supra, 405 U.S., at 524-525, 92 S.Ct., at
1107-1108. But in such cases, we have looked to the statute as
construed in determining whether it contravened the First Amendment.
Here, the Minnesota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative
construction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Consideration
of petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on that interpretation.
<P>
I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face.
Although the ordinance as construed reaches categories of speech
that are constitutionally unprotected, it also criminalizes a
substantial amount of expression that--however repugnant--is shielded
by the First Amendment.
<P>
In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias ordinance,
the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two of the categories
of speech and expressive conduct that fall outside the First Amendment's
protective sphere: words that incite &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot;
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1830, 23
L.Ed.2d 430 (1969), and &quot;fighting&quot; words, Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769.
The Minnesota Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky
fighting words test and consequently interpreted the St. Paul
ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinance facially overbroad.
<P>
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court
drew upon the definition of fighting words that appears in Chaplinsky--words
&quot;which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Id., at 572, 62
S.Ct., at 769. However, the Minnesota court was far from clear
in identifying the &quot;injur[ies]&quot; inflicted by the expression
that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, the Minnesota court
emphasized (tracking the language of the ordinance) that &quot;the
ordinance censors only those displays that one knows or should
know will create anger, alarm or resentment based on racial, ethnic,
gender or religious bias.&quot; In re Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d
507, 510 (1991). I therefore understand the court to have ruled
that St. Paul may constitutionally prohibit expression that &quot;by
its very utterance&quot; causes &quot;anger, alarm or resentment.&quot;
<P>
Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that such generalized
reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional
protection. The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt
feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression
unprotected. See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 319,
110 S.Ct. 2404, 2410, 110 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990); Texas v. Johnson,

<P>
In the First Amendment context, &quot;[c]riminal statutes must
be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawful
a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may
be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.&quot;
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d
398 (1987) (citation omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance
is such a law. Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is
unprotected, it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes
only hurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by
the First Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, 415 U.S., at 132, 94 S.Ct.,
at 972. (FN13) The ordinance is therefore fatally overbroad and
invalid on its face.
<P>
III
<P>
Today, the Court has disregarded two established principles of
First Amendment law without providing a coherent replacement theory.
Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire interpretation, driven by
the frequently irresistible impulse of judges to tinker with the
First Amendment. The decision is mischievous at best and will
surely confuse the lower courts. I join the judgment, but not
the folly of the opinion.
<P>
Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The majority opinion
signals one of two possibilities: it will serve as precedent for
future cases, or it will not. Either result is disheartening.
<P>
In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regulate
speech that causes great harm unless it also regulates speech
that does not (setting law and logic on their heads), the Court
seems to abandon the categorical approach, and inevitably to relax
the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As Justice
WHITE points out, this weakens the traditional protections of
speech. If all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection,
that protection will be scant. The simple reality is that the
Court will never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising
the level of protection customarily granted political speech.
If we are forbidden from categorizing, as the Court has done here,
we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that in
its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Court
is willing to weaken First Amendment protections.
<P>
In the second instance is the possibility that this case will
not significantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence, but, instead,
will be regarded as an aberration--a case where the Court manipulated
doctrine to strike down an ordinance whose premise it opposed,
namely, that racial threats and *2561 verbal assaults are of greater
harm than other fighting words. I fear that the Court has been
distracted from its proper mission by the temptation to decide
the issue over &quot;politically correct speech&quot; and &quot;cultural
diversity,&quot; neither of which is presented here. If this is
the meaning of today's opinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable.
<P>
I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law
that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities out of their homes
by burning crosses on their lawns, but I see great harm in preventing
the people of Saint Paul from specifically punishing the race-based
fighting words that so prejudice their community.
<P>
I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice
WHITE that this particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words
to speech protected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice BLACKMUN
join as to Part I, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms may
be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a fire near an ammunition
dump or a gasoline storage tank is especially dangerous; such
behavior may be punished more severely than burning trash in a
vacant lot. Threatening someone because of her race or religious
beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot,
and threatening a high public official may cause substantial social
disruption; such threats may be punished more severely than threats
against someone based on, say, his support of a particular athletic
team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutral justifications
for such special rules.
<P>
This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordinance.
Because the regulated conduct has some communicative content--a
message of racial, religious or gender hostility--the ordinance
raises two quite different First Amendment questions. Is the ordinance
&quot;overbroad&quot; because it prohibits too much speech? If
not, is it &quot;underbroad&quot; because it does not prohibit
enough speech?
<P>
In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle with
two broad principles: first, that certain &quot;categories of
expression [including 'fighting words'] are 'not within the area
of constitutionally protected speech,' &quot; ante, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment); and second, that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations [of expression] are presumptively invalid.&quot; Ante,
at 2542 (Opinion of the Court). Although in past opinions the
Court has repeated both of these maxims, it has--quite rightly--adhered
to neither with the absolutism suggested by my colleagues. Thus,
while I agree that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally
overbroad for the reasons stated in Part II of Justice WHITE's
opinion, I write separately to suggest how the allure of absolute
principles has skewed the analysis of both the majority and concurring
opinions.
<P>
I
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical approach
to First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem.... It has been well
observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition
of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86
L.Ed. 1031 (1942).
<P>
We have, as Justice WHITE observes, often described such categories
of expression as &quot;not within the area of constitutionally
protected speech.&quot; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483,
77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957).
<P>
*2562 The Court today revises this categorical approach. It is
not, the Court rules, that certain &quot;categories&quot; of expression
are &quot;unprotected,&quot; but rather that certain &quot;elements&quot;
of expression are wholly &quot;proscribable.&quot; To the Court,
an expressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more
than one element. Although the act may be regulated because it
contains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated on the
basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also contains. Thus,
obscene antigovernment speech may be regulated because it is obscene,
but not because it is antigovernment. Ante, at 2543. It is this
revision of the categorical approach that allows the Court to
assume that the St. Paul ordinance proscribes only fighting words,
while at the same time concluding that the ordinance is invalid
because it imposes a content-based regulation on expressive activity.
<P>
As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical
approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doctrinal
wonderland, for the concept of &quot;obscene anti-government&quot;
speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene is very narrow;
to be obscene, expression must be found by the trier of fact to
&quot;appea[l] to the prurient interest, ... depic[t] or describ[e],
in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct, [and] taken as a
whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.&quot; Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607,
2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (emphasis added). &quot;Obscene
antigovernment&quot; speech, then, is a contradiction in terms:
If expression is antigovernment, it does not &quot;lac[k] serious
... political ... value&quot; and cannot be obscene.
<P>
The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its novel
analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time, place, or
manner of expression or on expressive conduct. It is true that
loud speech in favor of the Republican Party can be regulated
because it is loud, but not because it is pro-Republican; and
it is true that the public burning of the American flag can be
regulated because it involves public burning and not because it
involves the flag. But these analogies are inapposite. In each
of these examples, the two elements (e.g., loudness and pro-Republican
orientation) can coexist; in the case of &quot;obscene antigovernment&quot;
speech, however, the presence of one element (&quot;obscenity&quot;)
by definition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it is
unwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on such highly
speculative hypotheticals.
<P>
I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's
analysis--namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is
an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Drawing
on broadly worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute
ban on content-based regulations of expression and holds that
the First Amendment prohibits the regulation of fighting words
by subject matter. Thus, while the Court rejects the &quot;all-or-nothing-at-all&quot;
nature of the categorical approach, ante, at 2543, it promptly
embraces an absolutism of its own: within a particular &quot;proscribable&quot;
category of expression, the Court holds, a government must either
proscribe all speech or no speech at all. (FN1) This aspect of
the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the role and constitutional
status of content-based regulations *2563 on speech, conflicts
with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence, and disrupts
well-settled principles of First Amendment law.
<P>
Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that content-based
regulations of speech are &quot;never permitted,&quot; Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2292,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), such claims are overstated. Indeed, in
Mosley itself, the Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription
of nonlabor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather
could be upheld if the City demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
Id., at 100, 92 S.Ct., at 2292. Contrary to the broad dicta in
Mosley and elsewhere, our decisions demonstrate that content-based
distinctions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable
and indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of the First
Amendment.
<P>
This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In broadest
terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudence creates a regime
based on the content of speech. The scope of the First Amendment
is determined by the content of expressive activity: Although
the First Amendment broadly protects &quot;speech,&quot; it does
not protect the right to &quot;fix prices, breach contracts, make
false warranties, place bets with bookies, threaten, [or] extort.&quot;
Schauer, Categories and the First Amendment: A Play in Three Acts,
34 Vand.L.Rev. 265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitors
is a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine (FN2) hinges upon the content of
the agreement. Similarly, &quot;the line between permissible advocacy
and impermissible incitation to crime or violence depends, not
merely on the setting in which the speech occurs, but also on
exactly what the speaker had to say.&quot; Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 66, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2450, 49 L.Ed.2d
310 (1976) (plurality opinion); see also Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S.
95, 100-103, 68 S.Ct. 397, 399-401, 92 L.Ed. 562 (1948) (Rutledge,
J., dissenting).
<P>
Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the categories of
&quot;unprotected&quot; or &quot;proscribable&quot; expression
is determined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine is
obscene, a gesture a fighting word, or a photograph child pornography
is determined, in part, by its content. Even within categories
of protected expression, the First Amendment status of speech
is fixed by its content. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.
254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939,
86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), establish that the level of protection
given to speech depends upon its subject matter: speech about
public officials or matters of public concern receives greater
protection than speech about other topics. It can, therefore,
scarcely be said that the regulation of expressive activity cannot
be predicated on its content: much of our First Amendment jurisprudence
is premised on the assumption that content makes a difference.
<P>
Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently upheld
content-based regulations of speech. For example, in Young v.
American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zoning ordinances that
regulated movie theaters based on the content of the films shown.
In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57
L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restriction
on the broadcast of specific indecent words. In Lehman v. City
of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770
(1974) (plurality opinion), we upheld a city law that permitted
commercial advertising, but prohibited political advertising,
on city buses. In Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 *2564
S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), we upheld a state law that
restricted the speech of state employees, but only as concerned
partisan political matters. We have long recognized the power
of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate misleading advertising
and labeling, see, e.g., Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608,
66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946), and the National Labor Relations
Board's power to regulate an employer's election-related speech
on the basis of its content. See, e.g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing
Co., 395 U.S. 575, 616-618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942-1943, 23 L.Ed.2d
547 (1969). It is also beyond question that the Government may
choose to limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U.S.C. Secs.
1331-1340, (FN3) but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline
advertising, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), but not bus advertising;
or choose to monitor solicitation by lawyers, see Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978),
but not by doctors.
<P>
All of these cases involved the selective regulation of speech
based on content--precisely the sort of regulation the Court invalidates
today. Such selective regulations are unavoidably content based,
but they are not, in my opinion, &quot;presumptively invalid.&quot;
As these many decisions and examples demonstrate, the prohibition
on content-based regulations is not nearly as total as the Mosley
dictum suggests.
<P>
Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today goes
beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and applies the prohibition
on content-based regulation to speech that the Court had until
today considered wholly &quot;unprotected&quot; by the First Amendment--namely,
fighting words. This new absolutism in the prohibition of content-based
regulations severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amendment
law.
<P>
Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in
the constitutional protection of speech. Core political speech
occupies the highest, most protected position; commercial speech
and nonobscene, sexually explicit speech are regarded as a sort
of second-class expression; obscenity and fighting words receive
the least protection of all. Assuming that the Court is correct
that this last class of speech is not wholly &quot;unprotected,&quot;
it certainly does not follow that fighting words and obscenity
receive the same sort of protection afforded core political speech.
Yet in ruling that proscribable speech cannot be regulated based
on subject matter, the Court does just that. (FN4) Perversely,
this gives fighting words greater protection than is afforded
commercial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising
directed at airline passengers without also prohibiting false
advertising directed at bus passengers and if a city can prohibit
political advertisements in its buses while allowing other advertisements,
it is ironic to hold that a city cannot regulate fighting words
based on &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; while
leaving unregulated fighting words based on &quot;union membership
or homosexuality.&quot; Ante, at 2547. The Court today turns First
Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once entirely
unprotected (and that still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled
to greater protection than commercial speech--and possibly greater
protection than core political *2565 speech. See Burson v. Freeman,
504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, ----, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities, it quickly
offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly extended prohibition
on content-based regulations. First, the Court states that a content-based
regulation is valid &quot;[w]hen the content discrimination is
based upon the very reason the entire class of speech ... is proscribable.&quot;
In a pivotal passage, the Court writes &quot;the Federal Government
can criminalize only those physical threats that are directed
against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since the reasons
why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting
individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that
fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence
will occur) have special force when applied to the ... President.&quot;
Ante, at 2546.
<P>
As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose from
the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribe only
a subset (threats against the President) because those threats
are particularly likely to cause &quot;fear of violence,&quot;
&quot;disruption,&quot; and actual &quot;violence.&quot;
<P>
Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the conclusion
that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just as Congress
may determine that threats against the President entail more severe
consequences than other threats, so St. Paul's City Council may
determine that threats based on the target's race, religion, or
gender cause more severe harm to both the target and to society
than other threats. This latter judgment--that harms caused by
racial, religious, and gender-based invective are qualitatively
different from that caused by other fighting words--seems to me
eminently reasonable and realistic.
<P>
Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate advertising
in one industry but not another because &quot;the risk of fraud
(one of the characteristics that justifies depriving [commercial
speech] of full First Amendment protection ...)&quot; in the regulated
industry is &quot;greater&quot; than in other industries. Ante,
at 2546. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the constitutionality
of St. Paul's ordinance. &quot;[O]ne of the characteristics that
justifies&quot; the constitutional status of fighting words is
that such words &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury or
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Chaplinsky,
315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 762. Certainly a legislature that
may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal trade
than in the medical trade may determine that the risk of injury
or breach of peace created by race-based threats is greater than
that created by other threats.
<P>
Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis
of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that &quot;a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
... would be facially valid.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis deleted).
A selective proscription of unprotected expression designed to
protect &quot;certain persons or groups&quot; (for example, a
law proscribing threats directed at the elderly) would be constitutional
if it were based on a legitimate determination that the harm created
by the regulated expression differs from that created by the unregulated
expression (that is, if the elderly are more severely injured
by threats than are the nonelderly). Such selective protection
is no different from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors)
from obtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968). St. Paul has
determined--reasonably in my judgment--that fighting-word injuries
&quot;based on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; are
qualitatively different and more severe than fighting-word injuries
based on other characteristics. Whether the selective proscription
of proscribable speech is defined by the protected target (&quot;certain
persons or groups&quot;) or the basis of the harm (injuries &quot;based
on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot;) makes no constitutional
difference: what matters is whether *2566 the legislature's selection
is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonable distinction.
<P>
In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling--that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations are presumptively invalid&quot;--has simplistic appeal,
but lacks support in our First Amendment jurisprudence. To make
matters worse, the Court today extends this overstated claim to
reach categories of hitherto unprotected speech and, in doing
so, wreaks havoc in an area of settled law. Finally, although
the Court recognizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions
undermine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional.
Stated directly, the majority's position cannot withstand scrutiny.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I agree with much of Justice WHITE's analysis, I do not
join Part I-A of his opinion because I have reservations about
the &quot;categorical approach&quot; to the First Amendment. These
concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, see, e.g., New
York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 778, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3365-3366,
73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment),
lead me to find Justice WHITE's response to the Court's analysis
unsatisfying.
<P>
Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has
some appeal:
<P>
either expression is protected or it is not--the categories create
safe harbors for governments and speakers alike. But this approach
sacrifices subtlety for clarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately
unsound. As an initial matter, the concept of &quot;categories&quot;
fits poorly with the complex reality of expression. Few dividing
lines in First Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and
efforts at categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.
Our definitions of &quot;obscenity,&quot; see, e.g., Marks v.
United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198, 97 S.Ct. 990, 996, 51 L.Ed.2d
260 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part), and &quot;public forum,&quot; see, e.g., United States
Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S.
114, 126-131, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2683-2686, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981);
id., at 136-140, 101 S.Ct., at 2688-2691 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 147-151, 101 S.Ct., at 2694-2696 (Marshall,
J., dissenting); 152-154, 101 S.Ct. at 2696-2698 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (all debating the definition of &quot;public forum&quot;),
illustrate this all too well. The quest for doctrinal certainty
through the definition of categories and subcategories is, in
my opinion, destined to fail.
<P>
Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the
importance of context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy
of its regulation can only be determined in context. (FN5) Whether,
for example, a picture or a sentence is obscene cannot be judged
in the abstract, but rather only in the context of its setting,
its use, and its audience. Similarly, although legislatures may
freely regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography
that is part of &quot;a serious work of art, a documentary on
behavioral problems, or a medical or psychiatric teaching device,&quot;
may be entitled to constitutional protection; the &quot;question
whether a specific act of communication is protected by the First
Amendment always requires some consideration of both its content
and its context.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S. at 778, 102 S.Ct., at
3366 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); see also Smith v.
<P>
United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311-321, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1769-1774,
52 L.Ed.2d 324
<P>
(1977) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The categorical approach sweeps
too broadly when it declares that all such expression *2567 is
beyond the protection of the First Amendment.
<P>
Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing approach,
the Court has applied its analysis less categorically than its
doctrinal statements suggest.
<P>
The Court has recognized intermediate categories of speech (for
example, for indecent nonobscene speech and commercial speech)
and geographic categories of speech (public fora, limited public
fora, nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection.
The Court has also stringently delimited the categories of unprotected
speech. While we once declared that &quot;[l]ibelous utterances
[are] not ... within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct. 725, 735,
96 L.Ed. 919 (1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974),
and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472
U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), have substantially
qualified this broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed
the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception set forth in Chaplinsky
narrowly. See, e.g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct.
2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415
U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974); Cohen v. California,
403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In the case
of commercial speech, our ruling that &quot;the Constitution imposes
no ... restraint on government [regulation] as respects purely
commercial advertising,&quot; Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S.
52, 54, 62 S.Ct. 920, 921, 86 L.Ed. 1262 (1942), was expressly
repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976).
In short, the history of the categorical approach is largely the
history of narrowing the categories of unprotected speech.
<P>
This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical approach
is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of &quot;protected&quot;
and &quot;unprotected&quot; speech ultimately futile. My analysis
of the faults and limits of this approach persuades me that the
categorical approach presented in Part I-A of Justice WHITE's
opinion is not an adequate response to the novel &quot;underbreadth&quot;
analysis the Court sets forth today.
<P>
III
<P>
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and
part of Justice WHITE's analysis of the constitutionality St.
Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I do not believe that all content-based
regulations are equally infirm and presumptively invalid; unlike
Justice WHITE, I do not believe that fighting words are wholly
unprotected by the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe
our decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one
that considers the content and context of the regulated speech,
and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Applying
this analysis and assuming arguendo (as the Court does) that the
St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that such a selective,
subject-matter regulation on proscribable speech is constitutional.
<P>
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly
recognize that some content-based restrictions raise more constitutional
questions than others. Although the Court's analysis of content-based
regulations cannot be reduced to a simple formula, we have considered
a number of factors in determining the validity of such regulations.
<P>
First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided expressive
activity depends in part upon its content and character. We have
long recognized that when government regulates political speech
or &quot;the expression of editorial opinion on matters of public
importance,&quot; FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 375-376, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3114-3115, 82 L.Ed.2d 278
(1984), &quot;First Amendment protectio[n] is 'at its zenith.'
&quot; Meyer v. *2568 Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 425, 108 S.Ct. 1886,
1894, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recognized
that &quot;commercial speech receives a limited form of First
Amendment protection,&quot; Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 340, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986), and that &quot;society's interest
in protecting [sexually explicit films] is of a wholly different,
and lesser magnitude than [its] interest in untrammeled political
debate.&quot; Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at 70,
96 S.Ct., at 2452; see also FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). The character of expressive
 activity also weighs in our consideration of its constitutional
status. As we have frequently noted, &quot;[t]he government generally
has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has
in restricting the written or spoken word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989);
see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
The protection afforded expression turns as well on the context
of the regulated speech. We have noted, for example, that &quot;[a]ny
assessment of the precise scope of employer expression, of course,
must be made in the context of its labor relations setting ...
[and] must take into account the economic dependence of the employees
on their employers.&quot; NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S.,
at 617, 89 S.Ct., at 1942. Similarly, the distinctive character
of a university environment, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
277-280, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278-280, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environment,
see Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct.
592, 98 L.Ed.2d 562 (1988), influences our First Amendment analysis.
The same is true of the presence of a &quot; 'captive audience[,
one] there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' &quot; Lehman
v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S., at 302, 94 S.Ct., at 2717
(citation omitted). (FN6) Perhaps the most familiar embodiment
of the relevance of context is our &quot;fora&quot; jurisprudence,
differentiating the levels of protection afforded speech in different
locations.
<P>
The nature of a contested restriction of speech also informs our
evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for example, &quot;[a]ny
system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing
a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.&quot;
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631,
639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). More particularly to the matter of
content-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguished between
restrictions on expression based on subject matter and restrictions
based on viewpoint, indicating that the latter are particularly
pernicious. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at
414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544. &quot;Viewpoint discrimination is censorship
in its purest form,&quot; Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 62, 103 S.Ct. 948, 964, 74 L.Ed.2d
794 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular
scrutiny, in part because such regulation often indicates a legislative
effort to skew public debate on an issue. See, e.g., Schacht v.
United States, 398 U.S. 58, 63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559, 26 L.Ed.2d
44 (1970). &quot;Especially where ... the legislature's suppression
of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people,
the First Amendment is plainly offended.&quot; First National
Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407,
1420-1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). *2569 Thus, although a regulation
that on its face regulates speech by subject matter may in some
instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints, see, e.g.,
Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N.Y.,
447 U.S. 530, 546-547, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2338, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based
restrictions on expression require greater scrutiny than subject-matter
based restrictions. (FN7)
<P>
Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regulations
we have also looked more broadly at the scope of the restrictions.
For example, in Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
71, 96 S.Ct., at 2452-2453, we found significant the fact that
&quot;what [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than a
limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited.&quot;
Similarly, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the Court emphasized
two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling. First,
the ruling concerned only broadcast material which presents particular
problems because it &quot;confronts the citizen ... in the privacy
of the home&quot;; second, the ruling was not a complete ban on
the use of selected offensive words, but rather merely a limitation
on the times such speech could be broadcast. 438 U.S., at 748-750,
98 S.Ct., at 3039-3041.
<P>
All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of content-based
<P>
regulations on expression. Such a multi-faceted analysis cannot
be conflated into two dimensions. Whatever the allure of absolute
doctrines, it is just too simple to declare expression &quot;protected&quot;
or &quot;unprotected&quot; or to proclaim a regulation &quot;content-based&quot;
or &quot;content-neutral.&quot;
<P>
In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I assume
arguendo --as the Court does--that the ordinance regulates only
fighting words and therefore is not overbroad. Looking to the
content and character of the regulated activity, two things are
clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinance bars only low-value
speech, namely, fighting words. By definition such expression
constitutes &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and [is] of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be derived from [it] is clearly outweighed by
the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky, 315
U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Second, the ordinance regulates
&quot;expressive conduct [rather] than ... the written or spoken
word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406, 109 S.Ct., at
2540.
<P>
Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is again
significant that the statute (by hypothesis) regulates only fighting
words. Whether words are fighting words is determined in part
by their context. Fighting words are not words that merely cause
offense; fighting words must be directed at individuals so as
to &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury.&quot; By hypothesis,
then, the St. Paul ordinance restricts speech in confrontational
and potentially violent situations. The case at hand is illustrative.
The cross-burning in this case--directed as it was to a single
African-American family trapped in their home--was nothing more
than a crude form of physical intimidation. That this cross-burning
sends a message of racial hostility does not automatically endow
it with complete constitutional protection. (FN8) *2570 Significantly,
the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not on the basis of its
subject matter or the viewpoint expressed, but rather on the basis
of the harm the speech causes. In this regard, the Court fundamentally
misreads the St. Paul ordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul
ordinance as regulating expression &quot;addressed to one of [several]
specified disfavored topics,&quot; ante, at 2547 (emphasis supplied),
as policing &quot;disfavored subjects,&quot; ibid. (emphasis supplied),
and as &quot;prohibit[ing] ... speech solely on the basis of the
subjects the speech addresses.&quot; Ante, at 2542 (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulates only
a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based on &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; not a subcategory that
involves discussions that concern those characteristics. (FN9)
The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes expression
that &quot;one knows ... [by its very utterance inflicts injury
on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child pornography
law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled out child pornography
because those publications caused far greater harms than pornography
involving adults.
<P>
Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate fighting
words based on its subject matter, such a regulation would, in
my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above, subject-matter
based regulations on commercial speech are widespread and largely
unproblematic. As we have long recognized, subject-matter regulations
generally do not raise the same concerns of government censorship
and the distortion of public discourse presented by viewpoint
regulations. Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we
have carefully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not
implicated. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
67, 96 S.Ct., at 2450-2451 (emphasizing &quot;the need for absolute
neutrality by the government,&quot; and observing that the contested
statute was not animated by &quot;hostility for the point of view&quot;
of the theatres); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S., at 745-746,
98 S.Ct., at 3038-3039 (stressing that &quot;government must remain
neutral in the marketplace of ideas&quot;); see also FCC v. League
of Women's Voters of California, 468 U.S., at 412-417, 104 S.Ct.,
at 3134-3137 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 554-555, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2916-2917,
69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part).
<P>
Indeed, some subject-matter restrictions are a functional necessity
in contemporary governance: &quot;The First Amendment does not
require States to regulate for problems that do not exist.&quot;
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1856,
119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul ordinance
does not regulate expression based on viewpoint. The Court contends
that the ordinance requires proponents of racial intolerance to
&quot;follow the *2571. Marquis of Queensbury Rules&quot; while
allowing advocates of racial tolerance to &quot;fight freestyle.&quot;
The law does no such thing.
<P>
The Court writes:
<P>
&quot;One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all 'anti-Catholic
bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all 'papists' are, for that
would insult and provoke violence 'on the basis of religion.'
&quot; Ante, at 2548.
<P>
This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point. The
Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to a sign saying
that &quot;all [religious] bigots are misbegotten&quot; is a sign
saying that &quot;all advocates of religious tolerance are misbegotten.&quot;
Assuming such signs could be fighting words (which seems to me
extremely unlikely), neither sign would be banned by the ordinance
for the attacks were not &quot;based on ... religion&quot; but
rather on one's beliefs about tolerance. Conversely (and again
assuming such signs are fighting words), just as the ordinance
would prohibit a Muslim from hoisting a sign claiming that all
Catholics were misbegotten, so the ordinance would bar a Catholic
from hoisting a similar sign attacking Muslims.
<P>
The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle between advocates
of tolerance and advocates of intolerance, the ordinance does
not prevent either side from hurling fighting words at the other
on the basis of their conflicting ideas, but it does bar both
sides from hurling such words on the basis of the target's &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; To extend the Court's
pugilistic metaphor, the St. Paul ordinance simply bans punches
&quot;below the belt&quot;--by either party. It does not, therefore,
favor one side of any debate. (FN10)
<P>
Finally, it is noteworthy that the St. Paul ordinance is, as construed
by the Court today, quite narrow. The St. Paul ordinance does
not ban all &quot;hate speech,&quot; nor does it ban, say, all
cross-burnings or all swastika displays. Rather it only bans a
subcategory of the already narrow category of fighting words.
Such a limited ordinance leaves open and protected a vast range
of expression on the subjects of racial, religious, and gender
equality. As construed by the Court today, the ordinance certainly
does not &quot; 'raise the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.' &quot;
Ante, at 2545. Petitioner is free to burn a cross to announce
a rally or to express his views about racial supremacy, he may
do so on private property or public land, at day or at night,
so long as the burning is not so threatening and so directed at
an individual as to &quot;by its very [execution] inflict injury.&quot;
Such a limited proscription scarcely offends the First Amendment.
<P>
In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates
expressive activity that is wholly proscribable and does so not
on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recognition of the different
harms caused by such activity. Taken together, these several considerations
persuade me that the St. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional
content-based regulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not
overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

FN3. Contrary to Justice WHITE's suggestion, post, at 2550-2551,
petitioner's claim is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the questions
presented in the petition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule
14.1(a). It was clear from the petition and from petitioner's
other filings in this Court (and in the courts below) that his
assertion that the St. Paul ordinance &quot;violat[es] overbreadth
... principles of the First Amendment,&quot; Pet. for Cert. i,
was not just a technical &quot;overbreadth&quot; claim--i.e.,
a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third
parties--but included the contention that the ordinance was &quot;overbroad&quot;
in the sense of restricting more speech than the Constitution
permits, even in its application to him, because it is content-based.
An important component of petitioner's argument is, and has been
all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only
&quot;fighting words&quot; cannot cure this fundamental defect.
Id., at 12, 14, 15-16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner
argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1)
its boundaries were vague, Brief for Petitioner 26, and because
(2) denominating particular expression a &quot;fighting word&quot;
because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience
is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner
5; id., at 13 (&quot;[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory
and vague as 'narrowly construed' &quot;) (emphasis added). At
oral argument, counsel for Petitioner reiterated this second point:
&quot;It is ... one of my positions, that in [punishing only some
fighting words and not others], even though it is a subcategory,
technically, of unprotected conduct, [the ordinance] still is
picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making that
clear through the State.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting
our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our
criteria of what is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the petition.

prohibit only those legally obscene works that contain criticism
of the city government, post, at 2555, but asserts that to be
the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal
Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not,
he asserts, &quot;be rationally related to a legitimate government
interest,&quot; ibid. But of course the only reason that government
interest is not a &quot;legitimate&quot; one is that it violates
the First Amendment. This Court itself has occasionally fused
the First Amendment into the Equal Protection Clause in this fashion,
but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice WHITE cannot
afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis.
See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct.
2286, 2289-2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting
only nonlabor picketing violated the Equal Protection Clause because
there was no &quot;appropriate governmental interest&quot; supporting
the distinction inasmuch as &quot;the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content&quot;);
Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
See generally Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 501,
514, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).
<P>
Justice STEVENS seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion
of obscene anti-government speech as &quot;fantastical,&quot;
post, at 2562, apparently believing that any reference to politics
prevents a finding of obscenity. Unfortunately for the purveyors
of obscenity, that is obviously false. A shockingly hard core
pornographic movie that contains a model sporting a political
tattoo can be found, &quot;taken as a whole [to] lac[k] serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,&quot; Miller
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come
up with other illustrations of a content-based restriction upon
&quot;unprotected speech&quot; that is obviously invalid: the
anti-government libel illustration mentioned earlier, for one.
See supra, at 2543. And of course the concept of racist fighting
words is, unfortunately, anything but a &quot;highly speculative
hypothetica[l],&quot; post, at 2562.
<P>
FN5. Although Justice WHITE asserts that our analysis disregards
&quot;established principles of First Amendment law,&quot; post,
at 2560, he cites not a single case (and we are aware of none)
that even involved, much less considered and resolved, the issue
of content discrimination through regulation of &quot;unprotected&quot;
speech--though we plainly recognized that as an issue in Ferber.
It is of course contrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence
to consider the law on this point conclusively resolved by broad
language in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned.
<P>
FN6. Justice STEVENS cites a string of opinions as supporting
his assertion that &quot;selective regulation of speech based
on content&quot; is not presumptively invalid. Post, at 2563-2564.
Analysis reveals, however, that they do not support it. To begin
with, three of them did not command a majority of the Court, Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 63-73, 96 S.Ct.
<P>
2440, 2448-2454, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 744-748, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3037-3040, 57
L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality); Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights,
418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct.
<P>
2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770 (1974) (plurality), and two others did not
even discuss the First Amendment, Morales v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc., 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992); Jacob
Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).
In any event, all that their contents establish is what we readily
concede: that presumptive invalidity does not mean invariable
invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions as reasonable and
viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums,
see Lehman, supra, 418 U.S., at 301-304, 94 S.Ct., at 2716-2718;
see also Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund,
Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567
(1985), or with respect to certain speech by government employees,
see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d
830 (1973); see also CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 564-567,
93 S.Ct. 2880, 2889-2891, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973).
<P>
*2571_ FN7. St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance
merely regulates that subclass of fighting words which is most
likely to provoke a violent response. But even if one assumes
(as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described,
that would not justify selective regulation under a &quot;secondary
effects&quot; theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct
would be especially correlated with violence is that it conveys
a particularly odious message; because the &quot;chain of causation&quot;
thus necessarily &quot;run[s] through the persuasive effect of
the expressive component&quot; of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2470-2471, 115 L.Ed.2d
504 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that
the St. Paul ordinance regulates on the basis of the &quot;primary&quot;
effect of the speech--i.e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.
<P>
FN8. A plurality of the Court reached a different conclusion with
regard to the Tennessee anti-electioneering statute considered
earlier this Term in Burson v.
<P>
Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
In light of the &quot;logical connection&quot; between electioneering
and the State's compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation
and election fraud--an inherent connection borne out by a &quot;long
history&quot; and a &quot;wide-spread and time-tested consensus,&quot;
id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1855-1858--the plurality concluded
that it was facd with one of those &quot;rare case[s]&quot; in
which the use of a facially content-based restriction was justified
by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas, id., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1857-1858; see also id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
1859 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Justice WHITE and Justice STEVENS
are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to convert the Burson
plurality's passing comment that &quot;[t]he First Amendment does
not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856, into endorsement of the revolutionary
proposition that the suppression of particular ideas can be justified
when only those ideas have been a source of trouble in the past.
Post, at 2555 (WHITE, J.); post, at 2570 (STEVENS, J.).
<P>
FN1. The Court granted certiorari to review the following questions:
<P>
&quot;1. May a local government enact a content-based, 'hate-crime'
ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols, including a Nazi
swastika or a burning cross, on public or private property, which
one knows or has reason to know arouses anger, alarm, or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender
without violating overbreadth and vagueness principles of the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution?
<P>
&quot;2. Can the constitutionality of such a vague and substantially
overbroad content-based restraint of expression be saved by a
limiting construction, like that used to save the vague and overbroad
content-neutral laws, restricting its application to 'fighting
words' or 'imminent lawless action?' &quot; Pet. for Cert. i.
<P>
It has long been the rule of this Court that &quot;[o]nly the
questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,
will be considered by the Court.&quot; This Court's Rule 14.1(a).
This Rule has served to focus the issues presented for review.
But the majority reads the Rule so expansively that any First
Amendment theory would appear to be &quot;fairly included&quot;
within the questions quoted above.
<P>
Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through
its selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 2542,
n. 3, petitioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota
Supreme Court anything approximating the novel theory the majority
adopts today. Most certainly petitioner did not &quot;reiterat[e]&quot;
such a claim at argument; he responded to a question from the
bench. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Previously, this Court has shown the
restraint to refrain from deciding cases on the basis of its own
theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by a state
court of last resort. See, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
217-224, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2321-2325, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).
<P>
Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf.
Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Serv. Comm'n,
461 U.S. 375, 382, n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, n. 6, 76 L.Ed.2d
1 (1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential
concerns are sufficiently weighty that we would never have granted
certiorari, had petitioner sought review of a question based on
the majority's decisional theory.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. &quot;In each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected
category, as well as the unprotected character of particular communications,
have been determined by the judicial evaluation of special facts
that have been deemed to have constitutional significance.&quot;
Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.
485, 504-505, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961-1962, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1948).
<P>
FN3. The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule
belies the majority's claim, see ante, at 2545, that its new theory
is truly concerned with content discrimination. See Part I(C),
infra (discussing the exceptions).
<P>
FN4. This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always
unprotected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost
certainly be protected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U.S. 444, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1828, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). But
in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized
as a &quot;direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange
fisticuffs,&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), to which the fighting words
doctrine, see Part II, infra, applies.
<P>
FN5. The majority relies on Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
1157, 99
<P>
L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), in arguing that the availability of content-neutral
alternatives &quot; 'undercut[s] significantly' &quot; a claim
that content-based
<P>
legislation is &quot; 'necessary to serve the asserted [compelling]
interest.' &quot; Ante, at 2549-2550 (quoting Boos, supra, at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168, and Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (plurality)). Boos does
not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already
had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary,
and the Court pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U.S., at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168. St. Paul lawmakers have made no such
legislative choice.
<P>
Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute
was not narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative
was available. Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos
inside-out by substituting the majority's policy judgment that
a more restrictive alternative could adequately serve the compelling
need identified by St. Paul lawmakers. The result would be: (a)
a statute that was not tailored to fit the need identified by
the government; and (b) a greater restriction on fighting words,
even though the Court clearly believes that fighting words have
protected expressive content. Ante, at 2544.
<P>
FN6. Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating members
of the Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon
&amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991), in which we struck down New York's &quot;Son of Sam&quot;
law, which required &quot;that an accused or convicted criminal's
income from works describing his crime be deposited in an escrow
account.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 504.
<P>
FN7. The Burson dissenters did not complain that the plurality
erred in applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality
was not sufficiently rigorous in its review. 504 U.S., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1865 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
<P>
FN8. Justice SCALIA concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning
that the statute, &quot;though content-based, is constitutional
[as] a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1848. However, nothing
in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a content-based
ban on fighting words would be constitutional were that ban limited
to nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that,
in some settings, political speech, to which &quot;the First Amendment
'has its fullest and most urgent application,' &quot; is entitled
to less constitutional protection than fighting words. Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223,
109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting Monitor
Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d
35 (1971)).
<P>
*2571_ FN9. The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on
obscene works critical of government would fail equal protection
review only because the ban would violate the First Amendment.
Ante, at 2541, n. 2. While decisions such as Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972),
recognize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an
equal protection claim challenging distinctions that impact on
protected expression, id., at 95-99, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292, there
is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis
in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one need
not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the
sort of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based
on senseless distinctions.
<P>
FN10. Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because
it distinguishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.
<P>
FN11. The consequences of the majority's conflation of the rarely-used
secondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating
&quot;speech&quot; and &quot;nonspeech&quot; elements, see generally
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), present another question that
I fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of
the majority's opinion.
<P>
FN12. Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia
v. American Bookseller's Assn., 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S.Ct. 636,
645, 98 L.Ed.2d
<P>
782 (1988), that &quot;the statute must be 'readily susceptible'
to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform
it to constitutional requirements.&quot; In American Bookseller's,
no state court had construed the language in dispute. In that
instance, we certified a question to the state court so that it
would have an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation.
Ibid. In Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216,
95 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), the other case upon
which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that
the ordinance at issue was not &quot;by its plain terms ... easily
susceptible of a narrowing construction,&quot; but that the state
courts had made no effort to restrict the scope of the statute
when it was challenged on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
FN13. Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech,
Johnson v. Texas, 491 U.S., at 414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544, it does
not require us to be subjected to such expression at all times,
in all settings. We have held that such expression may be proscribed
when it intrudes upon a &quot;captive audience.&quot; Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484-485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2502-2503, 101
L.Ed.2d 420 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726,
748-749, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3040-3041, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). And
expression may be limited when it merges into conduct. United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672
(1968); cf. Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106
S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). However, because of the
manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed the St.
Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.
<P>
FN1. The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted
two exceptions, one for &quot;certain media or markets&quot; and
the other for content discrimination based upon &quot;the very
reason that the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot;
Ante, at 2545. These exceptions are, at best, ill-defined. The
Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former, fighting
words such as cross-burning could be proscribed only in certain
neighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe,
or whether, with respect to the second category, fighting words
that create a particular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would
be proscribable. The hypothetical and illusory category of these
two exceptions persuades me that either my description of the
Court's analysis is accurate or that the Court does not in fact
mean much of what it says in its opinion.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct.
1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d
464 (1961).
<P>
FN3. See also Packer Corp v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 52 S.Ct. 273,
76 L.Ed. 643 (1932) (Brandeis, J.) (upholding a statute that prohibited
the advertisement of cigarettes on billboards and street-car placards).
<P>
FN4. The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations
&quot;applies differently in the context of proscribable speech&quot;
than in the context of other speech, ante, at 2545, but its analysis
belies that claim. The Court strikes down the St. Paul ordinance
because it regulates fighting words based on subject matter, despite
the fact that, as demonstrated above, we have long upheld regulations
of commercial speech based on subject matter. The Court's self-description
is inapt: By prohibiting the regulation of fighting words based
on its subject matter, the Court provides the same protection
to fighting words as is currently provided to core political speech.
<P>
FN5. &quot;A word,&quot; as Justice Holmes has noted, &quot;is
not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a
living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according
to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.&quot; Towne
v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 159, 62 L.Ed. 372
(1918); see also Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 201, 84 S.Ct.
1676, 1685, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Warren, C.J., dissenting).
<P>
FN6. Cf. In re Chase, 468 F.2d 128, 139-140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious
belief, refused to rise and stand as the trial judge entered the
courtroom was not subject to contempt proceedings because he was
not present in the courtroom &quot;as a matter of choice&quot;).
<P>
FN7. Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matter
based and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic,
see, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n
of N.Y., 447 U.S., at 537, 100 S.Ct., at 2338, our decisions belie
such claims.
<P>
FN8. The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance
as regulating &quot;a message.&quot; Ante, at 2548. As always,
however, St. Paul's argument must be read in context:
<P>
&quot;Finally, we ask the Court to reflect on the 'content' of
the 'expressive conduct' represented by a 'burning cross.' It
is no less than the first step in an act of racial violence. It
was and unfortunately still is the equivalent of [the] waving
of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gun before it
is fired, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hanging
of the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement,
or even a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the first step in
an act of assault. It can be no more protected than holding a
gun to a victim['s] head. It is perhaps the ultimate expression
of 'fighting words.' &quot; App. to Brief for Petitioner C-6.
<P>
FN9. The Court contends that this distinction is &quot;wordplay,&quot;
reasoning that &quot;[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based
threats] distinct from [the harms] produced by other fighting
words is ... the fact that [the former are] caused by a distinctive
idea.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis added). In this way, the Court
concludes that regulating speech based on the injury it causes
is no different from regulating speech based on its subject matter.
This analysis fundamentally miscomprehends the role of &quot;race,
color, creed, religion [and] gender&quot; in contemporary American
society. One need look no further than the recent social unrest
in the Nation's cities to see that race-based threats may cause
more harm to society and to individuals than other threats. Just
as the statute prohibiting threats against the President is justifiable
because of the place of the President in our social and political
order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threats is justifiable
because of the place of race in our social and political order.
Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and
is so incendiary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that
condition, laws such as St. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable
and justifiable.
<P>
*2571_ FN10. Cf. FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 418, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3137, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984)
(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (&quot;In this case ... the regulation
applies ... to a defined class of ... licensees [who] represent
heterogenous points of view. There is simply no sensible basis
for considering this regulation a viewpoint restriction--or ...
to condemn it as 'content-based'--because it applies equally to
station owners of all shades of opinion&quot;

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence
for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's race. The State Court of
Appeals rejected his challenge to the law's constitutionality,
but the State Supreme Court reversed. Relying on R.A.V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 it held that
the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the
legislature has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the
State's contention that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional
victim selection. It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally
overbroad because the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech
would have a chilling effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted
for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination,
whereas the state statute punishes the subjective mental process.
<P>
Held: Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the
application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing
him. Pp. 2198-2202.
<P>
(a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by
a state court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme
Court did not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized
the statute's practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus,
after resolving any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this
Court may form its own judgment about the law's operative effect.
The State's argument that the statute punishes only conduct does
not dispose of Mitchell's claim, since the fact remains that the
same criminal conduct is more heavily punished if the victim is
selected *2196 because of his protected status than if no such
motive obtains. Pp. 2198-99.
<P>
(b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges
have traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition
to evidence bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for
committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing
judge may not take into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, the Constitution does not erect
a per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are
protected by the First Amendment. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S.
----, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309; Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (plurality opinion).
That Dawson and Barclay did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement
provision does not make them inapposite. Barclay involved the
consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence
a defendant to death, the most severe &quot;enhancement&quot;
of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility
for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under
the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination
laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge.
Nothing in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra, compels a different result
here. The ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at
speech, while the one here is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what
it sees as the greater individual and societal harm inflicted
by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for
the provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'
beliefs or biases. Pp. 2199-2201.
<P>
(c) Because the statute has no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on
free speech, it is not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect
of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence
of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he
commits a serious offense against person or property is too speculative
a hypothesis to support this claim. Moreover, the First Amendment
permits the admission of previous declarations or statements to
establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent,
subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability,
and the like. Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874,
91 L.Ed. 1145. Pp. 2201-02.

<P>
Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was
enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account
of the victim's race. The question presented in this case is whether
this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. We hold that it is not.
<P>
On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men
and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment complex
in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the group discussed
a scene from the motion picture &quot;Mississippi Burning,&quot;
in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. The
group moved outside and Mitchell asked them: &quot; 'Do you all
feel hyped up to move on some white people?' &quot; Brief for
Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, a young white boy approached
the group on the opposite side of the street where they were standing.
As the boy walked by, Mitchell said: &quot; 'You *2197 all want
to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him.' &quot;
Id., at 4-5. Mitchell counted to three and pointed in the boy's
direction. The group ran towards the boy, beat him severely, and
stole his tennis shoes.
<P>
The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four
days.
<P>
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell
was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis.Stat. Secs. 939.05 and
940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum
sentence of two years' imprisonment. Secs. 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e).
But because the jury found that Mitchell had intentionally selected
his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for
Mitchell's offense was increased to seven years under Sec. 939.645.
That provision enhances the maximum penalty for an offense whenever
the defendant &quot;[i]ntentionally selects the person against
whom the crime ... is committed ... because of the race, religion,
color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry
of that person....&quot; Sec. 939.645(1)(b). (FN1) The Circuit
Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated
battery.
<P>
Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit
Court. Then he appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging
the constitutionality of Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision
on First Amendment grounds. (FN2) The Wisconsin Court of Appeals
rejected Mitchell's challenge, 163 Wis.2d 652, 473 N.W.2d 1 (1991),
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court held
that the statute &quot;violates the First Amendment directly by
punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought.&quot;169 Wis.2d 153, 163, 485 N.W.2d 807, 811 (1992). It rejected the
State's contention &quot;that the statute punishes only the 'conduct'
of intentional selection of a victim.&quot; Id., at 164, 485 N.W.2d,
at 812. According to the court, &quot;[t]he statute punishes the
'because of' aspect of the defendant's selection, the reason the
defendant selected the victim, the motive behind the selection.&quot;
Ibid. (emphasis in original). And under R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505
U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), &quot;the Wisconsin
legislature *2198 cannot criminalize bigoted thought with which
it disagrees.&quot; 169 Wis.2d, at 171, 485 N.W.2d, at 815.
<P>
The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute
was unconstitutionally overbroad. It reasoned that, in order to
prove that a defendant intentionally selected his victim because
of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to
introduce evidence of the defendant's prior speech, such as racial
epithets he may have uttered before the commission of the offense.
This evidentiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would
have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on those who feared the possibility
of prosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. See
id., at 174, 485 N.W.2d, at 816. Finally, the court distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the &quot;subjective
mental process&quot; of selecting a victim because of his protected
status, whereas antidiscrimination laws prohibit &quot;objective
acts of discrimination.&quot; Id., at 176, 485 N.W.2d, at 817.
(FN3)
<P>
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question
presented and the existence of a conflict of authority among state
high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's
penalty-enhancement provision, (FN4) 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct.
810, 121 L.Ed.2d 683 (1992). We reverse.
<P>
Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's
conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted thought and not conduct.
There is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction
of a state statute. R.A.V., supra, at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2541-2542; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24, 102
S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982);
<P>
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895, 93 L.Ed.
1131 (1949). In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts
had defined the term &quot; 'breach of the peace,' &quot; in a
city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include &quot;
'stirs the public to anger ... or creates a disturbance.' &quot;
Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct., at 895. We held this construction to be binding
on us. But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly
speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular statutory word or phrase. Rather,
it merely characterized the &quot;practical effect&quot; of the
statute for First Amendment purposes. See 169 *2199 Wis.2d, at
166-167, 485 N.W.2d, at 813 (&quot;Merely because the statute
refers in a literal sense to the intentional 'conduct' of selecting,
does not mean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and
practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought&quot;).
This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities as to the
meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form our own judgment
as to its operative effect.
<P>
The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted thought,
as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead punishes only
conduct. While this argument is literally correct, it does not
dispose of Mitchell's First Amendment challenge. To be sure, our
cases reject the &quot;view that an apparently limitless variety
of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging
in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.&quot; United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20
L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); accord, R.A.V., 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2544; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727,
2729, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam );  Cox v. Louisiana,
379 U.S. 536, 555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 464, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965). Thus,
a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive
conduct protected by the First Amendment. See Roberts v. United
States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255, 82 L.Ed.2d
462 (1984) (&quot;[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative
impact ... are entitled to no constitutional protection&quot;);
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct.
3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (&quot;The First Amendment
does not protect violence&quot;).
<P>
But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the same
criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is
selected because of his race or other protected status than if
no such motive obtained. Thus, although the statute punishes criminal
conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated
by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the same
conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all.
Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's
discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates
the First Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.
<P>
Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety
of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining
what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2605, 115 L.Ed.2d
720 (1991); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct.
589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.
241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). The defendant's
motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See
1 W. LeFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 3.6(b),
p. 324 (1986) (&quot;Motives are most relevant when the trial
judge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommon for
a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because he was acting
with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad
motives&quot;); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 156, 107 S.Ct.
1676, 1687, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) (&quot;Deeply ingrained in our
legal tradition is the idea that the more purposeful is the criminal
conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the
more severely it ought to be punished&quot;). Thus, in many States
the commission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary
gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the capital-sentencing
statute. See, e.g., Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 13-703(F)(5) (1989);
Fla.Stat. Sec.
<P>
921.141(5)(f) (Supp.1992); Miss.Code Ann. Sec. 99-19-101(5)(f)
(Supp.1992); N.C.Gen.Stat. Sec. 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo.Stat.
Sec. 6-2-102(h)(vi) (Supp.1992).
<P>
*2200 But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration
by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced
evidence at a capital-sentencing hearing that the defendant was
a member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because &quot;the
evidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstract beliefs,&quot;
we held that its admission violated the defendant's First Amendment
rights. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1098. In so holding, however,
we emphasized that &quot;the Constitution does not erect a per
se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs
and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and
associations are protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1094. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983) (plurality opinion),
we allowed the sentencing judge to take into account the defendant's
racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed
that the defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Army and
desire to provoke a &quot;race war&quot; were related to the murder
of a white man for which he was convicted. See id., at 942-944,
103 S.Ct., at 3421-3422. Because &quot;the elements of racial
hatred in [the] murder&quot; were relevant to several aggravating
factors, we held that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence
into account in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,
and n. 7, 103 S.Ct., at 3424, and n. 7.
<P>
Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite because
they did not involve application of a penalty-enhancement provision.
But in Barclay we held that it was permissible for the sentencing
court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining
whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe
&quot;enhancement&quot; of all. And the fact that the Wisconsin
Legislature has decided, as a general matter, that bias-motivated
offenses warrant greater maximum penalties across the board does
not alter the result here. For the primary responsibility for
fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v.
Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1139, 63 L.Ed.2d 382
(1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280,
1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958).
<P>
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute
is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory
motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays the same role
under the Wisconsin statute as it does under federal and state
antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously upheld against
constitutional challenge. See Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S., at
628, 104 S.Ct., at 3255; Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S.
69, 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2235, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2597, 49 L.Ed.2d 415
(1976). Title VII, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer
to discriminate against an employee &quot;because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, we rejected the
argument that Title VII infringed employers' First Amendment rights.
And more recently, in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2546, we cited Title VII (as well as 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242 and 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible
content-neutral regulation of conduct.
<P>
Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different
result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to
a municipal ordinance prohibiting the use of &quot; 'fighting
words' that insult, or provoke violence, 'on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.' &quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2547 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,
St. Paul, Minn., Legis.Code Sec. 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance
only proscribed a class of &quot;fighting words&quot; deemed particularly
offensive by the city--i.e., those &quot;that contain ... messages
of 'bias-motivated' hatred,&quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at *2201 2547 we held that it violated the rule against content-based
discrimination. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547-2548. But
whereas the ordinance struck down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed
at expression (i.e., &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;messages,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547, the statute in this case is
aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired
conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual
and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its
amici, bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory
crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and
incite community unrest. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27;
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as Amicus Curiae 18-22; Brief
for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 17-19;
Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici Curiae 9-10;
<P>
Brief for Congressman Charles E. Schumer et al. as Amici Curiae
8-9. The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides
an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision
over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases.
As Blackstone said long ago, &quot;it is but reasonable that among
crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished,
which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.&quot;
4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.
<P>
Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that
the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because
of its &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech. Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the statute is &quot;overbroad&quot;
because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations
may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's protected status.
<P>
Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills
free expression with respect to such matters by those concerned
about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in
the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We
find no merit in this contention.
<P>
The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely
than that contemplated in traditional &quot;overbreadth&quot;
cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing
his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that if he later commits
an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered
at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of
the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-enhancement.
To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to
one side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute, such
as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis.Stat. Sec. 941.01
(1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive
of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated.
We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen suppressing
his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will
be introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious
offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative
a hypothesis to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim.
<P>
The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary
use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove
motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations
or statements is commonly admitted in criminal trials subject
to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and
the like. Nearly half a century ago, in Haupt v. United States,
330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874, 91 L.Ed. 1145 (1947), we rejected
a contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt
was tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the
Constitution (Art. III, Sec. 3), may depend very much on proof
of motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out
of &quot;adherence *2202. to the enemy&quot; rather than &quot;parental
solicitude,&quot; id., at 641, 67 S.Ct., at 878, the Government
introduced evidence of conversations that had taken place long
prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements
showing Haupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility
towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argument that this
evidence was improperly admitted. While &quot;[s]uch testimony
is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are
not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion
with our own government or quite proper appreciation of the land
of birth,&quot; we held that &quot;these statements ... clearly
were admissible on the question of intent and adherence to the
enemy.&quot; Id., at 642, 67 S.Ct., at 879. See also Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251-252, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1791-1792,
104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion) (allowing evidentiary
use of defendant's speech in evaluating Title VII discrimination
claim); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 594, 89 S.Ct. 1354,
1366-1367, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969).
<P>
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment
rights were not violated by the application of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
provision in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.

FN1. At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
statute provided:
<P>
&quot;(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties
for the underlying crime are increased as provided in sub. (2):
<P>
&quot;(a) Commits a crime under chs. 939 to 948.
<P>
&quot;(b) Intentionally selects the person against whom the crime
<P>
under par. (a) is committed or selects the property which is damaged
or otherwise affected by the crime under par. (a) because of the
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of
that property.
<P>
&quot;(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a misdemeanor other than a Class A misdemeanor, the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is one year in the county jail.
<P>
&quot;(b) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a Class A misdemeanor, the penalty increase under this section
changes the status of the crime to a felony and the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is 2 years.
<P>
&quot;(c) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is a felony, the
maximum fine prescribed by law for the crime may be increased
by not more than $5,000 and the maximum period of imprisonment
prescribed by law for the crime may be increased by not more than
5 years.
<P>
&quot;(3) This section provides for the enhancement of the penalties
applicable for the underlying crime. The court shall direct that
the trier of fact find a special verdict as to all of the issues
specified in sub. (1).
<P>
&quot;(4) This section does not apply to any crime if proof of
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry is required for a conviction for that crime.&quot;
Wis.Stat. Sec. 939.645 (1989-1990). The statute was amended in
1992, but the amendments are not at issue in this case.
<P>
FN2. Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment
equal protection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of
Appeals held that Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and
rejected his vagueness challenge outright. 163 Wis.2d 652, 473
N.W.2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address
both claims. 169 Wis.2d 153, 158, n. 2, 485 N.W.2d 807, 809, n.
2 (1992). Mitchell renews his Fourteenth Amendment claims in this
Court. But since they were not developed below and plainly fall
outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do
not reach them either.
<P>
FN3. Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished
discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have
upheld it. See 169 Wis.2d at 181, 485 N.W.2d, at 819 (Abrahamson,
J.); id., at 187-195, 485 N.W.2d at 821-825 (Bablitch, J.).
<P>
FN4. Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions
similar to the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e.g.,
Cal.Penal Code Ann. Sec. 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp.1993); Fla.Stat.
Sec. 775.085 (1991); Mont.Code Ann. Sec. 45-5-222 (1992); Vt.Stat.Ann.,
Tit. 13, Sec. 1455 (Supp.1992). Proposed federal legislation to
the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H.R.
4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed to pass the Senate,
S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state high courts are
divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes
and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,
e.g., State v. Plowman, 314 Or. 157, 838 P.2d 558 (1992) (upholding
Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St.3d 566, 597 N.E.2d
450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis.2d 153, 485 N.W.2d
807 (1992) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,
bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States.
See, e.g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium et al. as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation
League et al. as Amici Curiae 4-7; Brief for Atlanta et al. as
Amici Curiae 3-12. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics
Act, Pub.L. 101-275, Sec. 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at
28 U.S.C. Sec. 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp. III), directing the
Attorney General to compile data &quot;about crimes that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,
or ethnicity.&quot; Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation reported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated
offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of
intimidation, 1,301 incidents of vandalism, 796 simple assaults,
773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders. See Brief for the Crown
Heights Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 1A-7A.

Before ANDERSON and TACHA, Circuit Judges, and COOK, District
Judge. (FN*)
<P>
TACHA, Circuit Judge.
<P>
Appellants appeal an order of the district court granting defendants'
motion for summary judgment. Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v.
Romer, 750 F.Supp. 1041 (D.Colo.1990). On appeal, appellants contend
that the Governor of Colorado violated their First Amendment rights
by using state resources to defeat an amendment on the ballot
at a Colorado general election. Appellee Romer cross appeals asserting
that appellants lack standing to pursue this action. We exercise
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 and dismiss the appeal
for lack of standing.
<P>
BACKGROUND
<P>
In October of 1988, the citizens of Colorado placed an initiative,
commonly referred to as Amendment six, on the ballot at the Colorado
general election. Amendment six focused on statewide tax reform
and would have allowed the citizens of Colorado to vote directly
on any significant change in state tax laws.
<P>
Appellee Romer, the Governor of the State of Colorado, and defendant
Citizens for Representative Government, of which defendants Phil
Fox and Clark Shaw were members, publicly opposed the amendment.
Appellants assert that Governor Romer used numerous public resources
to publicly oppose the amendment. These resources allegedly included
staff time, equipment and supplies, travel resources, and facilities
at the state mansion and state capital office. Amendment six eventually
was defeated in the Colorado general election.
<P>
After the defeat of the amendment, appellants filed a suit in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Appellants claimed that
Governor Romer violated their First Amendment rights by using
state resources and the power and prestige of his office to oppose
the amendment. Appellants also asserted that the Governor and
the other defendants combined in a conspiracy to violate the appellants'
constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985(3) and
common law.
<P>
Asserting that appellants lacked standing and that they failed
to state a claim for relief for a violation of the United States
Constitution, defendants moved for summary judgment. Appellants
cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court *1396 denied
appellants' motion and then addressed defendants' motion, denying
it in part and granting it in part. The district court found that
appellants had standing to sue, but that Governor Romer's expenditures
were &quot;de minimis&quot; so that the appellants failed to state
a claim.
<P>
DISCUSSION
<P>
On appeal, Romer contends that appellants lack standing to pursue
this action. Because we agree with this contention, we address
only the standing argument and do not address the merits of appellants'
contentions on appeal. In this case, appellants are two associations,
the Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Colorado Libertarian Party,
and a number of individuals.
<P>
Before a party may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
Article III requires that the party demonstrate that (1) &quot;
'he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as
a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant' &quot;;
(2) &quot;the injury 'fairly can be traced to the challenged action'
&quot;; and (3) the injury &quot; 'is likely to be redressed by
a favorable decision.' &quot; Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., 454
U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (quoting
Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99
S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) and Simon v. Eastern Ky.
<P>
Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924,
1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). If a party satisfies these minimum
constitutional requirements, then a court may still deny standing
for prudential reasons if the injury alleged constitutes a &quot;generalized
grievance&quot; that more appropriately should be addressed by
the representative branches. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The district court concluded that plaintiffs &quot;alleged sufficient
injury for standing.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. Romer,
750 F.Supp. 1041, 1043 (D.Colo.1990). In support of this conclusion,
the district court stated that &quot;[t]he harm consists of the
additional burden imposed on the plaintiffs by the defendants'
allegedly unconstitutional acts. Like the plaintiffs in Common
Cause v. Bolger, [512 F.Supp. 26, 30 (D.D.C.1980) ], the plaintiffs
here have alleged that their campaign for Amendment 6 would not
have been so difficult (and, in fact, might have been successful)
but for the defendants' acts.&quot; Id. We must now determine
whether the individuals or either of the associations, the Colorado
Libertarian Party or the Colorado Taxpayers Union, have standing
to bring this suit.
<P>
A. The Colorado Libertarian Party
<P>
Appellants contend that the Libertarian Party has standing to
sue because it seeks judicial relief for injuries to the organization.
An organization has standing on its own behalf if it meets the
standing requirements that apply to individuals. Havens Realty
Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,
71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). To have standing, plaintiffs must allege
&quot; 'such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy'
as to warrant ... invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.&quot;
Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp.,
429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (quoting
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d
663 (1962)). Appellants must demonstrate that their alleged injury
is an &quot;injury in fact, economic or otherwise.&quot; Association
of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152,
90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The injury must be &quot;
'distinct and palpable,' &quot; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L.Ed.2d
66 (1979) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct.
2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)), and &quot;real and immediate,&quot;
not abstract, conjectural, speculative, or hypothetical, City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660,
1664-65, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).
<P>
Appellants claim that Governor Romer used his staff and the resources
of his office to defeat the tax initiative supported by the Libertarian
Party and thus forced *1397 the Party to bear a greater burden
in its attempt to pass the amendment. Appellants claim that under
Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124, this drain on resources
is a concrete and demonstrable injury.
<P>
In Havens, the Supreme Court found that an organization was entitled
to standing on its own behalf because the organization alleged
that an apartment owner's racial steering practices had perceptively
impaired the organization's ability to provide counseling and
referral services for low and moderate income home seekers. The
Court stated that &quot;[s]uch [a] concrete and demonstrable injury
to the organization's activities--with the consequent drain on
the organization's resources--constitutes far more than simply
a setback to the organization's abstract social interests.&quot;
Id. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124.
<P>
Appellants' argument that they were forced to counteract the Governor's
activities through the expenditure of additional funds is purely
conjectural.
<P>
Such an argument simply does not demonstrate that the Libertarian
Party or its members have suffered a distinct and concrete injury.
At most, the Libertarian Party's allegations suggest only that
the organization has received a minor setback to its organizational
purpose. The Libertarian Party's argument would require this court
to engage in a futile act of speculation in order to determine
the extent of some remote, uncertain injury. This type of conjectural
injury cannot establish standing under Havens. In Havens, the
defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct could be tied directly
to a concrete harm inflicted upon the primary activity of the
plaintiff organization--the organization's counseling and referral
efforts were rendered futile when the defendant turned away referred
applicants. Here, appellants' actions in spending additional funds
simply cannot be traced to the Governor's allegedly illegal expenditures.
It is pure conjecture to assume that Governor Romer's activities
caused appellants to drain their resources. Thus, we conclude
that appellants have not &quot;allege[d] [a] personal injury fairly
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely
to be redressed by the requested relief.&quot; Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The Libertarian Party also argues that it suffered an injury when
its First Amendment rights were chilled. Appellants contend that
the allegedly illegal expenditures by the Governor effectively
imposed a tax upon the Libertarian Party in its effort to exercise
its First Amendment right to petition. Essentially, appellants
claim that the dilution of Party resources chilled the exercise
of First Amendment rights.
<P>
We cannot agree with the characterization of the Governor's activities
as a &quot;tax&quot; on the Libertarian Party or its members'
First Amendment right to petition. The Governor's activities in
no way prevented the Libertarian Party or its members from petitioning
the government. The Governor's activities only commenced once
the amendment was placed on the ballot. The Governor's allegedly
unlawful activities never prevented members of the Libertarian
Party from associating, speaking on behalf of the amendment, or
voting on the amendment. Further, the Libertarian Party and its
members failed to demonstrate that Romer's activities impacted
their ability to petition the government of Colorado in the future.
Thus, neither the Libertarian Party nor its members has demonstrated
that First Amendment rights were chilled.
<P>
The Libertarian Party contends that even if it has not been injured,
it is entitled to standing on behalf of its members. In Hunt v.
Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343,
97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), the Supreme Court
announced a three-part test for associational standing:
<P>
[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members
when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in
their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane
to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted
nor the relief *1398 requested requires the participation of the
individual members in the lawsuit.
<P>
Because we conclude that the Libertarian Party's members do not
have standing to sue in their own right, the Party is not entitled
to associational standing.
<P>
B. The Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Individual Appellants
<P>
The individual appellants claim that they are entitled to standing
as taxpayers. The Colorado Taxpayers Union asserts standing as
an organization suing on behalf of its tax-paying members. Appellants
argue that the Governor illegally used state tax funds in order
to defeat Amendment six and that this misappropriation entitles
them to standing under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942,
20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The district court stated that &quot;[t]he
essence of the plaintiffs' position is that when the Governor
becomes an advocate against a citizen initiative, he has exceeded
the limits of his official power and interfered in the process
by which the people exercise their sovereign right to change the
authority of the officials who govern them.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers
Union, Inc., 750 F.Supp. at 1044. Appellee Romer argues that this
claim is insufficient to give appellants taxpayer standing under
Flast.
<P>
Most of the taxpayer standing cases addressed by the Supreme Court
deal with federal taxpayer standing. The general prohibition against
federal taxpayer standing originated in Frothingham v. Mellon,
262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). In Frothingham,
the Supreme Court held that a federal taxpayer lacks standing
to sue to enjoin federal officials from enforcing a  federal statute
authorizing appropriations of public money. The federal taxpayer
attacked the Maternity Act of 1921, which established a federal
program of grants to states to reduce maternal and infant mortality.
The taxpayer alleged that Congress, in enacting the Act, exceeded
its powers under Article I of the Constitution. She argued that
&quot;the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to
increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property
without due process of law.&quot; Id. at 486, 43 S.Ct. at 600.
<P>
The Court began its analysis by noting that &quot;[t]he interest
of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys
is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent
their misuse in not inappropriate. It is upheld by a large number
of state cases and is the rule of this court.&quot; Id. The Court
then distinguished federal taxpayers from municipal taxpayers
and stated that a federal taxpayer's &quot;interest in the moneys
of the treasury ... is comparatively minute and indeterminable&quot;
and that &quot;the effect upon future taxation, of any payment
out of the [Treasury's] funds, [is] remote, fluctuating and uncertain.&quot;
Id. at 487, 43 S.Ct. at 601. Thus, the Court found that the federal
taxpayer lacked standing.
<P>
In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947
(1968), the Court created an exception to the bar on federal taxpayer
standing in the context of Establishment Clause challenges. The
Court asked &quot;whether the Frothingham barrier should be lowered
when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it
violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First
Amendment.&quot; Id. at 85, 88 S.Ct. at 1944. To resolve this
issue, the Court noted that a court must &quot;determine whether
there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated.&quot; Id. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953.
The Court then concluded that the nexus requirement for a federal
taxpayer contains two aspects. &quot;First, the taxpayer must
establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative
enactment attacked.&quot; Id. Under this first aspect, a taxpayer
can only challenge the unconstitutionality of exercises of congressional
power under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Article I, Section
8 of the Constitution. The second aspect requires that a taxpayer
establish &quot;a nexus between that status and the precise nature
of the constitutional infringement alleged.&quot; Id. To satisfy
this requirement, a taxpayer must show that the challenged action
&quot;exceeds specific  constitutional limitations imposed upon
the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power.&quot;
Id. at 102- *1399 03, 88 S.Ct. at 1953-54. In Flast, the taxpayers
satisfied both aspects of the required nexus because they challenged
a congressional exercise of power under Article I, Section 8 and
because they asserted that the congressional expenditures violated
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which specifically
limits the taxing and spending power of Article I, Section 8.
<P>
After Flast, the Court consistently has adhered to the &quot;narrow
exception [Flast ] created to the general rule against taxpayer
standing.&quot; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 618, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 2579, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). In Valley Forge Christian
College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State,
Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), the
Court held that federal taxpayers lacked standing to challenge
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW) decision
to give property to a religious institution. The Court rejected
the taxpayers' standing argument because the &quot;source of their
complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW
to transfer a parcel of federal property.&quot; Id. at 479, 102
S.Ct. at 762. The Court also reasoned that &quot;the property
transfer about which [the taxpayers] complain was not an exercise
of authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause.&quot;
Id. at 480, 102 S.Ct. at 762. (FN1) Thus, the Court has indicated
that Flast applies only to cases in which a federal taxpayer challenges
a congressional appropriation made pursuant to Article I, Section
8 that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment. See United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct.
2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974);
<P>
Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,
228, 94 S.Ct.
<P>
2925, 2935, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974); Flast, 392 U.S. at 114, 115,
88 S.Ct. at 1959, 1960 (Stewart, J., concurring and Fortas, J.,
concurring); see also Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912, 916 (6th
Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d
148 (1988).
<P>
Both parties mistakenly rely on Flast to resolve whether appellants
qualify for taxpayer standing in this case. Flast does not directly
govern this appeal because it applies to federal taxpayer standing
issues, not questions relating to standing for state taxpayers.
Although neither Frothingham nor Flast analyzes questions of state
taxpayer standing invoked to challenge state taxes or expenditures,
the Supreme Court briefly addressed the issue in Doremus v. Board
of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).
<P>
In Doremus, New Jersey state taxpayers sued the State of New Jersey
seeking a declaratory judgment that a state law authorizing public
school teachers to read from the Bible violated the First Amendment.
The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing because
they did not allege any direct injury to themselves. The Court
stated that [t]here is no allegation that this activity is supported
by any separate tax or paid for from any particular appropriation
or that it adds any sum whatever to the cost of conducting the
school. No information is given as to what kind of taxes are paid
by appellants and there is no averment that the Bible reading
increases any tax they do pay or that as taxpayers they are, will,
or possibly can be out of pocket because of it.
<P>
Id. at 433, 72 S.Ct. at 397. The Court reiterated that a taxpayer
&quot; 'must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid,
but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining
some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely
that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'
&quot; Id. at 434, 72 S.Ct. at 397 (quoting Commonwealth of Mass.
v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601, 67 L.Ed. 1078
(1923)). The Court held that &quot;[t]he taxpayer's action can
meet this test, but only *1400 when it is a good-faith pocketbook
action.&quot; Id. Thus, we must determine whether appellants'
action satisfies the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement.
<P>
After Doremus, the federal courts have addressed the issue of
state taxpayer standing and the type of claim that satisfies the
good-faith pocketbook requirement infrequently. In Hoohuli v.
Ariyoshi, 741 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir.1984), the Ninth Circuit examined
the issue of state taxpayer standing and concluded that the plaintiffs
met the Doremus requirements. In Hoohuli, state taxpayers brought
an action challenging a system established by the State of Hawaii
that disbursed benefits to residents who had descended from aboriginal
inhabitants of the islands. The taxpayers claimed that &quot;their
tax dollars were being spent on a program which disbursed benefits
based on impermissible racial classifications.&quot; Id. at 1172.
<P>
After reviewing Frothingham and Doremus, the Ninth Circuit concluded
that &quot;[s]tate taxpayers could still maintain taxpayer suits
if their pleadings were sufficient. They were sufficient if they
set forth the relationship between taxpayer, tax dollars, and
the allegedly illegal government activity.&quot; Id. at 1178 (citation
omitted). To reach this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reviewed
Flast and its progeny and found that because the Supreme Court
did not discuss Doremus in the second part of the Flast nexus
test, it implicitly distinguished between standing requirements
for federal and state taxpayers. Id. at 1179. Thus, the Ninth
Circuit decided that state taxpayer standing remained unchanged
after Flast and must be guided by Doremus in its original form.
Id. at 1179-80.
<P>
Based on this analysis, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs
had satisfied the &quot;good-faith pocketbook action&quot; of
Doremus. Each of the plaintiffs set forth his or her status as
a taxpayer. The taxpayers challenged the appropriation, transfer
and spending of taxpayers' money from the general fund of the
state treasury. Further, the taxpayers alleged that they &quot;ha[d]
been burdened with the necessity to provide more taxes to support&quot;
the program.
<P>
Id. at 1180. The Ninth Circuit concluded that &quot;[t]he pleadings
set forth with specificity amounts of money appropriated and spent
for allegedly unlawful purposes.&quot; Id. Thus, under the test
announced by the Ninth Circuit, a taxpayer must satisfy three
requirements: (1) taxpayer status; (2) the appropriation of monies
from the state's general funds; and (3) the spending of those
funds for allegedly unlawful purposes. (FN2) Under this standard,
a taxpayer need not demonstrate that &quot;her tax burden will
be lightened by elimination of the questioned expenditure.&quot;
Cammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1991), petition for cert.
filed, 60 USLW 3406 (Nov. 12, 1991). (FN3)
<P>
The Eighth Circuit, in Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall,
891 F.2d 1354 (8th Cir.1989), agreed with the Ninth Circuit's
approach to state taxpayer standing. In Randall, the plaintiffs,
a teachers' union and its president, brought an action challenging
the constitutionality of the Minnesota Post-Secondary Enrollment
Options Act. Pursuant to the Act, public high school students
in their junior and senior years could take advanced courses at
two- and four-year colleges, some of which were religiously affiliated.
The plaintiffs alleged that the Act violated the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Protesting the disbursement of
tax money to sectarian schools and arguing that reallocation of
funds reduced money available for his salary, the president of
the teachers' union asserted standing as a taxpayer. *1401 The
district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing because
it believed that to achieve state taxpayer standing, the plaintiff
would have to show an increase in his tax bill under Doremus.
Id. at 1357. The Eighth Circuit disagreed, concluding that Doremus
did not require a showing of an increased tax burden. The court
reasoned that &quot;only a taxpayer really suffers a distinct
injury from the improper use of public money in violation of the
establishment clause&quot; and &quot;that taxpayer standing was
created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims.&quot;
Id. at 1358. The Eighth Circuit concluded, &quot;we do not believe
that state taxpayers are required to show an increase in their
tax burdens to allege sufficient injury.&quot; Id.
<P>
The Sixth Circuit addressed the issue of state taxpayer standing
in Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488
U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d 148 (1988). In Taub, a state
taxpayer brought an action against Kentucky, its governor, and
other executive officers to prevent them from spending state tax
revenues in connection with the construction of an automotive
assembly plant. The plaintiff, who paid approximately $1,200 dollars
in state property taxes, claimed that &quot;the action of the
Commonwealth and various officials of the executive branch amount[ed]
to the taking of  private property through taxation for other
than a public purpose.&quot; Id. at 914. After reviewing the federal
taxpayer standing cases, the court noted that few cases have addressed
the standing of state taxpayers where the Establishment Clause
is not an issue, whereas municipal taxpayer standing has been
recognized in a variety of contexts. Id. at 917. The Sixth Circuit
then noted that challenges to the Establishment Clause create
a unique situation in state taxpayer standing cases. Relying on
the Supreme Court's notation in School District of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 380 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3220 n. 5, 87
L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), that the Court has &quot;adjudicated [numerous]
Establishment Clause challenges by state taxpayers to programs
for aiding nonpublic schools,&quot; the Sixth Circuit stated that
&quot;[t]his observation [by the Supreme Court] points up the
distinctive treatment of standing when the Establishment Clause
is involved, but does not indicate any rule with respect to other
state taxpayer suits.&quot; Taub, 842 F.2d at 917.
<P>
After undertaking the preceding analysis and reviewing Doremus,
the court conclude[d] that the requirements for federal taxpayer
standing announced in Frothingham control the issue of state taxpayer
standing, at least in those cases where violation of the Establishment
Clause is not alleged.... In order to have standing, a state taxpayer
must allege direct and palpable injury with sufficient specificity
to meet the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus.
<P>
Id. at 918. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's
conclusion in Hoohuli that a state taxpayer must only allege that
appropriated funds were spent for unlawful purposes. Id. at 918-19.
In addition to this requirement, the court required that &quot;[a]
state taxpayer ... tie such allegations of illegal appropriations
and expenditures to a specific claim of some direct and palpable
injury threatened or suffered.&quot; Id. at 919.
<P>
After considering the cases relating to both federal and state
taxpayer standing, we conclude that, where an Establishment Clause
violation is not asserted, a state taxpayer must allege that appropriated
funds were spent for an allegedly unlawful purpose and that the
illegal appropriations and expenditures are tied to a direct and
palpable injury threatened or suffered. Only by meeting these
requirements will a state taxpayer satisfy the &quot;good-faith
pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus. A state taxpayer must
demonstrate that she will be &quot;out of pocket&quot; because
of the allegedly illegal appropriation. Doremus, 342 U.S. at 433,
72 S.Ct. at 396.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the Supreme Court's
decision in ASARCO, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 109 S.Ct. 2037,
104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). In ASARCO, numerous individual state taxpayers
and the Arizona Education Association, representing approximately
20,000 public *1402 school teachers in the State of Arizona, brought
a suit in Arizona state court seeking a declaration that a state
statute governing mineral leases on state land was void. The plaintiffs
challenged the state statute on grounds that it did not comply
with the methods Congress required the State to follow before
leasing or selling the lands granted by the United States in the
New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 557. Because
the state court interpreted federal law, the Court addressed whether
the plaintiffs would have had standing had the action originally
been brought in federal court.
<P>
The Court noted that the general bar on federal taxpayer suits
announced in Frothingham does not necessarily apply to municipal
taxpayers &quot;if it has been shown that the 'peculiar relation
of the corporate taxpayer to the [municipal] corporation' makes
the taxpayer's interest in the application of municipal revenues
'direct and immediate.' &quot; ASARCO, 109 S.Ct. at 2043 (quoting
Frothingham, 262 U.S. at 486-87, 43 S.Ct. at 600-01) (alteration
in original).
<P>
The Court then noted that &quot;we have likened state taxpayers
to federal taxpayers, and thus we have refused to confer standing
upon a state taxpayer absent a showing of 'direct injury,' pecuniary
or otherwise.&quot; Id. (quoting Doremus, 342 U.S. at 434, 72
S.Ct. at 397). The Court concluded that the state taxpayers were
not entitled to standing because &quot;[t]he possibility that
taxpayers will receive any direct pecuniary relief from this lawsuit
is 'remote, fluctuating and uncertain,' as stated in Frothingham,
supra, and consequently the claimed injury is not 'likely to be
redressed by a favorable decision.' &quot; Id. (quoting Valley
Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 758). (FN4)
<P>
After reviewing the reasoning in ASARCO, we conclude that we must
reject the Ninth Circuit's formulation of state taxpayer standing
because it equates state taxpayers with municipal taxpayers for
standing purposes. See Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770 (&quot;we conclude
that municipal taxpayer standing ... mirrors our threshold for
state taxpayer standing&quot;). Supreme Court jurisprudence indicates
that state taxpayers must be likened to federal taxpayers. Thus,
in addition to demonstrating that money was appropriated and spent
for an allegedly unlawful purpose, a state taxpayer must show
that a distinct and palpable injury resulted from the allegedly
illegal appropriation or expenditure. To show such an injury,
a state taxpayer must allege that he has suffered a monetary loss
due to the allegedly unlawful activity's effect on his tax liability.
(FN5)
<P>
Requiring a distinct and palpable injury for state taxpayers comports
with notions of federalism that are central to our system of government.
In the federal taxpayer standing cases, the Supreme Court has
restricted standing to prevent the judicial branch from intruding
into the provinces of the executive and the legislative branches.
We agree with the Sixth Circuit that [t]his separation of powers
concern has a counterpoint which should be considered when a state
taxpayer seeks to have a federal court enjoin the appropriation
and spending activities of a state government.
<P>
Considerations of federalism should signal the same caution in
these circumstances as concern for preservation of the proper
separation of powers in an &quot;all federal&quot; action.
<P>
Taub, 842 F.2d at 919. As the dissent in Hoohuli stated, *1403.
Doremus requires a state taxpayer plaintiff to demonstrate &quot;a
good-faith pocketbook action,&quot; which appears to parallel
the core article III injury-in-fact requirement. But when state
taxpayers attack state spending in federal court, another major
consideration operates: the integrity of our government's federalist
structure. Unnecessary or abstract decisions by federal courts
in cases where there is no case or controversy could unduly constrict
experimental state welfare legislation and undermine local self-determination.
<P>
Hoohuli, 741 F.2d at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting) (citations
omitted). In this case we have an especially compelling federalism
concern that dictates careful attention to the threshold case
or controversy requirement of standing. This case involves a citizen
initiative effort. The right to initiate legislation is a unique
state-created right. The allegations in this case suggest that
the elected chief executive officer of the state cannot take an
active official role in the state-created initiative process.
We can discern few areas so sacrosanct as protection of state
self-determination. The mere allegation of federal constitutional
violations cannot be allowed to clothe a state governmental decisionmaking
process with the ill-fitting garments of federal court scrutiny.
The &quot;direct injury&quot; requirement for standing that has
flourished since Frothingham and Doremus and that defines the
appropriate litigants in a state taxpayer case proves yet again
the wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution when they tied federal
court jurisdiction to the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement
and its attendant standing, ripeness, and mootness doctrines.
This case proves the continuing importance of judicial vigilance
over these time-tested doctrines. Absent such vigilance, we would
seriously undermine the constitutional commitment to federalism.
<P>
In this case, appellants allege that funds were appropriated and
spent for an unlawful purpose; however, they do not allege a distinct
and palpable injury that results from an increased tax liability.
Instead, appellants merely allege that the Governor's allegedly
illegal activities forced them to spend additional funds to offset
his efforts. &quot;[A] taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue
of his liability for taxes.&quot; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 478,
102 S.Ct. at 762. Appellants have not alleged that they have suffered
any injury whatsoever as a result of paying increased taxes to
fund the Governor's activities. Because appellants have not alleged
an injury related to tax liability, they have not shown that they
have suffered a distinct and palpable injury as a result of the
allegedly illegal appropriations or expenditures. Thus, the individual
appellants do not satisfy the good-faith pocketbook requirement
of Doremus and are not entitled to standing as state taxpayers.
Likewise, the Colorado Taxpayers Union lacks associational standing
because its members do not have standing as taxpayers to sue in
their own right. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441.
<P>
Accordingly, both the individuals and the two associations lack
standing to challenge the alleged illegality of the Governor's
activities. The appeal is DISMISSED.
<P>
FN* The Honorable H. Dale Cook, Chief Judge, United States District
Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, sitting by designation.
<P>
FN1. The Supreme Court has permitted federal taxpayer standing
when plaintiffs challenge that the administration of congressional
grants violates the Establishment Clause. See Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 744, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2343, 49 L.Ed.2d
179 (1976); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 735-36, 93 S.Ct. 2868,
2870-71, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973); Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S.
672, 676, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 2094, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971).
<P>
FN2. The dissent in Hoohuli argued that the taxpayers lacked standing
because they did not demonstrate how the Hawaiian plan increases
the taxes they pay. Id. at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting). The
dissent noted that if the taxpayers had shown a sufficient good-faith
pocketbook injury, an &quot;especially acute&quot; dual federalism
issue would arise. Id.
<P>
FN3. In Cammack v. Waihee, the Ninth Circuit found that the same
standing requirements that apply to state taxpayers also apply
to municipal taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;[W]e conclude that municipal taxpayer standing simply requires
the 'injury' of an allegedly improper expenditure of municipal
funds, and in this way mirrors our threshold for state taxpayer
standing.&quot; Id. at 770.
<P>
*1403_ FN4. Justice Kennedy garnered only four votes for the portion
of the opinion that deals with state taxpayer standing. See ASARCO,
109 S.Ct. at 2053 (Brennan, J., concurring). Because Justice Brennan
believed that it was unnecessary to address the state taxpayer
standing issue, he did not concur in this part of Justice Kennedy's
decision. Justice O'Connor did not take part in the decision.
<P>
FN5. In ASARCO, the Court explained why the plaintiff-taxpayers
lacked standing:
<P>
[The taxpayers] have simply asserted that the Arizona statute
governing mineral leases has &quot;deprived the school trust funds
of millions of dollars thereby resulting in unnecessarily higher
taxes.&quot; Complaint, p III. Even if the first part of that
assertion were correct, however, it is pure speculation whether
the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for [the taxpayers].

<P>
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge, STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS.
<P>
STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:
<P>
While attending college, plaintiffs Ernest A. Tuckett III and
William Demps, Jr. also worked as &quot;testers&quot; for the
Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington. In December 1990,
both Tuckett and Demps, who are black, were paired with white
testers also employed by the Council. On successive days, the
two pairs of testers--equipped with fake credentials intended
to be comparable--sought employment referrals from BMC Marketing
Corporation, which runs an employment agency in the District of
Columbia. Both times the white tester received a referral and
the black tester did not; indeed, BMC allegedly refused even to
accept an application from one of the two black testers. On the
basis of these tests, the Council and the two black testers sued
BMC in federal district court, alleging that BMC has &quot;a pattern,
practice and policy of employment discrimination on the basis
of race&quot;. The plaintiffs asserted claims under two different
federal statutes--42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e--and
one local statute. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief
as well as damages of various sorts.
<P>
BMC moved to dismiss the complaint for want of standing. The district
court denied the motion but granted BMC leave to take an interlocutory
appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), 829 F.Supp. 402; we permitted
the appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part. While the Fair
Employment Council can maintain a portion of its suit, the individual
testers cannot.
<P>
I. The Individual Testers
<P>
A. Federal Claims
<P>
Neither of the federal statutes that they invoke gives the tester
plaintiffs a cause of action for damages, and they lack standing
to seek the other forms of relief requested.
<P>
1. Claims for Damages
<P>
a. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981
<P>
Section 1981 gives all citizens of the United States &quot;the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts
... as is enjoyed by white citizens&quot;, language that the Supreme
Court has interpreted to prohibit not only racially discriminatory
government interference with private contracting but also purely
private discrimination in contracts. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.
160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171-75, 109 S.Ct. 2363,
2369-72, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). The testers assert that BMC violated
their rights under this statute in two distinct ways: it deprived
them of the opportunity to enter into contracts with BMC for employment
referrals, and it deprived them of the opportunity to enter into
employment contracts on referral by BMC. In the context of this
case, however, neither assertion states a valid claim under Sec.
1981.
<P>
As for the first assertion, BMC denies that it enters into contracts
with the people who seek referrals from it. The plaintiffs respond
that this argument assumes factual matters that should be dealt
with in further proceedings. But even if BMC sometimes does enter
into contracts with job-seekers, the testers here made conscious
and material *1271 misrepresentations of fact by deceiving BMC
about their intentions and by presenting BMC with fictitious credentials.
Any resulting contracts between the tester plaintiffs and BMC
would have been voidable at BMC's option, as the plaintiffs appear
to recognize. See, e.g., Rest. (2d) of Contracts Sec. 164(1) (1981).
Even on the plaintiffs' argument, then, BMC did not deny the testers
the opportunity to enter into a contract that they could have
enforced.
<P>
Certainly the loss of the opportunity to enter into a void contract--i.e.,
a contract that neither party can enforce--is not an injury
<P>
cognizable under Sec. 1981, for a void contract is a legal nullity.
From the perspective of the party who obtains a contract through
misrepresentations, however, it is generally worse for the contract
to be voidable than for it to be void; in the absence of any kind
of ratification, a voidable contract simply gives the other party
an option. In any event, the rule that contracts obtained through
misrepresentations are merely voidable rather than void seems
designed entirely to protect the target of the misrepresentations.
We conclude, therefore, that the loss of the opportunity to enter
into a contract voidable at the other party's will is not cognizable
under Sec. 1981. Cf., e.g., Kawitt v. United States, 842 F.2d
951, 953 (7th Cir.1988) (job obtained by material misrepresentation
is not a property right on which constitutional suit may be founded).
<P>
The plaintiffs' second assertion fails because the testers concededly
had no interest in securing a job through BMC. Indeed, they had
promised the Council to refuse any offer of employment that they
received in conjunction with their testing activities. See Plaintiffs'
Rule 108(h) Statement of Genuine Factual Issues (Sept. 18, 1992)
at 17; Defendant Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss
and/or for Summary Judgment (June 23, 1992) tab 14 at 17. In depositions,
both of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they would have rejected
any job offer obtained through a referral from BMC. Plaintiffs'
Statement tab 20 at 92 (Tuckett); Snelling's Motion tab 16 at
233-34 (Demps). At most, then, BMC deprived the tester plaintiffs
of the opportunity to refuse to enter into an employment contract
with BMC's clients. This too is not an injury cognizable under
Sec. 1981.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages under Sec. 1981 arguably conflicts with decisions of the
Third and Eleventh Circuits, but the analysis in those decisions
is not directly on point. In Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership
Ass'n, 559 F.2d 894 (3d Cir.1977), overruled on other grounds
by Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1985), aff'd,
482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987), the Third
Circuit held that fair-housing testers had standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1982, a parallel provision that guarantees
all citizens &quot;the same right, in every State and Territory,
as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof&quot; to engage in a variety
of transactions involving property. Meyers, however, addressed
exclusively the proposition that a plaintiff's standing is not
defeated by the fact that he subjected himself to legal injury
solely for the purpose of determining whether his rights would
be violated, with the intent to bring suit if they were. Cf.,
e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1219-20,
18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 79 S.Ct.
178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (per curiam). Meyers did not address
whether the testers had in fact suffered any legal injury within
the meaning of Secs. 1981 or 1982. At most, it simply assumed
that the testers had a cause of action under those provisions,
and it may not have considered the issue at all. See Meyers, 559
F.2d at 898.
<P>
Watts v. Boyd Properties, 758 F.2d 1482 (11th Cir.1985), is similarly
unpersuasive. Though the Eleventh Circuit did indicate that fair-housing
testers have a cause of action under Sec. 1982 (and hence, presumably,
under Sec. 1981), it rested this view chiefly on Meyers.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs lack a cause of action
under Sec. 1981 is perfectly consistent with Havens Realty Corp.
v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982),
which held that black fair-housing testers had standing to sue
over alleged violations of Sec. 804(d) of the Fair Housing Act
of 1968. There, Congress had *1272 clearly conferred a cause of
action on the testers; Sec. 804(d) made it unlawful &quot;[t]o
represent to any person because of race ... that any dwelling
is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling
is in fact so available&quot;, and Sec. 812 provided that &quot;[t]he
rights granted by section[ ] ... 804 ... may be enforced by civil
actions in appropriate United States district courts&quot;. See42
U.S.C. Secs. 3604(d), 3612(a). Under these statutory provisions,
it did not matter that the testers merely posed as potential renters
or purchasers; regardless of their intentions, the statute gave
them &quot;an enforceable right to truthfulinformation concerning
the availability of housing&quot;. Havens, 455 U.S.
<P>
at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121 (emphasis added). The question for
theHavens Court, then, was simply whether Congress could constitutionally
confer such a cause of action--i.e., whether the denial of truthful
information to testers caused them any &quot;injury in fact&quot;.
The Court's answer to this constitutional question has no bearing
on the proper interpretation of Sec. 1981.
<P>
b. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(b)
<P>
The tester plaintiffs also sought damages under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII declares that &quot;[i]t shall
be an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to
fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate
against, any individual because of his race&quot;. 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-2(b). After exhausting certain administrative remedies (as
the plaintiffs have done), &quot;a person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by any such practice may sue the offending employment agency in
court. Id. Sec. 2000e-5(b), (c), (f)(1). This statutory scheme
is much more analogous than Sec. 1981 to the provisions of the
Fair Housing Act that were at issue in Havens. (FN1) For our purposes,
however, the available remedies are critically different.
<P>
Had the tester plaintiff in Havens proved her claims, the district
court could have awarded her damages. See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3612(b);
cf. United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 932-33 (7th Cir.1992).
At the time of the alleged discrimination against the testers
here, however, only equitable remedies were available under Title
VII. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g); see also United States v. Burke,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873-74, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992)
(contrasting &quot;the circumscribed remedies available under
Title VII&quot; with the remedies available under the Fair Housing
Act). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the remedies available
under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981a, but the new remedial
provisions cannot be applied to conduct occurring before the enactment
of the 1991 statute. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, --- U.S. ----,
114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).
<P>
2. Claims for Prospective Relief
<P>
Since the tester plaintiffs have no cause of action for damages
under either Sec. 1981 or Title VII, their federal claims reduce
to their request for injunctive or declaratory relief. Yet under
City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75
L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), they lack standing to seek such prospective
relief, for they have not made sufficient allegations that they
are threatened with any future illegality.
<P>
The plaintiff in Lyons alleged that Los Angeles police, without
provocation, had subjected him to a chokehold that had knocked
him unconscious and injured his larynx. In addition to damages,
he sought an injunction barring the police from applying such
chokeholds in the future. But the Supreme Court held that he had
no standing to seek injunctive relief. Despite his allegations
of past injury, his standing to seek the injunction &quot;depended
on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use
of the chokeholds by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct.
at 1667 (emphasis added). While conceding the possibility that
&quot;there will be certain instances *1273 in which strangleholds
will be illegally applied and injury ... unconstitutionally inflicted
upon the victim&quot;, the Court thought it &quot;no more than
speculation to assert ... that Lyons himself will again be involved
in one of those unfortunate instances&quot;. Id. at 108, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668. In short, while Lyons could maintain a suit for damages,
he could not maintain his suit for an injunction because he &quot;has
made no showing that he is realistically threatened by a repetition
of his experience&quot;. Id. at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The same
rationale, we have observed, would also have kept him from bringing
a suit for declaratory relief. Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902,
911 (D.C.Cir.1987); see also, e.g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S.
103, 108-10, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959-61, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); City
of Houston v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Dev't, 24 F.3d
1421, 1429 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1994).
<P>
Here, the tester plaintiffs made several different references
to future injury in their complaint. In general, however, these
future injuries spring entirely from BMC's past conduct. See,
e.g., Second Amended Complaint p 44 (suggesting that testers will
continue to feel embarrassment and humiliation over their treatment
during the tests); id. p 7. To pursue an injunction or a declaratory
judgment, the tester plaintiffs must allege a likelihood of future
violations of their rights by BMC, not simply future effects from
past violations. Lyons is directly on point, for the Court there
denied standing despite the plaintiff's allegation that he continued
to fear that he would suffer a fatal chokehold in a future encounter
with the police. &quot;The emotional consequences of a prior act&quot;,
the Court observed, &quot;simply are not a sufficient basis for
an injunction absent a real and immediate threat of future injury
by the defendant.&quot; Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n. 8, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668 n. 8.
<P>
Only once in their complaint do the tester plaintiffs even come
close to alleging that they will suffer any future illegality
at BMC's hands. In their Sec. 1981 count (though not in their
Title VII count), they assert that &quot;[u]nless restrained by
this Court, defendants will continue to deny, on the basis of
race, said plaintiffs and third parties who may be unaware of
the defendants' discriminatory conduct[ ] the right to make and
enforce contracts for employment.&quot; Second Amended Complaint
p 50. The reference to third parties, of course, does not help
the tester plaintiffs establish standing; to satisfy the requirements
of Article III, they must allege that they themselves are likely
to suffer future injury. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108-09, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668-69. Nonetheless, the quoted passage constitutes the only
conceivable support for the plaintiffs' argument that the complaint
contains the requisite claims of future injuries, which they sort
into two distinct types.
<P>
First, the plaintiffs assert standing on the basis of &quot;BMC's
continuing failure to refer Mr. Demps or Mr. Tuckett for employment
on account of their race&quot;. Appellees' Brief at 36. This allegation,
however, does the tester plaintiffs no good; as we explained above,
see supra part I.A.1.a., BMC's refusal to act on the testers'
applications does not violate Sec. 1981. And even if we import
the same allegation into the plaintiffs' Title VII count, the
facts as alleged by the plaintiffs would not make out a continuing
violation of Title VII either. The tester plaintiffs sought referrals
from BMC solely on the basis of their fictitious credentials and
their misrepresentations about their desire for jobs. Now that
BMC is aware of the deception, it surely has no duty to continue
to consider the testers for employment referrals.
<P>
The plaintiffs also claim that their complaint, fairly read, raises
&quot;the possibility that as people entering the job market or
as testers they will in the future seek job referrals from BMC&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 36. But nowhere does the complaint assert
that the tester plaintiffs are likely ever to return to BMC seeking
employment referrals, let alone that they will do so at any point
&quot;in the reasonably near future&quot;. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 108, 103 S.Ct. at 1668-69; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2138, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)
(rejecting standing for want of sufficiently &quot;imminent&quot;
future injury). Even now, in fact, the plaintiffs do not suggest
that there is any likelihood that the two testers will re-initiate
contact with BMC; they refer only to the &quot;possibility&quot;
of this event. That *1274 possibility seems remote indeed. Their
usefulness as testers is minimal because they are now known to
BMC, and indeed it does not appear from the materials before us
that they are still employed as testers at all. Their adversarial
relationship with BMC, moreover, as well as their established
record as deceivers, make it highly implausible that they would
ever return as bona fide job seekers. Cf.United Transp. Union
v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 913 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1989) (court may discredit
incredible allegations).
<P>
The district court overlooked these problems on the theory that
the plaintiffs themselves control whether they re-initiate contact
with BMC. Mem.Op. at 7. But this fact does not excuse the plaintiffs
from alleging that they plan to do so. To the contrary, the Supreme
Court has categorically rejected the proposition that a plaintiff
seeking prospective relief need assert a threat of imminent future
injury &quot;only when the alleged harm depends upon 'the affirmative
actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control' &quot;.
See Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at
2139 n. 2.
<P>
In any event, the plaintiffs simply do not control whether they
will suffer any future injury, for they do not control whether
BMC would discriminate against them in any future encounter. Suppose
we could assume that the tester plaintiffs are likely to return
to BMC in the reasonably near future. Indeed, for the sake of
their Sec. 1981 claim (and possibly even their Title VII claim,
see supra at 6 n. 1), suppose we could assume that they will do
so as bona fide candidates for employment rather than as testers.
They would still appear to be in much the same position as the
plaintiff in Lyons: while he presumably could have initiated another
encounter with the Los Angeles police, he could not control whether
he would be subjected to a second illegal chokehold.
<P>
In Lyons, the Supreme Court stated that unless the plaintiff could
allege that Los Angeles ordered or authorized its police officers
to apply unprovoked chokeholds, he could &quot;establish an actual
controversy in this case&quot; only by &quot;mak[ing] the incredible
assertion ... that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke
any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter&quot;.
Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. at 1667. This formulation
may be hyperbolic; indeed, Lyons itself said that the plaintiff's
standing to seek an injunction &quot;depended on whether he was
likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds
by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct. at 1667 (emphasis
added); see also International Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied
Craftsmen v. Meese, 761 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C.Cir.1985) (adopting
&quot;fairly probable&quot; as standard). But see Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 1724-25, 109 L.Ed.2d
135 (1990) (indicating that plaintiff whose standing rests on
threat of future injury must show that this injury is &quot;certainly
impending&quot;); Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2,
112 S.Ct. at 2139 n. 2 (same); Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Espy,
23 F.3d 496, 500-01 (D.C.Cir.1994), (same). Whatever the exact
standard for judging the likelihood of future injury, however,
the tester plaintiffs here have said nothing to indicate that
future violation of their rights is even remotely probable. Indeed,
besides its oblique statement that BMC's treatment of the testers
reflects &quot;a pattern, practice and policy of employment discrimination
on the basis of race&quot;, the complaint does not even address
the likelihood that BMC may discriminate against the individual
plaintiffs in the future.
<P>
For all these reasons, the facts as alleged in the complaint do
not come close to indicating that either tester &quot;will again
be subjected to the alleged illegality&quot;. See Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The tester plaintiffs therefore lack
standing to seek prospective relief.
<P>
B. The Possibility of Amendment
<P>
As a fallback position, the plaintiffs claim that &quot;the appropriate
course is to remand to the District Court to permit plaintiffs
an opportunity to amend and supplement their Complaint&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 37 n. 26. In Havens, which involved a challenge
to a realty company's alleged practice of steering white customers
to white areas and black customers to black areas, the Supreme
Court followed this course with respect to two plaintiffs who
alleged that the company's actions *1275 had deprived them of
the benefits of living in an integrated community. Though the
complaint simply stated that these plaintiffs were &quot;residents
of the City of Richmond or Henrico County&quot;, the Court said
they would have standing only if they lived in neighborhoods where
the company's actions had &quot;an appreciable effect&quot;. See
Havens, 455 U.S. at 376-77, 102 S.Ct. at 1122-24. Because the
complaint was not sufficiently specific about where they lived,
it was &quot;impossible to say&quot; whether its factual allegations,
if proved, would demonstrate the requisite injury. Id. at 378,
102 S.Ct. at 1124. Citing Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court therefore remanded with instructions for
the district court to give the plaintiffs &quot;an opportunity
to make more definite the allegations of the complaint&quot;.
Id.
<P>
The Court's later decisions clarify the reasoning behind this
disposition.
<P>
Havens came to the Court on the defendant's motion to dismiss
the case on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(b). Though courts
addressing such motions usually must &quot;presume[ ] that general
allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to
support the claim&quot;, Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed'n, 497
U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3189, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), Havens
establishes that such a presumption is unwarranted when the allegations
are too general. Even then, however, the contrary presumption
may be inappropriate; faced with such allegations, courts ruling
on a Rule 12(b) motion often should not assume that the claim
is invalid without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to make
more specific claims. (FN2)
<P>
The case before us is quite different. We do not confront a complaint
whose allegations are so general that we cannot tell whether,
if proved, they would demonstrate injury in fact. To the contrary,
the allegations plainly are not sufficient to support standing,
for they simply do not deal with the likelihood of any future
injury to the plaintiff testers. What is necessary, then, is not
the &quot;more definite statement&quot; contemplated by Rule 12(e),
but an amendment adding allegations that the present complaint
does not even touch upon. Rule 15(a) makes clear that the plaintiffs
have no automatic right to add those allegations.
<P>
On the other hand, district courts do have the discretion to permit
such amendments when considering a motion to dismiss for want
of standing. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197,
2206-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); see also, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors
v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 113 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 1601,
1614 n. 25, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.
727, 736 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1367 n. 8, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972);
Newark Branch, NAACP v. Town of Harrison, 907 F.2d 1408, 1416-17
(3d Cir.1990). Here, the district court did not consider whether
to exercise this discretion, because it erroneously believed that
no amendment was necessary. Accordingly, while we vacate the district
court's denial of BMC's motion to dismiss the individual testers'
suit, we do not order it to grant that motion; instead, we remand
the case for the district court to exercise its sound discretion
over whether to permit amendment. We see no reason why plaintiffs
who win in the district court should automatically be in a worse
position than plaintiffs whose allegations of standing have been
rightly found defective by the district court.
<P>
Of course, a plaintiff's successful effort to persuade a trial
court to take an erroneous view of the law may yield different
equities from those prevailing in the absence of such an effort.
In some circumstances, it might well be an abuse of discretion
for the district court to permit plaintiffs to add new allegations
to a complaint after their adversaries have been forced to spend
substantial time and effort litigating the adequacy of the old
allegations. Cf. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 897,
110 S.Ct. at 3193 (&quot;[A] *1276 litigant's failure to buttress
its position because of confidence in the strength of that position
is always indulged at the litigant's own risk.&quot;). But in
any event, the matter of amendment is in the first instance for
the district court.
<P>
C. Pendent Claims under District of Columbia Law
<P>
The tester plaintiffs have also asserted a cause of action under
the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act. That statute contains
a provision similar to Sec. 2000e-2(b), see D.C.Code Sec. 1-2512(a)(2),
and it goes further than the original Title VII by authorizing
suits for damages as well as for equitable relief, see id. Sec.
1-2556. But the testers were able to bring their claim under this
statute to federal court only because it was pendent to their
federal claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(a). As a result, even
if the plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages under D.C.
law, it will be within the district court's discretion whether
or not to dismiss this claim if it dismisses both their federal
claims. See id. Sec. 1367(c)(3); cf. Clifton Terrace Assocs. v.
United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d 714, 723 (D.C.Cir.1991).
<P>
II. The Fair Employment Council
<P>
The other plaintiff in this action, the Fair Employment Council
of Greater Washington, fares better under our analysis. The Council
does not claim standing on behalf of any members; in fact, it
is not a membership organization. Cf. Hunt v. Washington State
Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S.
<P>
333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). It claims
instead that BMC's allegedly discriminatory actions have caused
it injury in its own right.
<P>
We agree that the Council has alleged &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III. And, though
the Council is suing BMC over alleged violations of statutory
rights enjoyed by third parties, we conclude that Congress did
give the Council a cause of action under Title VII. We also conclude,
however, that the Council has no cause of action under Sec. 1981.
<P>
A. Article III Standing
<P>
Like the fair-housing organization that was one of the plaintiffs
in Havens, the Council has a broad goal of promoting equal opportunity
independent of merely seeking more enforcement of the civil rights
laws. Second Amended Complaint p 5. Its testing program is but
one means toward this goal; the Council also conducts &quot;community
outreach and public education, counseling, and research projects&quot;.
Declaration of Charles W. Jackson p 8 (Sept. 18, 1992). The complaint
alleges that BMC's discriminatory actions have interfered with
these efforts and programs and have also required the Council
to expend resources to counteract BMC's alleged discrimination.
Second Amended Complaint pp 45, 58, 60.
<P>
These allegations closely track the claims that the Supreme Court
found sufficient in Havens. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct.
at 1124-25. Fairly read, they indicate that BMC's alleged pattern
of discrimination--evidenced by the alleged treatment of the testers--has
made the Council's overall task more difficult. Discrimination
by BMC, for instance, might increase the number of people in need
of counseling; similarly, to the extent that BMC's actions have
made it harder for minorities to find jobs in greater Washington,
they may have reduced the effectiveness of any given level of
outreach efforts. If discriminatory actions taken by BMC have
&quot;perceptibly impaired&quot; the Council's programs, &quot;there
can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in
fact&quot;. Id.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, however, we explicitly reject the
Council's suggestion that the mere expense of testing BMC constitutes
&quot;injury in fact&quot; fairly traceable to BMC's conduct.
The diversion of resources to testing might well harm the Council's
other programs, for money spent on testing is money that is not
spent on other things. But this particular harm is self-inflicted;
it results not from any actions taken by BMC, but rather from
the Council's own budgetary choices. Indeed, it is not really
a harm at all; assuming that BMC's actions did not have any other
effect on the Council's programs independent of its efforts to
increase legal pressure *1277 on possible open housing violators,
the Council and its programs would have been totally unaffected
if it had simply refrained from making the re-allocation. One
can hardly say that BMC has injured the Council merely because
the Council has decided that its money would be better spent by
testing BMC than by counseling or researching. (FN3)
<P>
We disagree with the Seventh Circuit that Havens would support
such a purely self-referential injury. In Village of Bellwood
v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th Cir.1990), the court concluded
that even when a fair-housing organization's other activities
had not been impaired by the defendant's discriminatory practices,
&quot;the only injury which need be shown ... is deflection of
the agency's time and money from counseling to legal efforts directed
against discrimination.&quot; Id. at 1526. By this logic, the
time and money that plaintiffs spend in bringing suit against
a defendant would itself constitute a sufficient &quot;injury
in fact&quot;, a circular position that would effectively abolish
the requirement altogether. Indeed, an organization devoted exclusively
to advancing more rigorous enforcement of selected laws could
secure standing simply by showing that one alleged illegality
had &quot;deflected&quot; it from pursuit of another, contrary
to such decisions as Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop
the War, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Havens
did not so hold. The Court there did not base standing on the
diversion of resources from one program to another, but rather
on the alleged injury that the defendants' actions themselves
had inflicted upon the organization's programs. To be sure, the
Court did mention the &quot;drain on the organization's resources&quot;.
Yet this drain apparently sprang from the organization's need
to &quot;counteract&quot; the defendants' assertedly illegal practices,
and thus was simply another manifestation of the injury that those
practices had inflicted upon &quot;the organization's noneconomic
interest in encouraging open housing&quot;, an interest that is
quite intelligible apart from the allied efforts at increasing
legal pressure on civil-rights violators. See Havens, 455 U.S.
at 379 &amp; n. 20, 102 S.Ct. at 1124 &amp; n. 20; cf. Spann v.
Colonial Village, 899 F.2d 24, 27-29 (D.C.Cir.1990) (finding standing
because in order to offset defendant's allegedly discriminatory
advertisements, plaintiff organization had to spend more on its
educational and counseling efforts).
<P>
A corollary of our conclusion is that the Council's standing stems
from BMC's actions against bona fide employment candidates, not
from BMC's actions against the testers. The Council has adequately
alleged that BMC has a pattern or practice of discrimination,
and its treatment of the testers may be some evidence of such
a pattern. Any harm to the Council's programs, however, flows
from BMC's refusal to refer genuine job-seekers for employment.
As this case proceeds, the Council will have to provide support
for its claim that BMC's alleged discrimination has &quot;perceptibly
impaired&quot; its programs.
<P>
B. Cause of Action
<P>
Though the Council has adequately alleged an &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to meet the requirements of Article III, this does
not necessarily mean that Congress has conferred a cause of action
upon it. BMC has done nothing to impair the Council's own right
to make contracts, nor is the Council even capable of seeking
an employment referral. Instead, the Council's asserted injuries
flow from BMC's alleged violations of other people's rights under
Sec. 1981 and Title VII. This fact triggers concerns about an
aspect of the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing: ordinarily,
a plaintiff &quot;must assert his own legal interests, rather
than those of third parties&quot;. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608.
<P>
*1278 To phrase the principle this way, however, is to beg the
question. If Congress has given the Council a cause of action
to redress the injuries that it is suffering as a result of BMC's
alleged discrimination against candidates for referrals, then
the Council is indeed suing to protect its own &quot;legal interests&quot;.
Cf., e.g., Smith v. City of Cleveland Heights, 760 F.2d 720, 724
(6th Cir.1985). A more precise statement of the principle, then,
is that a statute ordinarily will not be interpreted to confer
causes of action upon people whose only injuries derive from the
violation of others' rights under the statute.
<P>
When the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing to raise statutory
claims are understood in this way--as a set of presumptions that
courts use in determining whether the statutes in question confer
a cause of action upon the plaintiff, see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 500-01, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 861 F.2d 277, 283 (D.C.Cir.1988)--the &quot;prudential&quot;
label seems a misnomer. These &quot;prudential&quot; rules are
simply canons of statutory interpretation, and Congress is free
to override the normal presumptions. In Havens, for instance,
the Supreme Court noted that Congress intended standing to sue
under Sec. 812 of the Fair Housing Act to extend to the full reach
permitted by the Constitution, and concluded that &quot;the courts
accordingly lack the authority to create prudential barriers to
standing in suits brought under that section&quot;. Havens, 455
U.S. at 372, 102 S.Ct. at 1120; accord Warth, 422 U.S. at 501,
95 S.Ct. at 2206-07. Statutes of this sort confer a cause of action
upon everyone who meets the Article III requirements--that is,
anyone &quot;genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone's
... rights&quot; under the statute. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 103 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 1609 n. 9.
<P>
Our case law establishes that Title VII is such a statute. Congress
specifically permitted any &quot;person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by an unlawful employment practice to file suit (after exhausting
certain other potential avenues of relief). See 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-5(f)(1). This language, we have held, opens the courts to
&quot;anyone who satisfies the constitutional requirements&quot;.
Gray v. Greyhound Lines, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C.Cir.1976); see
also Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205,
209, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-67, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972) (citing with
approval the Third Circuit's decision to the same effect). Accordingly,
if the Council can back up its allegations of Article III standing
with actual proof, it has a cause of action under Title VII.
<P>
Section 1981 is a different matter. A footnote in Gray indicated
that there too standing extended to the full extent permissible
under Article III. Gray, 545 F.2d at 176 n. 18. This conclusion,
however, rested on an unsustainable assumption that the Supreme
Court, in citing a snippet of Title VII's legislative history
to the effect that the remedies available under Title VII were
&quot;co-extensive&quot; with an individual's right to sue under
Sec. 1981, meant that Congress had identically resolved prudential
standing issues under the two statutes. See Johnson v. Railway
Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1719-20, 44
L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In fact, as the Supreme Court made clear,
the committee's statement that Title VII and Sec. 1981 were &quot;co-extensive&quot;
simply meant that the two statutes co-existed, with the result
that Title VII did not pre-empt whatever rights an individual
might enjoy under Sec. 1981. Id.
<P>
Moreover, Gray 's view of Sec. 1981 flatly conflicts with the
Supreme Court's holding in Warth v. Seldin. There, an organization
whose members included residents of the town of Penfield, New
York, complained that the town's zoning ordinance excluded people
of low and moderate income in violation of those people's rights
under Sec. 1981. This exclusion, in turn, injured the organization's
members by depriving them of the benefits of living in an integrated
community. Such an injury satisfies the constitutional requirements,
and the Court accordingly has recognized it as a basis for standing
in suits under the Fair Housing Act (which confers standing to
the full extent permitted by Article III). See Trafficante, 409
U.S. at 208-10, 93 S.Ct. at 366-67. In Warth, however, the Court
held that Sec. 1981 was critically different *1279 from the Fair
Housing Act in this respect. Invoking the &quot;prudential&quot;
rule against allowing litigants &quot;to raise putative rights
of third parties&quot;, it accordingly barred the organization's
suit. Warth, 422 U.S. at 512-14, 93 S.Ct. at 2212-13.
<P>
As one would expect, then, other circuits--including our own--have
rejected Gray 's view of Sec. 1981. In Mackey v. Nationwide Insurance
Companies, 724 F.2d 419 (4th Cir.1984), an insurance agent attempted
to challenge his former employer's alleged practice of refusing
to underwrite risks in predominantly black neighborhoods. The
agent claimed that this practice had forced him to forgo the money
that he could have earned by selling policies in these areas.
But while Congress could constitutionally have conferred a cause
of action upon the agent to redress this &quot;injury in fact&quot;,
the court held that Sec. 1981 did not do so. Distinguishing Sec.
1981 from the Fair Housing Act, the court decided that standing
under Sec. 1981 is restricted to &quot;the direct victims of the
alleged discriminatory practice&quot;, at least as long as there
is no impediment to suits by those victims. Id. at 422.
<P>
We too have now explicitly embraced Mackey rather than Gray. In
Clifton Terrace Associates v. United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d
714 (D.C.Cir.1991), the owner of a low-income housing complex
sued the Otis Elevator Company and its corporate parent for refusing
to negotiate a service contract for the elevators in the complex,
allegedly because the residents of the complex were overwhelmingly
black. The owner plainly had suffered &quot;injury in fact&quot;
as a result of this refusal, for its elevators were deteriorating;
indeed, the city government had taken action against it for violating
its duties as a landlord. Accordingly, we dealt with the owner's
Fair Housing Act claims on the merits. But we accorded a different
treatment to the owner's claims under Sec. 1981. Concluding that
&quot;the direct victims of the alleged discrimination are the
residents of Clifton Terrace&quot; rather than the owner, we invoked
Mackey to hold that the owner could not sue under Sec. 1981. Id.
at 721. (FN4) Accordingly, our law is now in accord with that
of the Supreme Court and other circuits in concluding that Sec.
1981 does not confer a cause of action on persons whose injuries
derive only from the violation of others' rights.
<P>
In arguing that the &quot;prudential&quot; barriers to standing
nonetheless do not preclude its particular suit, the Council cites
Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water District, 601 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1979).
Yet that case does not get it very far. Des Vergnes held simply
that Sec. 1981 confers an implied right of action &quot;against
any other person who, with a racially discriminatory intent, interferes
with [the plaintiff's] right to make contracts with nonwhites&quot;;
by the same token, the statute confers an implied right of action
&quot;against any other person who, with a racially discriminatory
intent, injures [the plaintiff] because he made contracts with
nonwhites&quot;. Id. at 14; see also Winston v. Lear-Siegler,
Inc., 558 F.2d 1266, 1270 (6th Cir.1977); DeMatteis v. Eastman
Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 312, modified, 520 F.2d 409 (2d Cir.1975);
cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct.
400, 404-05, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (reaching parallel result under
Sec. 1982). Implicit *1280 in Sec. 1981, these cases declare,
is a cause of action protecting people from private retaliation
for refusing to violate other people's rights under Sec. 1981,
or for exercising their own Sec. 1981 rights. The present case
simply does not implicate this principle.
<P>
The normal presumption against reading a statute to authorize
&quot;derivative&quot; causes of action--that is, causes of action
to redress injuries that derive entirely from the violation of
someone else's rights under the statute--is subject to only one
exception that is even arguably relevant here. Courts sometimes
infer that the legislature intended to authorize such causes of
action when, in their absence, no one would be able to assert
the statutory rights that the legislature created. Because of
this inference, a litigant might have a cause of action even though
his injuries flow from the violation of other people's statutory
rights, at least if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) the litigant's interests are aligned with the other people's
interests, and (2) the other people are unable to bring suit in
their own right. See, e.g., Canfield Aviation v. National Transp.
Safety Bd., 854 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir.1988); Flittie v. Solem,
827 F.2d 276, 280 (8th Cir.1987); In re Merrill Lynch Relocation
Management, Inc., 812 F.2d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.1987).
<P>
But even assuming that the Council's interests are aligned with
those of the direct victims of BMC's alleged discrimination, the
obstacles to suit by those victims are not serious enough to warrant
the inference that Sec. 1981 confers a cause of action upon the
Council. To be sure, the people to whom BMC denies employment
referrals may not necessarily know why their applications were
unsuccessful, and so the possible victims of BMC's alleged discrimination
may not always know who they are. But the Council itself could
remedy much of the problem simply by publicizing the results of
its tests and offering litigation assistance to people who suspect
(on the basis of this new information) that BMC has discriminated
against them. In the present case, as in Warth v. Seldin, &quot;there
is no indication that [direct victims of discrimination by BMC]
are disabled from asserting their own right in a proper case.&quot;
Warth, 422 U.S. at 510, 95 S.Ct. at 2211. Certainly they do not
face anything like the practical obstacles confronting people
excluded from a jury for discriminatory reasons, whose rights
the Court has allowed a criminal defendant to assert. See Powers
v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 414-15, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1372-73, 113 L.Ed.2d
411 (1991) (describing the &quot;daunting&quot; barriers to suit
by an excluded juror); cf. Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d
1409, 1416 (4th Cir.1983) (hypothesizing preemptive discrimination
that could never be identified with any individual victims).
<P>
The Third Circuit has perceived &quot;seemingly inconsistent strains&quot;
in the Supreme Court's treatment of whether &quot;the 'obstacle'
factor&quot; is an essential prerequisite to third-party standing,
Amato v. Wilentz, 952 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir.1991), and has resorted
to a &quot;more flexible balancing approach&quot; in an effort
to make sense of the Court's jurisprudence. Id. at 749-50 &amp;
n. 8. But we think the cases can in fact be reconciled.
<P>
Apart from cases involving &quot;the 'obstacle' factor&quot;,
the Court generally has
<P>
allowed a litigant to assert the rights of a third party &quot;only
when the third party's rights protect that party's relationship
with the litigant&quot;. Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809
F.2d 794, 809 (D.C.Cir.1987). (FN5) In the lion's share of these
cases, the litigant seeks to challenge direct restrictions on
its own activities on the ground that enforcement of the restrictions
against it would dilute or abrogate the rights of third parties.
As the Court has summed up its jurisprudence, &quot;When ... enforcement
of a restriction against the litigant prevents a *1281. third
party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically
a contractual relationship), to which relationship the third party
has a legal entitlement (typically a constitutional entitlement),
third-party standing has been held to exist.&quot; United States
Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720, 110 S.Ct. 1428,
1431, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); see also Warth, 422 U.S. at 510,
95 S.Ct. at 2211. For example, the Court has allowed beer vendors
to assert the equal-protection rights of their potential customers
in challenging a prohibition on the sale of beer to young males,
Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 195, 97 S.Ct. 451, 455, 50 L.Ed.2d
397 (1976); distributors of contraceptive devices to assert the
privacy rights of contraceptive purchasers in challenging restrictions
on the distributors, Carey v. Population Servs. International,
431 U.S. 678, 682-84, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2014-16, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977);
and booksellers to assert the First Amendment rights of bookbuyers
in challenging the prohibition of certain commercial displays,
Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 392-93,
108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988). Less frequently,
the Court has allowed litigants to assert third parties' rights
in challenging restrictions that do not operate directly on the
litigants themselves, but that nonetheless allegedly disrupt a
special relationship--protected by the rights in question--between
the litigants and the third parties. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society
of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (allowing
military academy and parochial school to assert constitutional
rights of students and parents in challenging state law requiring
parents to send their children to government school); see also
Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617,
623-24 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 2651-52 n. 3, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989)
(allowing lawyers to challenge federal forfeiture laws that allegedly
violate their clients' Sixth Amendment right to counsel); Singleton
v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-18 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2873-76
&amp; n. 7, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (plurality opinion) (allowing
abortion-performing doctors to complain that restrictions on Medicaid
payments for abortion violate the constitutional rights of women
seeking abortions). See generally National Cottonseed Products
Ass'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 489-92 &amp; n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1987).
<P>
Whatever the precise limits of these cases, they offer no help
to the Council. The Council certainly faces no direct restriction
on its own activities, and the Sec. 1981 rights of people who
seek referrals from BMC are unrelated to any special relationship
between those people and the Council. Under Warth v. Seldin, the
Council therefore cannot bring suit to complain about the violation
of those people's Sec. 1981 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 514
n. 22, 95 S.Ct. at 2213 n. 22.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
To sum up, the Council lacks a cause of action under Sec. 1981.
It can proceed with its Title VII claim, but it has a cause of
action only to the extent that the effects of BMC's discrimination
have perceptibly impaired its programs. As for the individual
testers, they have not stated a cause of action under Sec. 1981,
nor have they established standing to seek the only form of relief
that might be available to them under Title VII.
<P>
We remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
<P>
So ordered.
<P>
FN1. BMC still argues that people who lack a bona fide interest
in employment--such as testers--lack any cause of action under
Sec. 2000e-2(b).
<P>
The plaintiffs, supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission as amicus curiae, dispute this reading of the statute.
But because we agree with BMC's alternative argument that the
tester plaintiffs cannot recover damages under Title VII and have
no standing to seek the other relief that they request, we need
not address the issue.
<P>
FN2. The rules become less forgiving as litigation moves along.
When a court confronts a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment,
&quot;[i]t will not do to 'presume' the missing facts&quot;. National
Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 889, 110 S.Ct. at 3189. By the
same token, after the district court has held its summary-judgment
hearing, plaintiffs certainly cannot assume that the court will
permit them to supply any requisite averments through supplemental
affidavits. See id. at 894-98, 110 S.Ct. at 3191-94.
<P>
FN3. For the same reason, we reject the district court's theory
that the money that the Council spent on the second test (if not
the money that it spent on the first one) gave it &quot;a constitutionally
cognizable injury&quot; because BMC's alleged discrimination against
the first set of testers &quot;could have been a factor&quot;
in the Council's decision to run the second test. Mem.Op. at 10-11.
BMC's treatment of the first set of testers did not impair any
of the Council's programs in any way, even though the pattern
of discrimination evidenced by such tests may have done so. The
Council simply decided that its limited resources would be better
spent on testing BMC again than on testing a different agency
or on pursuing its other programs.
<P>
FN4. This conclusion, although not our embrace of Mackey, seems
to be in tension with Gersman v. Group Health Association, 931
F.2d 1565 (D.C.Cir.1991), vacated on other grounds, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 960, 117 L.Ed.2d 127 (1992), reinstated, 975 F.2d 886,
900 (D.C.Cir.1992). That case also involved a claim that the defendant
had refused to contract with one person (&quot;A &quot;) because
of a discriminatory animus against someone else (&quot;B &quot;).
But where Clifton Terrace held that A lacked standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 because any such suit would be an attempt to assert
B 's rights under the statute, Gersman took the opposite view.
Reasoning that Sec. 1981 protects the right to make contracts,
we held that B lacked standing because it was A--not B--with whom
the defendant allegedly was refusing to contract. See id. at 1567,
1569. Cf., e.g., Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111,
114 (5th Cir.1986) (recognizing cause of action under Sec. 1981
where employer allegedly fired plaintiff because her husband was
not white); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d
888, 890 (11th Cir.1986) (similar, where company allegedly refused
to hire plaintiff because of his wife's race); Fiedler v. Marumsco
Christian School, 631 F.2d 1144, 1149 (4th Cir.1980) (recognizing
cause of action under Sec. 1981 where white students alleged that
private school had expelled them for associating with blacks);
see also Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1250 (10th Cir.1992)
(holding that such causes of action under Sec. 1981 are &quot;clearly
established&quot; *1281_ FN5. The one notable exception to this
rule is inspired by First Amendment overbreadth analysis. In Secretary
of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956-57,
104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846-47, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984), for example, the
Court allowed a professional fundraiser to assert its clients'
First Amendment rights in challenging statutory limits on the
amount that charitable organizations can pay fundraisers. But
the Court specifically noted that &quot;outside the First Amendment
context&quot;, the fundraiser's standing would have been in doubt
because it had not shown that &quot;practical obstacles prevent
[the charities] from asserting rights&quot; on their own behalf.
Id. Even within the First Amendment realm, third-party standing
is by no means automatic. See, e.g., Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S.
312, 320, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 2338, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991).

<P>
OPINION
<P>
SPROUSE, Senior Circuit Judge:
<P>
George Mason University appeals from a summary judgment granted
by the district court to the IOTA XI Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity
(FN1) in its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction
seeking to nullify sanctions imposed on it by the University because
it conducted an &quot;ugly woman contest&quot; with racist and
sexist overtones. We affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
Sigma Chi has for two years held an annual &quot;Derby Days&quot;
event, planned and conducted both as entertainment and as a source
of funds for donations to charity. The &quot;ugly woman contest,&quot;
held on April 4, 1991, was one of the &quot;Derby Days&quot; events.
The Fraternity staged the contest in the cafeteria of the student
union. As part of the contest, eighteen Fraternity members were
assigned to one of six sorority teams cooperating in *388 the
events. The involved Fraternity members appeared in the contest
dressed as caricatures of different types of women, including
one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a black woman.
He was painted black and wore stringy, black hair decorated with
curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with pillows to exaggerate
a woman's breasts and buttocks. He spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.
<P>
There is no direct evidence in the record concerning the subjective
intent of the Fraternity members who conducted the contest. The
Fraternity, which later apologized to the University officials
for the presentation, conceded during the litigation that the
contest was sophomoric and offensive.
<P>
Following the contest, a number of students protested to the University
that the skit had been objectionably sexist and racist. Two hundred
forty-seven students, many of them members of the foreign or minority
student body, executed a petition, which stated: &quot;[W]e are
condemning the racist and sexist implications of this event in
which male members dressed as women. One man in particular wore
a black face, portraying a negative stereotype of black women.&quot;
<P>
On April 10, 1991, the Dean for Student Services, Kenneth Bumgarner,
discussed the situation with representatives of the objecting
students. That same day, Dean Bumgarner met with student representatives
of Sigma Chi, including the planners of and participants in the
&quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; He then held a meeting with members
of the student government and other student leaders. In this meeting,
it was agreed that Sigma Chi's behavior had created a hostile
learning environment for women and blacks, incompatible with the
University's mission.
<P>
The Dean met again with Fraternity representatives on April 18,
and the following day advised its officers of the sanctions imposed.
They included suspension from all activities for the rest of the
1991 spring semester and a two-year prohibition on all social
activities except pre-approved pledging events and pre-approved
philanthropic events with an educational purpose directly related
to gender discrimination and cultural diversity. The University's
sanctions also required Sigma Chi to plan and implement an educational
program addressing cultural differences, diversity, and the concerns
of women. A few weeks later, the University made minor modifications
to the sanctions, allowing Sigma Chi to engage in selected social
activities with the University's advance approval.
<P>
On June 5, 1991, Sigma Chi brought this action under 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 1983 (FN2) against the University and Dean Bumgarner. It
requested declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to nullify
the sanctions as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Sigma Chi moved for summary judgment on its First Amendment claims
on June 28, 1991, filing with its motions numerous affidavits
explaining the nature of the &quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; Also
submitted were large glossy photographs of the participants as
they appeared in the skits, including photographs of the Fraternity
member depicting the offensive caricature of the black woman.
<P>
In addition to the affidavit of Dean Bumgarner explaining his
meetings with student leaders, the University submitted the affidavits
of other officials, including that of University President George
W. Johnson and Vice-President Earl G. Ingram. President Johnson,
by his affidavit, presented the &quot;mission statement&quot;
of the University:
<P>
(3) George Mason University is committed to promoting a culturally
and racially diverse student body.... Education here is not limited
to the classroom.
<P>
(4) We are committed to teaching the values of equal opportunity
and equal treatment, respect for diversity, and individual dignity.
<P>
(5) Our mission also includes achieving the goals set forth in
our affirmative action *389 plan, a plan incorporating affirmative
steps designed to attract and retain minorities to this campus.
<P>
....
<P>
(7) George Mason University is a state institution of higher education
and a recipient of federal funds.
<P>
Vice President Earl G. Ingram's affidavit represented:
<P>
(6) The University's affirmative action plan is a part of an overall
state plan designed, in part, to desegregate the predominately
&quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; public institutions of
higher education in Virginia.... The behavior of the members of
Sigma Chi that led to this lawsuit was completely antithetical
to the University's mission, as expressed through its affirmative
action statement and other pertinent University policies, to create
a non-threatening, culturally diverse learning environment for
students of all races and backgrounds, and of both sexes.
<P>
(7) While the University has progressed in attracting and retaining
minority students, it cannot expect to maintain the position it
has achieved, and make further progress on affirmative action
and minority issues that it wishes to make, if behavior like that
of Sigma Chi is perpetuated on this campus.
<P>
The district court granted summary judgment to Sigma Chi on its
First
<P>
Amendment claim, 773 F.Supp. 792 (E.D.Va.1991).
<P>
II
<P>
The University urges that the district court's grant of summary
judgment was premature. It stresses that there remain factual
issues which the district court should have weighed in its conclusion.
According to the University, the Fraternity's intent in staging
the contest is crucial to the issue of whether its conduct was
expressive. The University also stresses that if given time it
could demonstrate more completely the harm the contest caused
to its educational mission. It is, of course, beyond cavil that
summary judgment should not be granted while a viable issue of
material fact remains. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment
principles require the court to find that the evidence is such
that a jury could not reasonably find for the party opposing summary
judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252,
106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Only disputes over
facts that might affect the outcome of a suit under the applicable
law preclude entry of summary judgment.
<P>
In our view, for the reasons that follow, the district court was
correct in concluding that there was no outstanding issue of material
fact.
<P>
III
<P>
We initially face the task of deciding whether Sigma Chi's &quot;ugly
woman contest&quot; is sufficiently expressive to entitle it to
First Amendment protection. From the mature advantage of looking
back, it is obvious that the performance, apart from its charitable
fund-raising features, was an exercise of teenage campus excess.
With a longer and sobering perspective brought on by both peer
and official disapproval, even the governing members of the Fraternity
recognized as much. The answer to the question of whether the
First Amendment protects the Fraternity's crude attempt at entertainment,
however, is all the more difficult because of its obvious sophomoric
nature.
<P>
A
<P>
First Amendment principles governing live entertainment are relatively
clear: short of obscenity, it is generally protected. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (nude dancing); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557-58, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1245-47,
43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (musical &quot;Hair&quot;); Berger v. Battaglia,
779 F.2d 992, 999 (4th Cir.1985) (blackface performance), cert.
denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
As the Supreme Court announced in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981), &quot;[e]ntertainment,
as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion
pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live
entertainment ... fall *390 within the First Amendment guarantee.&quot;
Id. at 65, 101 S.Ct. at 2180. Expression devoid of &quot;ideas&quot;
but with entertainment value may also be protected because &quot;[t]he
line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive.&quot;

<P>
Thus, we must determine if the skit performed by Sigma Chi comes
within the constitutionally protected rubric of entertainment.
Unquestionably, some forms of entertainment are so inherently
expressive as to fall within the First Amendment's ambit regardless
of their quality. For example, in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), the Supreme
Court flatly ruled that &quot;[m]usic, as a form of expression
and communication, is protected under the First Amendment.&quot;
Id. at 790, 109 S.Ct. at 2753. Justice Kennedy explained: Music
is one of the oldest forms of human expression. From Plato's discourse
in the Republic to the totalitarian state in our own times, rulers
have known its capacity to appeal to the intellect and to the
emotions, and have censored musical compositions to serve the
needs of the state. The Constitution prohibits any like attempts
in our own legal order.

Motion pictures, too, are included within the free speech guarantee
of the First Amendment. The Court emphasized in Joseph Burstyn,
Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952),
that &quot;[t]he importance of motion pictures as an organ of
public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed
to entertain as well as to inform.&quot; Id. at 501, 72 S.Ct.
at 780; see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S.
50, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (motion picture
theaters involve communication protected by the First Amendment,
but the state can regulate their secondary effects).
<P>
Even crude street skits come within the First Amendment's reach.
In overturning the conviction of an amateur actor for wearing
a military uniform in violation of a federal statute, the Supreme
Court discussed the statute's &quot;theatrical production&quot;
exception. (FN3) Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62,
90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558-59, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970). Responding to the
Government's argument that the amateur skit was not a &quot;theatrical
production,&quot; Justice Black, writing for the majority, stated:
<P>
It may be that the performances were crude and amateurish and
perhaps unappealing, but the same thing can be said about many
theatrical performances. We cannot believe that when Congress
wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it intended
to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally
produced plays.
<P>
Id. Although this part of the opinion related to interpretation
of the involved statute, Justice Black proceeded to declare that
an actor participating in even a crude performance enjoys the
constitutional right to freedom of speech. Id. at 63, 90 S.Ct.
at 1559.
<P>
Bearing on this dichotomy between low and high-grade entertainment
are the Supreme Court's holdings relating to nude dancing. See
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. at ----, ----, 111 S.Ct.
2456, 2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough of Mount
Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d
671 (1981); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 932-33, 95
S.Ct. 2561, 2568-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); California v. LaRue,
409 U.S. 109, 116-18, 93 S.Ct. 390, 395-97, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972).
Most recently, in Barnes, the Supreme Court conceded that nude
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection.
(FN4) Barnes, --- U.S. at *391 111 S.Ct. at 2460. In Barnes, the
Court reviewed a Seventh Circuit opinion authored by Judge Flaum,
Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir.1990)
(en banc), rev'd sub nom. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), which thoroughly
analyzed the questions of whether and how nude dancing is expression
entitled to First Amendment protection. The Miller opinion noted
that dance is inherently expressive entertainment, as it conveys
emotions and ideas. Judge Flaum refused to distinguish &quot;high&quot;
art from &quot;low&quot; entertainment on the asserted basis that
low entertainment &quot;fail[s] to communicate a defined intellectual
thought.&quot; Id. at 1086. Applying the test enunciated in Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989), (FN5) he concluded that nude dancing communicated
a message of eroticism and sensuality, understood by its viewers
as such. Miller, 904 F.2d at 1087. Thus, notwithstanding its artistic
quality, nude dancing was sufficiently expressive to entitle it
to First Amendment protection. Justice White's dissent in Barnes
echoed Judge Flaum's opinion:
<P>
&quot;[W]hile the entertainment afforded by a nude ballet at Lincoln
Center to those who can pay the price may differ vastly in content
(as viewed by judges) or in quality (as viewed by critics), it
may not differ in substance from the dance viewed by the person
who ... wants some 'entertainment' with his beer or shot of rye.&quot;
<P>
Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2475, 115 L.Ed.2d at 529
(White, J., dissenting) (quoting Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, 501
F.2d 18, 21 n. 3 (2d Cir.1974), modified sub nom. Doran v. Salem
Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)).
<P>
In sum, although the Barnes plurality did not explore these views,
it appears that the low quality of entertainment does not necessarily
weigh in the First Amendment inquiry. It would seem, therefore,
that the Fraternity's skit, even as low-grade entertainment, was
inherently expressive and thus entitled to First Amendment protection.
See Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2460;

<P>

<P>
The University nevertheless contends that discovery will demonstrate
that the contest does not merit characterization as a skit but
only as mindless fraternity fun, devoid of any artistic expression.
It argues further that entitlement to First Amendment protection
exists only if the production was intended to convey a message
likely to be understood by a particular audience. See Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). From the summary judgment record, the University insists,
it is impossible to discern the communicative intent necessary
to imbue the Fraternity's *392 conduct with a free speech component.
<P>
As indicated, we feel that the First Amendment protects the Fraternity's
skit because it is inherently expressive entertainment. Even if
this were not true, however, the skit, in our view, qualifies
as expressive conduct under the test articulated in Texas v. Johnson.
It is true that the Johnson test for determining the expressiveness
of conduct requires &quot; '[a]n intent to convey a particularized
message' &quot; and a great likelihood &quot; 'that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.' &quot; Id. (quoting
Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730,
41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). As Johnson and Spence point out, however,
the intent to convey a message can be inferred from the conduct
and the circumstances surrounding it. Thus viewed, the University's
argument is self-defeating. The affidavit from the University's
Vice-President, Earl Ingram, stated that the message conveyed
by the Fraternity's conduct--that racial and sexual themes should
be treated lightly--was completely antithetical to the University's
mission of promoting diversity and providing an educational environment
free from racism and sexism.
<P>
Dean Bumgarner, in his affidavit, stated that the University does
not and cannot condone this type of on-campus behavior which perpetuated
derogatory racial and sexual stereotypes, tends to isolate minority
students, and creates a hostile and distracting learning environment.
Such behavior is incompatible with, and destructive to, the University's
mission of promoting diversity within its student body [and] sends
a message to the student body and the community that we ... are
not serious about hurtful and offensive behavior on campus.
<P>
Importantly, the affidavits establish that the punishment was
meted out to the Fraternity because its boorish message had interfered
with the described University mission. It is manifest from these
circumstances that the University officials thought the Fraternity
intended to convey a message. The Fraternity members' apology
and post-conduct contriteness suggest that they held the same
view. To be sure, no evidence suggests that the Fraternity advocated
segregation or inferior social status for women. What is evident
is that the Fraternity's purposefully nonsensical treatment of
sexual and racial themes was intended to impart a message that
the University's concerns, in the Fraternity's view, should be
treated humorously. From the Fraternity's conduct and the circumstances
surrounding it, we have no difficulty in concluding that it intended
to convey a message.
<P>
As to the second prong of the Johnson test, there was a great
likelihood that at least some of the audience viewing the skit
would understand the Fraternity's message of satire and humor.
Some students paid to attend the performance and were entertained.
What the Fraternity did not anticipate was the reaction to their
crude humor by other students on campus and University officials
who opposed the racist and sexist implications of the Fraternity's
skit.
<P>
Even considering, therefore, the sparsity of the evidentiary record,
we are persuaded that the Fraternity's &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
satisfies the Johnson test for expressive conduct. (FN6)

<P>
If this were not a sufficient response to the University's argument,
the principles relating to content and viewpoint discrimination
recently emphasized in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), provide a definitive answer.
Although the Court in St. Paul reviewed the constitutional effect
of a city &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance, and we review the
constitutionality of sanctions imposed for violating University
policy, St. Paul 's rationale applies here with equal force. Noting
that St. Paul's city ordinance prohibited displays *393 of symbols
that &quot;arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; but did
not prohibit displays of symbols which would advance ideas of
racial or religious equality, Justice Scalia stated: &quot;The
First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special prohibitions
on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.&quot;
Id. at ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2541, 2547.
<P>
As evidenced by their affidavits, University officials sanctioned
Sigma Chi for the message conveyed by the &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
because it ran counter to the views the University sought to communicate
to its students and the community. (FN7) The mischief was the
University's punishment of those who scoffed at its goals of racial
integration and gender neutrality, while permitting, even encouraging,
conduct that would further the viewpoint expressed in the University's
goals and probably embraced by a majority of society as well.
&quot;The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
... expressive conduct because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.&quot;
Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2542 (citing Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406,
109 S.Ct. at 2540).
<P>
The University, however, urges us to weigh Sigma Chi's conduct
against the substantial interests inherent in educational endeavors.
See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S.
503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). The University certainly
has a substantial interest in maintaining an educational environment
free of discrimination and racism, and in providing gender-neutral
education. Yet it seems equally apparent that it has available
numerous alternatives to imposing punishment on students based
on the viewpoints they express. (FN8) We agree wholeheartedly
that it is the University officials' responsibility, even their
obligation, to achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand,
a public university has many constitutionally permissible means
to protect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as
have other courts, that &quot;the manner of [its action] cannot
consist of selective limitations upon speech.&quot; St. Paul,
--- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2548; see also Carey v. Brown,
447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (invalidating
a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (invalidating a law that allowed wearing
military uniforms only in dramatic portrayals that did not &quot;tend
to discredit the military&quot;). The First Amendment forbids
the government from &quot;restrict[ing] expression because of
its message [or] its ideas.&quot; Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408
U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). The University
should have accomplished its goals in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its viewpoint.
<P>
The decision of the district court is affirmed.
<P>
AFFIRMED.
<P>
MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in judgment:
<P>
While I agree with the majority's affirmance of the district court's
grant of summary judgment, I feel that its reasoning goes unnecessarily
too far. By holding that the First Amendment prohibits any action
by a public university to prevent or punish offensive conduct
like that at issue, the majority *394 goes much further than necessary,
going beyond the facts of the instant case in order to reach a
conclusion unsupported by First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
The present case can be decided easily within the contours of
First Amendment law simply by holding that George Mason University's
action violated the Fraternity members' rights by punishing them
post hoc and in conflict with its tacit approval of their performance.
Instead, the majority ranges far to discuss what it has concluded
the law would be absent such permission. The majority opinion
expounds upon the development of First Amendment doctrine and
concludes that George Mason was absolutely forbidden from regulating
speech based on its content. However, the Supreme Court has held
repeatedly that a content-based regulation of protected expression
survives judicial scrutiny if it &quot; 'is necessary to serve
a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. New York Crime Victims
Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). Accord
Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983);
<P>
Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
Thus, the Supreme Court has recognized that regulation of speech
based on its content is not only permissible but, in limited circumstances,
justified.
<P>
In an attempt to reach a much broader conclusion, the majority
cites from Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95,
92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Yet, the quoted passage
from Mosley misrepresents its holding. The Mosley Court did not
rule that Chicago's selective proscription of nonlabor picketing
was per se unconstitutional, but rather indicated that the regulation
would be valid if Chicago demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
408 U.S. at 100, 92 S.Ct. at 2292. A complete reading of First
Amendment jurisprudence reveals &quot;that content-based distinctions,
far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable and indispensable
aspect of a coherent understanding of the First Amendment.&quot;
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2563,
120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (Stevens, J. concurring).
<P>
George Mason's treatment of the Fraternity is not itself constitutionally
flawed, because the University was concerned about the message
of the students' performance, but because of the permission to
give the performance which the University granted. The University,
following the Fraternity's performance of the skit, meted out
punishment to the Fraternity, without any prior indication that
such behavior was not allowed at school-sanctioned events, and
despite indicating that the Fraternity's skit had University approval.
<P>
Actually, forbidding the skit or requiring substantial amendment
was not beyond its power. The University does have greater authority
to regulate expressive conduct within its confines as a result
of the unique nature of the educational forum. Tinker v. Des Moines
School District, 393 U.S. 503, 513, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d
731 (1969) (holding that expressive activity in a school setting
can only be restricted if it &quot;materially disrupts classwork
or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of
others&quot;); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.
104, 117-118, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2304, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (stating
that the Court had never &quot;suggested that students, teachers,
or anyone else has an absolute right to use all parts of a school
building or its immediate environs for his [or her] unlimited
expressive purposes&quot;); cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
276-277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981).
<P>
In Widmar, Justice Stevens, concurring in judgment, has provided
an insightful analysis of the special character of institutions
of higher education:
<P>
Today most major colleges and universities are operated by public
authority. Nevertheless, their facilities are not open to the
public in the same way that streets and parks are. University
facilities--private or public--are maintained primarily for the
benefit of the student body and the  faculty. In performing their
learning and *395. teaching missions, the managers of a university
routinely make countless decisions based on the content of communicative
materials. They select books for inclusion in the library, they
hire professors on the basis of their academic philosophies, they
select courses for inclusion in the curriculum, and they reward
scholars for what they have written. In addition, encouraging
students to participate in extracurricular activities, they necessarily
make decisions concerning the content of those activities.
<P>
454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). In the present case, the University, by officially
recognizing Greek-letter social organizations and participating
in the planning of their events, inevitably has participated in
the activities of those groups. Therefore, it must retain the
ability to refuse to sanction certain behavior which infringes
on the rights of other students. The University need not allow
activity distinctly injurious to its objectives.
<P>
Certainly, the most fundamental concern of a university is to
provide the optimum conditions for learning. The majority concedes
that &quot;the University certainly has a substantial interest
in maintaining an educational environment free of discrimination
and racism, and in providing gender-neutral education.&quot; Therefore,
the University must have some leeway to regulate conduct which
counters that interest, and thereby infringes upon the right of
other students to learn. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct.
at 740; cf. R.A.V., --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2565 (Stevens,
J. concurring) (&quot;A selective proscription of unprotected
expression designed to protect 'certain persons or groups' would
be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate determination
that the harm created by the regulated expression differs from
that created by the unregulated expression.&quot;).
<P>
By concluding that a university must be allowed to regulate expressive
conduct which runs directly counter to its mission, I do not mean
to imply that a university has the unrestricted power to silence
entirely certain perspectives. I wholeheartedly believe that the
free exchange of ideas and debate are fundamental to a place of
learning. Yet, they comprise only part of a university's mission
and must be balanced against a university's other interests, especially
those interests which rise to the level of constitutional significance.
(FN*)
<P>
Moreover, if the University, in advance, had refused to allow
the Fraternity to perform its intended skit, the marketplace of
ideas would hardly have been endangered. The Fraternity, if it
wished, could have presented its ideas and perspectives on the
value of women and Blacks in an open debate, allowing other students
to challenge its perspective.
<P>
All in all, my concurrence rests on the unrevoked permission to
give the skit. I find it unnecessary, and of doubtful validity,
to suggest that, regardless of such approval, there was any First
Amendment provision guaranteeing the right to give the skit, in
circumstances under which it was inextricably linked with George
Mason University.

FN4. At least eight justices agreed that First Amendment protection
extends to nude dancing, but they differed in their approaches
to defining that protection. Justice Rehnquist, writing for a
plurality, relied on the four-part test announced in United States
v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
He concluded that the Indiana statute prohibiting public nudity
was constitutional because it was unrelated to the suppression
of speech, infringed only incidentally on protected expression,
and furthered the important government interest of prohibiting
public nudity. Justice Scalia concurred in the result, but wrote
separately because he believed the statute regulated conduct,
not expression. Justice Souter also wrote separately because he
believed that the state's interest was to combat secondary effects,
an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.
<P>
Justice White, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens,
dissented, stating that the Indiana statute targeted the erotic
message communicated by nude dancing. He would have applied a
higher standard of scrutiny than the O'Brien test requires. *395_
<P>
Because the sanctions imposed in this case targeted the message
communicated by Sigma Chi's skit and are thus related to the suppression
of speech, we do not rely on the O'Brien balancing test as the
Barnes plurality did.

said that one factor weighing in the equation of whether conduct
is expressive is &quot;whether the activity in question is commonly
associated with expression.&quot; Id. at 769, 108 S.Ct. at 2150.
A live, albeit crude, skit performed for an audience is an activity
commonly associated with expression.
<P>
FN7. Nor can we accept the University's contention that the sanctions
were imposed as a result of the Fraternity's &quot;pure conduct,&quot;
unrelated to its communicative aspects or viewpoint. See Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 702-05, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 3175-77,

336 U.S. 77, 89, 69 S.Ct. 448, 454, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). The University's

FN* In a case decided one month prior to R.A.V., the Supreme Court
noted that among the most difficult First Amendment cases were
those requiring a reconciliation of our commitment to free speech
with our commitment to other constitutional rights. Burson v.
Freeman, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1851, 119 L.Ed.2d
5 (1992). In Burson, the Court ultimately upheld the content-based
regulation, namely, a Tennessee law prohibiting election-day political
speeches within 100 feet of a polling place, holding that the
State's interest in protecting the right to vote was sufficiently
compelling.

<P>
v.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
HILTON, District Judge.
<P>
This matter comes before the court on plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and defendants' motion to dismiss. In this action, the
plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for George Mason
University's imposition of discipline on the plaintiff fraternity
which has allegedly abridged the plaintiffs' right of free speech.
Plaintiffs argue that the discipline imposed upon *793 them unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First Amendment. Defendants
contend that the plaintiffs' conduct was not protected speech
and that if protected speech, George Mason University has compelling
educational interests at stake which justify the discipline imposed
on plaintiffs.
<P>
This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. This court
has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1331 and 1343 and may give declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 2201. The plaintiffs in this action are the Iota Xi Chapter
of Sigma Chi Fraternity which is at George Mason University (GMU)
and two members of the fraternity, the president and the immediate
past president of the chapter. Defendant GMU is a public university
maintained and funded in significant part by the Commonwealth
of Virginia which was acting as an educational institution at
all relevant times. Defendant Dean Bumgarner is the associate
vice president and dean of student services at GMU who was acting
on behalf of GMU at all relevant times.
<P>
For the past two years, a week long event known as Derby Days
has been held at GMU by the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi. Derby
Days is a major social event for the chapter and is held to raise
money for charity. One event during Derby Days has traditionally
been the &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; contest in which members of the
fraternity dress as caricatures of &quot;ugly women&quot;.
<P>
During the week of March 11, 1991, Dominic Lapus, an Iota Xi chapter
member acting as co-chair of the 1991 Derby Days program, submitted
the printed Derby Days program for approval to Kathryn Schilling,
GMU's assistant director of student organizations and programs.
The program listed the following as one event: &quot;Dress a SIG
contest (dress coaches like ugly women.)&quot;. As in former years,
university approval was sought. Ms. Schilling approved the Derby
Days program on behalf of the university, after requiring numerous
changes to be made in the proposed program. She required no changes
whatsoever to be made relative to the proposed &quot;ugly woman&quot;
contest.
<P>
The &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; event took place on April 4, 1991
in the cafeteria of the student union building on the campus of
GMU. In that event, one of the participants dressed in black face,
used pillows to represent breasts and buttocks and wore a black
wig with curlers. One week later, several GMU student leaders
signed a letter to Dean Bumgarner requesting the imposition of
sanctions on the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi as the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest had offended them because it perpetuated racial
and sexual stereotypes. On April 19, 1991 Dean Bumgarner announced
the proposed discipline and clarified that discipline in a letter
on May 1, 1991. The discipline imposed by Dean Bumgarner and GMU
prevents the plaintiffs from holding social and sports activities
for a two year probationary period and, during that same period,
requires the chapter to submit other planned activities to the
university for advance approval.
<P>
Plaintiffs and defendants agree that the First Amendment claims
are ripe for summary judgment. As there are no material facts
in dispute on the First Amendment claims, it is proper to resolve
this issue on summary judgment.
<P>
One of the fundamental rights secured by the First Amendment is
that of free, uncensored expression, even on matters some may
think are trivial, vulgar or profane. Berger v. Battaglia, 779
F.2d 992, 1000 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106
S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986). Because that fundamental right
extends to students at a state university, a state university
may not hinder the exercise of First Amendment rights simply because
it feels that exposure to a given group's ideas may be somehow
harmful to certain students. Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews,
544 F.2d 162, 166 (4th Cir.1976); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
187-88, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2349-50, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).
<P>
Plaintiffs assert that the discipline imposed by GMU unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First *794 Amendment. Defendants,
however, argue that the behavior of the plaintiffs at the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest was not expressive and therefore, not protected
speech. Defendants contend that only political and social speech
are protected by the First Amendment and that this conduct is
neither. However, the Supreme Court has held that activity such
as nude dancing and performance in black face are protected expression
under the First Amendment. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough
of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Berger v. Battaglia, 779 F.2d 992 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied,
476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
<P>
In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), Indiana enforced a public indecency law
which prevented the respondent establishments from providing totally
nude dancing as entertainment. Although nude dancing was protected
by the First Amendment, the Court held that the Indiana public
indecency law was permissible. The Court found that the Indiana
law sought to regulate conduct, specifically public nudity, and
not an expressive message. 111 S.Ct. at 2463. The Court noted
that &quot; 'It is possible to find some kernel of expression
in almost every activity a person undertakes ... but such a kernel
is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection
of the First Amendment.' &quot; Id. at 2462 (quoting Dallas v.
Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18
(1989)).
<P>
In this case, however, GMU did not seek to regulate any conduct
whatsoever. It was not the conduct of renting the auditorium,
holding Derby Days, raising money for charity, providing entertainment,
or performing a skit which prompted GMU to discipline the members
of Sigma Chi. To the contrary, it was the expressive message conveyed
by the skit which was perceived as offensive by several student
groups which prompted GMU to discipline the fraternity. This skit
contained more than a kernel of expression; therefore, the activity
demands First Amendment protection.
<P>
Even if the activity is protected, the defendants contend that
any infringement on the First Amendment rights of the Sigma Chi
fraternity is permissible because compelling educational interests
are at stake. In particular, the defendants assert that Sigma
Chi's behavior undermines the education of minority and women
students, the university's mission to promote learning through
a culturally diverse student body, the university's mission to
eliminate racist and sexist behavior on campus and the university's
mission to accomplish maximal desegregation of its student body.
Although the university has these interests, there has been no
substantial or material disruption of GMU's educational mission.
See Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 106
S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Crosby v. Holsinger, 852
F.2d 801 (4th Cir.1988). The student activity at issue in this
action is consistent with GMU's educational mission in conveying
ideas and promoting the free flow and expression of those ideas.
<P>
Furthermore, defendants have only alleged general, unspecified
claims of harm to the students who were exposed to the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. &quot;The First Amendment does not guarantee
that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such
as the principle that discrimination based on race is odious and
destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas.&quot;
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2546, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Berger v. Battaglia
a more appropriate response to the activities of the fraternity,
and one consistent with the First Amendment &quot;would have been
instead to say to those offended by ... [the] speech that their
right to protest that speech by all peaceable means would be as
stringently safeguarded ... as would ... [the] right to engage
in it.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001.
<P>
Defendants also raise the issue of whether or not the cafeteria
auditorium used by the plaintiffs is a public forum. However,
that is not a compelling issue since GMU *795. permits the cafeteria
auditorium to be used upon written application by student groups
to hold charity events and to perform skits. In fact, GMU approved
the plaintiffs' application to use the cafeteria auditorium on
April 4, 1991.
<P>
Although appropriate time, place and manner restrictions on free
expression are permissible, a state university may not suppress
expression because it finds that expression offensive. See Piarowski
v. Illinois Community College, 759 F.2d 625, 630 (7th Cir.) (racially
and sexually offensive art work not subject to outright suppression
by state school), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 528,
88 L.Ed.2d 460 (1985). In this instance GMU has disciplined the
members of Sigma Chi because the activity was deemed offensive
by them and not because the members violated any time, place or
manner regulations imposed by the university on the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. In fact, Sigma Chi submitted a copy of a
schedule of proposed events for Derby Days, including the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; event, to the assistant director of student organizations
and programs at GMU. At that time no objections to the event were
made by GMU. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying
the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea
itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 109
S.Ct. at 2544. The First Amendment does not recognize exceptions
for bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance or ideas or matters
some may deem trivial, vulgar or profane.
<P>
Plaintiffs' expression occurred at a charity social event in the
cafeteria of the student union before an audience composed of
students and non-students who paid money to witness a performance.
Although the university disagreed with the message propounded
by the fraternity's activity, GMU may not discipline the students
by infringing on their First Amendment rights based on the perceived
offensive content of the activity. &quot;[O]ne of the most persistent
and insidious threats to first amendment rights has been that
posed by the 'heckler's veto,' imposed by the successful importuning
of government to curtail 'offensive' speech at peril of suffering
disruptions of public order.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001 (citations
omitted). In this instance, GMU sought to discipline the students
based precisely on the &quot;heckler's veto&quot;. That is not
permissible.
<P>
The court need not reach the defendants' motion to dismiss as
this summary judgment motion is dispositive. Summary judgment
is granted in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants are enjoined
from imposing any discipline on the plaintiffs as a result of
the activity of April 4, 1991.

<h2>Introduction & Summary</h2>

<P>        America is in the midst of an historic period of  dynamic change and
opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In 1995, one half of
all capital investment in America, broadly defined, will be in computers and
telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications industry already
constitutes one seventh of our economy and is growing.  By the early 21st
century, the global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion
market.  Yet the government statutory and regulatory system now in place was
erected in the 1930s during the New Deal and embodies the limits and
technological realities of a long-vanished era.

<P>        To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern and efficient
governmental role with respect to telecommunications is needed.  Government
can, and indeed should, perform certain tasks.  This report is an effort to
identify and focus on the essential governmental functions needed for America
to enter the new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of past
practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by competitive markets.
 The report has a simple goal: to provide for a modern and effective
government to complement market forces to speed the development of  new
products and services for Americans.

<P>        The new, smaller government role (hereafter the <I>Replacement Model</I>) is
based on a functional analysis of what a government should be for a digital
era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional analysis reveals certain
overarching principles which are applied by the Replacement Model.
 Conceptually, a functional analysis supports a government role for ensuring
parity of  opportunity  across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast,
DBS and video dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry
should reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative
regulatory handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the "OC") to be located within an
existing Executive Branch agency.  

<P>        The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing the
implementation of a transition from the current practice of universal service
based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies to a smaller, more efficient
and targeted needs -- based system; (2) overseeing the mass privatization of
 spectrum to the American people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction
process; (3) coordinating a non-interference standard to govern the private
sector's use of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new, more focused
 governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional antitrust enforcement
utilizing existing expertise and personnel located within the U.S. Department
of Justice. 

<P>        The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action plan for the
transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing statutes, rules and
regulations are either eliminated immediately, subject to a three year sunset
provision, or retained and re-assigned to the Replacement Model's Office of
Communications.  At the end of the sunset period, those rules and regulations
deemed necessary by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition
will be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.

<P>        Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and modernizing
the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the systemic influence of
 regulations and statutes which authorize the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications
Commission</A> ("FCC") and have inflicted staggering costs upon American
consumers and the economy.  The report recognizes that other restrictions
arising from federal/state mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment
("MFJ")  settlement also have had an impact on competition.  

<P>        The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules and
regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive regulation the
U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual growth. Current public
servants may be dedicated and hard working.  It is the system itself which in
some measure mandates that the FCC engage in certain practices and procedures
which block new products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular,
voice mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services. For
decades these technologies have been denied Americans while the FCC struggled
to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price competition has been stymied
and business costs ultimately borne by the American public have been
needlessly inflated by a plethora of entry, ownership and contractual
regulations of telephone and media markets. Part One details the history of
this structural obstruction of technology and competition.

<P>        Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service is a key
ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic dialtone telephone
service for those truly in need is an essential element to a sustainable
modernization of government's role.  Part Two offers two approaches to
providing basic service for those truly in need.  The approaches make the
actual price of phone service open and clear to the American people.
 Currently, a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates subsidize
residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies, not consumers.
 Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.  The current system imposes burdens
on those allegedly it seeks to help -- those financially less well off.  An
urban, single parent family on government assistance programs today actually
subsidizes the phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls
from a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous.

<P>         Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions of
dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys incentives
to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan, no one really pays the
true cost of the phone services they use.  The replacement model puts a halt
to this muddle.  

<P>        The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization, promotion of
so-called "universal service," but in ways that are more accountable,
explicit and efficient.  Both plans recognize a national  interest in keeping
basic phone service affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three
facets.  First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount needed on a
going forward basis to provide wireline service to those areas.  Second, the
model embraces use of  a specific, targeted means test to provide assistance
to those truly in need.  Third, the responsibility for the remainder of the
universal service subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would
devolve to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition and
result in substantially lower prices.

<P>        The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local exchange costs
that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction are returned to the
respective states.  Each state could recover those costs as deemed fit,
subject to federal guidelines.  Under this model, federal law would  pre-empt
entry restrictions and prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users
for comparable services. 

<P>        Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding price
discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.  Moreover,
the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption of state regulation
of wireless services.

<P>        In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is transferred to
private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.  In Phase One, those with
current licenses in spectrum are granted title to the spectrum currently
used.  These owners of spectrum , the vast majority of whom have already
purchased their stations, will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum
as they deem necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced
through traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in the
courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse to the OC for
interference issues and use of laboratories for testing and evaluation of new
equipment and technologies.

<P>        In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1, 1995,  would
be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited basis.  In addition, the OC
will on an expedited basis, begin to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the
presumptive use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids for the
spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up, demand-driven
process will allow market forces to determine spectrum use and jump start
competition and technological innovation.  

<P>        In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning over its
spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited survey of available
spectrum bands, establishing standardized parcels for entrants to claim.  The
government currently presides over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum
far in excess of its needs for possible use by the <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/defenselink/index.html">Department of Defense</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</A>, etc. 

<P>        In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim title to
available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey. In the event that
there are multiple claimants for a particular parcel of spectrum, an auction
will be held.  Each department making the spectrum available that is subject
to an auction will retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to
more efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.

<P>        The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions a governmental
role for coordinating "spectrum contours," "overlay rights" and "band
management rights" but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made
available for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not mere licenses.
 Those who claim unchallenged use of identified parcels or bid and win title
to spectrum are free to develop and/or re-sell the spectrum as with any other
private property right subject to antitrust review and the geographic and
interference boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum market and
to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent announcements by the
government confirmed that auctioning spectrum can also have a supplemental
benefit of raising billions in revenue for deficit reduction.

<P>        Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for implementing
the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns and re-organizes the
functions now performed by the FCC.  The goal is to focus on the critical
tasks for today and the future.  Government unquestionably should fulfill
some functions and services for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should
be eliminated immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and
regulations would be sunsetted in three years.

<P>         The Replacement Model updates government to account for the differences
between the analog past and the technologies now emerging through market
forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted administrative,
bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.  Two old, major assumptions
-- (1) the existence of a "natural monopoly" in telecommunications; and (2)
the assumption that technology would remain essentially static or unchanging
-- are untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break with
the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement and by
transferring authority to the states in those instances when monopoly
regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new role for government is
leaner, more cost effective and serves the American people.   This, then,  is
a call to action to meet the challenges of the telecommunications revolution
-- an American opportunity.

<p>
<a  name="intro"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	As part of congressional budget reconciliation, the House Agriculture Committee considered the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195) on September 20. This legislation, sponsored by Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would significantly change the wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice programs. Before the legislation was considered in committee, Roberts also incorporated serious reform of the dairy program into the Act. With certain modifications, the proposal represents serious reform of America's obsolete farm programs.1<p>	Unfortunately, Chairman Roberts' attempt to provide a beginning for real reform suffered a setback when entrenched special interests, led by the National Cotton Council, succeeded in lining up a majority of the committee to vote against his bill. Nevertheless, the possibility for real reform is not yet dead, because the proposal may be considered again later this week, either by a reconvened House Agriculture Committee or by the House Budget Committee. Because a majority of the members of the House Agriculture Committee already have demonstrated their hostility to reform, the prospects for success appear better in the House Budget Committee.

<p>	Later this week, the Senate Agriculture Committee also will address budget reconciliation, and Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN), who has been an advocate of fundamental reform, may propose incorporation of a number of provisions drawn from the Freedom to Farm Act. Unlike the House, the Senate Agriculture Committee must resist the pressure of entrenched special interests and support the end of farm welfare.
<p>
	While the Freedom to Farm Act proposes reform for some programs, other important programs are overlooked. The Act does not include reform of either the sugar or peanut programs, even though these programs also face reauthorization this year and must be addressed, either in budget reconciliation or in the 1995 farm bill. Their anti-competitive and tightly controlled production systems limit the supply of these commodities while insulating these industries from the demands of the market. Removing supply restrictions will allow these industries to respond more effectively to new market opportunities and contribute to the nation's economic growth.2
<p>
	In July, during consideration of the House agriculture appropriations bill, Chairman Roberts promised reform-minded Members that they would have an opportunity to offer amendments to reform the sugar and peanut programs during floor consideration of the farm bill. These promises, and the argument that Members should wait for the farm bill to offer amendments that change agricultural policy, succeeded temporarily in slowing the drive for reform. But whether these programs are dealt with in the farm bill or in reconciliation, any proposals considered must represent real reform.
<p>
	The Agriculture Committees must not take the politically convenient course and adopt policies that preserve the anti-competitive aspects of the sugar and peanut programs. While the budget reconciliation instructions might provide the impetus for them to accept some sort of phase-down or phase-out of the more expensive commodity programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, there is no similar pressure to reform the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. These programs are different because wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice are supported through subsidies based on what is produced. This amounts to a direct transfer of funds from taxpayers to producers. In no-net-cost programs, however, the commodity is supported through tightly limited production. This amounts to a transfer of funds from consumers to producers at little or no cost to the Treasury. Nevertheless, no-net-cost programs still impose significant economic costs on the nation.
<P>
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>
<p>
<a name="sugar"></a><b>REFORMING THE SUGAR PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	The current sugar program operates as a cartel in which a handful of wealthy processors determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country. Production is supported by loans of 18 cents per pound for raw cane and refined beet sugar, an amount determined by a formula that supposedly reflects the relative difference in producer returns for sugar beets and sugarcane. The result is a U.S. price nearly twice as high as the world price. The law requires that this program be operated at "no-net-cost" to the government, which means prices must be maintained at levels high enough to avoid forfeiture to the government. To assure this, the government imposes import quotas and a system of domestic marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar processed for domestic use. While the amount of sugar refined may exceed the marketing allotment, it may not be sold in the United States. This further stifles domestic production.
<P>
	Because there is no cost to the taxpayers,3 defenders of the sugar program argue that it should be preserved. However, this program -- which controls sugar prices, limits imports to keep the prices high, and then dictates how much domestically produced sugar can be sold -- does impose a cost of $1.4 billion annually on U.S. consumers,4 who are forced to pay it through higher prices for products containing sugar. Moreover, consumers are not the only ones hurt. Because of its excessive subsidies, the program has forced a number of refineries that process raw sugar to close, eliminating domestic jobs and displacing workers.
<P>
	There have been discussions within certain segments of the sugar refining industry and among Agriculture Committee members about offering an alternative to the current sugar program that would reduce the support price from 18 cents per pound to 14 cents in the 1996 crop year, 13 cents in the 1997 crop year, and 12 cents in the 1998 crop year. Thus, the support price would have a floor of 12 cents per pound even though the world price is now at about 11 cents per pound and frequently has been much lower. This proposal also would terminate the sugar marketing quota and allotment program, but without making the sugar industry responsive to the world market price. It therefore fails to correct the problems of the current system.
<P>
	The sugar program is big government and corporate welfare at their worst. Almost half of its $1.4 billion in benefits goes to one percent of sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and one Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone.5
<P>
	The Sugar Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 1687), introduced by Representatives Dan Miller (R-FL) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and a Senate companion bill (S. 847) introduced by Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Bill Bradley (D-NJ) represent real reform that would benefit both farmers and consumers. Both the support price and the domestic marketing allotments would be eliminated immediately, allowing farmers to produce sugar to meet the demands of a free market. Unfortunately, all proposals introduced so far maintain existing import restrictions which artificially raise domestic prices for consumers. If the sugar program was eliminated, a market-oriented and internationally competitive policy would provide both reasonable sweetener prices and adequate supplies.
<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><p>

<a name="peanut"></a><b>REFORMING THE PEANUT PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	Incredibly, the peanut program actually restricts the right of Americans to produce peanuts. By establishing a quota system, it gives a limited few the exclusive right, based on inheritance or purchase, to produce peanuts in the United States for the U.S. market at a guaranteed high level of price support. These "quota" peanuts are supported at a much higher price ($678 per ton) than non-quota or "additional" peanuts, which are supported at $132 per ton. Only quota peanuts can be marketed in the U.S., while non-quota peanuts must be exported, sold to a processor responsible for exporting them, or sold to the government. To protect holders of peanut quotas even more from the effects of competition, peanut imports also are severely restricted. 
<P>
	 The peanut program is unfair not only to any farmer that would like to grow peanuts but cannot obtain a license, but also to those who succeed in buying or renting the right to produce peanuts. Two-thirds of those who own peanut growing licenses are not farmers, so farmers often must rent licenses from others. In fact, this usually is the most significant cost of producing peanuts. Although the cost of this program to taxpayers has been growing in recent years, the greatest cost falls on consumers who -- again -- are forced to pay higher prices.
<P>
	Proponents of maintaining the status quo are not concerned with the cost to consumers. They want to make the peanut program into another "no-net cost" program in the hope of preventing radical change. One way to do this is by merely reducing the support for quota peanuts from $678 a ton to $600 or $550 a ton. But while this approach might reduce the cost to taxpayers temporarily, based on current market prices, there is no assurance that costs would remain limited in the longer term. Nor would there be any expected reduction in the $300 million the program annually costs consumers; if world prices drop, the cost of the domestic program will increase.
<p>
	The only way to be sure that there is no cost while retaining the present structure is to restrict production further by reducing the amount of quota peanuts that can be produced. But, such a regressive action would penalize domestic consumers even more while reinforcing the barriers to entry in growing peanuts. Defenders of the status quo also have suggested that reducing the amount of quota peanuts -- in other words, reduce the supply to inflate the price -- could reduce the cost of the program.
<P>
	Such "reform" proposals are nothing but a hoax. The peanut program, like the sugar program, is beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can improve it. The only genuine reform of the peanut program is contained in the Peanut Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 2008), introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Andrew Jacobs (D-IN), and the companion Senate bill (S. 1027) introduced by Senators Hank Brown (R-CO) and Bill Bradley. These proposals would eliminate the program immediately. In addition, Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Richard Lugar have introduced S. 1188, which would phase out the quota system by the year 2000. Ending the quota and allotment systems will benefit farmers directly by removing one of the most significant costs of production -- rental of quotas -- and ending the discrimination against U.S.-grown non-quota peanuts. Eliminating the unproductive overhead costs will increase the share of consumer expenditures returned to the producer while, at the same time, increased domestic production of lower-cost peanuts will benefit the American consumer directly.
<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>
<p>


<a name="dairy"></a><b>REFORMING THE DAIRY PROGRAM</b>
<p>

	The dairy program guarantees that the federal government will purchase, at an established price, unlimited quantities of surplus cheese, butter, and dried milk. The law provides a mechanism by which the guaranteed purchase price can be lowered or raised, depending upon whether the government's purchases are expected to exceed or fall short of a preestablished level. Under no circumstance, however, can the support price drop below a floor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.
<P>
	When government guarantees that it will purchase any surplus production that cannot be sold in the marketplace, producers have no incentive to compete against each other. Thus, incentives for efficiency and innovation also disappear. Processors have no incentive to take the risks necessary to develop new products demanded by American and foreign consumers, so the industry is sluggish and unresponsive to the ever-changing demands of both domestic and international markets. 
<p>
	In addition, the nation's milk supply is regulated by an unbelievably complex and archaic system of federal milk marketing orders. Ostensibly designed to assure adequate supplies in all regions of the country, these marketing orders restrict the sale of milk between different regions. These pricing policies tend to raise the effective support price in high-cost regions of the country, encouraging farmers to increase production instead of permitting fluid milk to be shipped in profitably from lower cost regions. It is estimated that milk marketing orders cost consumers between $621 million and $851 billion in 1985 (in 1995 dollars, from $839 million to $1.15 billion).6  The program has hindered the U.S. dairy industry's ability to take advantage of the export market. There should be no restrictions on where milk is sold or marketed and no government attempts to manipulate interstate commerce in dairy products.
<p>
	However, the industry's reform proposal would make the situation even worse. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has outlined a proposal that would eliminate price supports for butter and powder. But it would retain price support for cheese, require the Secretary of Agriculture to buy about 2.4 billion pounds of dairy products, and mandate an increase in price supports, thereby further pushing up prices. By keeping the support price on cheese and requiring additional payments when lower world market-priced butter is used to produce other U.S. products, this proposal would insulate American dairy producers from the impact of eliminating price supports on butter and powder.
<p>
	In effect, this proposal would establish a two-tiered pricing system with a lower export price on butter and nonfat dry milk and a higher domestic price on fluid milk and cheese. U.S. manufacturers of products which use nonfat dried milk would be required to pay a higher price for that ingredient than would foreign manufacturers using the same U.S. product. This amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers.
<p>
	The expectation is that decoupling nonfat dry milk and butter from support prices would cause prices for these commodities to fall to world market levels and become competitive in international trade. However, requiring a higher price on nonfat dry milk and butter used as a domestic food ingredient would lead to a two-tier system for nonfat dry milk, with a higher price for domestic purposes than for international purposes. Ice cream, cheese, or confectionery manufacturers and bakers in the U.S. would be required to pay more for nonfat dry milk used to produce their products than would manufacturers in other countries using U.S.-made nonfat dry milk.
<p>
	Such a two-tiered pricing system not only would violate the GATT agreement, but also would make it virtually impossible for U.S. manufacturers of value-added products to compete in the world market. This will discourage expansion of that increasingly important potential export market while providing even more barriers to entry for those who are not in the industry at the present time, further limiting growth in the domestic market where 98 percent of U.S. production is consumed.
<P>
	The NMPF proposal also includes consolidating the 40 or so existing milk marketing orders into 8 to 12 market order areas. There have been other suggestions that existing federal and state milk market orders be consolidated into a single national order for all milk produced in the United States, thereby dramatically increasing the federal government's control over the marketing of milk. But consolidating milk marketing orders does nothing to reduce the federal government's involvement in and regulation of the dairy industry. In fact, mere consolidation will make the already unresponsive pricing system even less responsive to market forces.
<P>
	Two recent proposals represent real reform. For a time, there was only the Dairy Freedom Act introduced by Representative Thomas Petri (R-WI), which would end the trade-restrictive marketing orders on January 1, 1996, and phase out the dairy support program over five years. More recently, however, Chairman Roberts has incorporated a dairy reform proposal by Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI), Chairman of the Dairy Subcommittee. Similar to what Chairman Roberts has proposed for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice in the Freedom to Farm Act, Gunderson's proposal would eliminate the milk marketing orders' pricing and regulatory functions on July 1, 1996, and end the price support program on January 1, 1996, replacing it with transition payments to be made over the next seven years.

<a name="concl"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	If the House and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairmen can overcome the entrenched special interests standing in the way of reform and report the Freedom to Farm Act out of their respective committees, their committees will be making history by setting the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs on the path to reform. However, the true test of sweeping, fundamental reform will come when Congress decides what to do with the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. Incremental changes are not enough. Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs:  either outright elimination or reform comparable to what both Chairmen have proposed for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. By doing so, Congress will benefit farmers and signal clearly to the rest of the world that the United States intends to pursue an aggressively pro-growth agricultural policy into the 21st century.7<p><b>Endnotes:</b><ol><li>For a complete discussion of changes needed to improve the Freedom to Farm Act, see John E.

<h2>ADVANCING MEDICAL INNOVATION:</h2>
<P>
<B>Health, Safety and the Role of Government in the 21st Century</B>
<P>
<B>Executive Summary</B>
<P>
by 
Ralph A. Epstein, M.D., Thomas M. Lenard, Ph.D, Henry I. Miller, M.D., Robert D. Tollison, Ph.D., W. Kip Viscusi, Ph.D., William M. Wardell, M.D., Ph.D.
<P>
As Americans enter the 21st Century, we are poised to see tremendous
breakthroughs in medical technology - from genetic engineering
to surgical lasers to molecular transports.  Yet patients may
be denied these advances because the process for allowing new
medical products on the market is cumbersome, slow, expensive
and inefficient.  In order for Americans to have the latest technology
to improve their health - or even to survive - the Food and Drug
Administration - a prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory
agency - must be reformed for the 21st Century.
<P>
While reforms have been tried in the past, they failed to significantly
improve the speed with which patients have access to new  products;
failed reforms have been too marginal to make an impact.  Therefore,
the following plan calls for a completely new framework for approving
drugs and medical devices.  Its goal is simple:  the regulatory
process should be designed to block dangerous or ineffective products
while also speeding safe and effective ones to the clinic.  While
such a system will have a great impact on stopping the flight
of our medical companies overseas and maintaining American global
competitiveness, its fundamental benefit will be to save lives
and increase the quality of life for Americans.
<P>
Currently the FDA has a statutory monopoly on new product approvals.
 This monopoly eliminates any institutional check on the regulatory
creep that inexorably has added time, costs and unpredictability
to the review process.  These effects have stifled the development
and introduction of new technologies to patients.  As long as
the only route to market is through the FDA, adverse trends in
product availability will continue.
<P>
Therefore, our plan opens the product certification process to
competitive forces.  It is not a complete laissez faire approach
with no government oversight, because Americans want a required
independent review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  While
maintaining the existing legal requirements for pre-market demonstration
of safety and effectiveness, as well as the FDA stamp of apporval,
the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies - called Drug or Device
Certification Bodies - to review and certify new products.
<P>
The competition among the DCBs for clients will encourage them
to offer the greatest expertise and reputation for integrity,
to identify and solve problems early and rapidly, to perform reviews
in a timely manner, and to manage the oversight and review efficiently.
 The FDA's primary function will be to certify the quality of
the certifiers, not to actually be a certifier of products.  The
FDA retains authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing, but with a new appeal procedure in the event
of disagreement with a company and/or DCB.  Also, the FDA retains
a powerful post-marketing  system for monitoring the safety of
products.
<P>
Specific highlights of the plan are as follows:
<P>
<B>DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</B>
<P>
 
<UL>
<LI>For drugs and biologics, the primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application/Product License Application
review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental Drug
Certification Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be profit-making
or non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed - as required by the language of the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act - by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by scientific
training and experience.&quot;  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The sponsor will submit New Drug Applications/Product License
Applications to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the application,
the DCB will submit a summary of the results of its review (if
favorable) to FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated
period of time to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval
(which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to
deny approval.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>MEDICAL DEVICES</B>
<UL>
<LI>Manufacturers generally will have a choice of methods by which
to get a product approved for market, by either demonstrating
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Such a system is modeled on the
European Union's medical device regulatory system, which is characterized
by reliance on clear and objective standards that are largely
implemented by private, nongovernmental organizations.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>For all classes of devices except Class I (the least risky),
a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm conformance
with the necessary standards.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Class III products (the riskiest products) will require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the plan also requires the FDA to be notified 90 days
prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow time for the
FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.
</UL>

<P>
<B>APPEALS</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan establishes an independent, standing committee of experts
within the Department of Health and Human Services - the Medical
Review Board (MRB) - to advise the Secretary when the FDA disagrees
with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10 to 15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the HHS Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.
</ul><P>
<B>LIABILITY</B>
<P>
<ul>
The plan includes a regulatory compliance defense for all product
liability, not simply a defense against punitive damages.<B> 
</B>The regulatory compliance defense recognizes that, by negotiating
the regulatory process, the manufacturer has fulfilled its requirements
with respect to the provision of products that provide an appropriate
level of safety, and that the government has certified this fact.
 Lawyers and courts should not be second guessing decisions regarding
product safety that have already been recognized by government
agencies as having achieved appropriate levels of safety.  Our
plan for replacing the FDA drug and device approval processes
would not limit the applicability of this defense, because there
would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure that an
appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<P>
Of course DCBs will be subject to tort liability for negligence
in carrying out their obligations. Our plan recommends formalizing
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.
</ul>
<P>
<B>INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan recommends that products approved in jurisdictions whose
standards are similar to those in the United States - for example,
Great Britain or the European Union - have the same status as
a product certified by a DCB.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same rebuttable presumptions as a
DCB-approved product.
</ul><P>

<P>
In its current form, the Food and Drug Administration is a prototypical
centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency, similar to so many
other agencies designed during the heyday of the Progressive era.
 By modern standards, it is cumbersome, slow, expensive and inefficient.
 But its most significant costs are not financial - they are human.
 America's outmoded FDA directly results in jobs being exported
overseas.  And, most importantly, it denies new health technologies
to patients who need them to live healthy lives, or even to survive.
<BR>

<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation has undertaken a multi-year
effort to design and to create a new, modern institution that
will continue to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical
products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments.
 Two earlier versions of a replacement model for the FDA were
circulated to the public with request for comment.  In addition,
the Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Louis Sullivan,
provided valuable guidance.  The views expressed here-in are solely

<FONT >The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation began
its work developing a replacement model for medical technology
regulation in 1993, believing that the coming advances in medical
technology have the potential to dramatically increase both life
spans and the quality of life while greatly reducing the cost
of health care.  We also realized that this would only occur if
a regulatory process was in place that encouraged rather than
stifled innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We wish to thank our adjunct fellows - Ralph
Epstein, Henry Miller, Bob Tollison, Kip Viscusi and Bill Wardell
- who did a yeoman's job in designing a regulatory process for
the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We are particularly honored that Lou Sullivan
willingly and faithfully served as Chairman of our Advisory Committee.
 In addition 15 other individuals on the Advisory Committee gave
freely their time, expertise and advice throughout the process:
 Jack Calfee, Jim Driscoll, Henry Grabowski, Robert Helms, Peter
Barton Hutt, Sam Kazman, Jim Kitterman, Barb Lawton, Fred McChesney,
Keith Mowry, Paul Rubin, Gene Schonfeld, Leigh Thompson, Frankie
Trull and Gail Wilensky.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We are immensely grateful to several individuals
in Europe, both in government and industry, who took time out
of their busy schedules to meet with us and explain the European
approach for bringing pharmaceuticals and medical devices to the
marketplace.  Without their willingness to help us, our work would
have been far more difficult and frankly, incomplete.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Of course, not of this could have been possible
without generous financial support from individuals and organizations.
 Although funds are not targeted toward a specific project, many
medical device and pharmaceutical companies have supported our
foundation since 1993.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, we wish to thank over 1500 individuals
including organizations representing patients, physicians, consumers
and industry plus government officials and companies that were
asked to comment on our reports.  Many expressed concern for the
inability of a large bureaucracy to keep up with current science
and that FDA generally lags behind its European counterparts.
In spite of these concerns, most wanted to make sure that the
standards for safety and effectiveness would not be compromised.
 We thank all of those who took the time to provide advice, suggestions
and even criticism to the work we undertook.<BR>
