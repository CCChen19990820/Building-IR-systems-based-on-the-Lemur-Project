<P><B>A</B>merica is a global power with vital interests in key regions of 
the world, specifically in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the  Middle East.
America fought two world wars in this century to  preserve freedom and stability
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,  and then endured the long twilight
struggle of the Cold War,  including shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam, to
protect Europe and  Asia from communist domination. In effect, the U.S. is both
a  European and Pacific power. It has maintained a military presence in  Europe
and Asia since the end of the Second World War to protect  vital links of trade,
communication, and cultural exchange. And  even though the Cold War is over,
U.S. security interests still  require America's military, political, and
economic involvement in  European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf War dramatized the vital interests of  America and the
world's industrialized democracies in the Middle  East. U.S. air and naval
forces patrol the Eastern Mediterranean  and keep watch on the potential threat
from Iraq and Iran to the  Persian Gulf, still the source of much of the free
world's energy  supplies. In fact, the U.S. depends more on crude oil from the
Gulf  today than it did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To make the world safe for America, the U.S. needs to keep  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vital regions of Europe, Asia, and
the Persian Gulf free of  hostile domination. This strategy requires a mixture
of diplomacy  and military deterrence. The U.S. must maintain its military 
alliances in these regions and adapt them to new conditions. At the  same time,
new types of relationships with friends and allies, based  on trade and
commercial ties, must be advanced to supplement  (and possibly, in some cases,
replace) old ones based on military  alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect America's interests in various regions of the world,  the U.S.
needs some forces deployed overseas, the capability to  respond rapidly and
effectively to regional crises, and the ability  to support U.S. forces that
have been deployed overseas from  the continental United States. Effective
regional security  strategies, coupled with the means and the will to carry them
out, not  only will allow the U.S. to prevail in the event of a conflict, but 
also may deter aggression in the first place.

<a href="bosnia.gif">Map 1</a>: The NATO Mission in Bosnia: Operation Joint Endeavor
<p>
<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily responsible for  guaranteeing
that Western Europe would not be dominated by a  hostile power. With the demise
of the Soviet Union, many  Americans wonder what role America should play in
Europe and exactly  how the American role in the Atlantic alliance should be
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans believe that the U.S. should simply pull its  military forces
out of Europe. Others warn against such an action.  Historically, when it has
taken no notice of European affairs, the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  has been called upon to intervene
in conflicts that threaten the  global balance of power and the safety of
America as well. This  was the case in the First and Second World Wars and
during the  Cold War. Proponents of U.S. military involvement in Europe argue 
that America had to help defend Europe in order to defend the  security and
liberty of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue today is how to structure America's participation in  European
security. Should the U.S. be primarily a peacemaker in  settling civil wars like
the one in Bosnia?  Or should it confine  itself to the core mission of
collective defense, defending Europe  from major power threats regardless of the
source or sources of  those threats? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These questions are at the heart of the debate over NATO's  future. NATO has
been undergoing an identity crisis since the  Soviet Union collapsed. At issue
is whether the U.S. and its allies, in  order to make NATO more relevant, should
task the alliance  with out-of-area missions, including peacekeeping, peace 
enforcement, and other security activities NATO was never intended to  perform.
But this search for a new role could turn NATO into an  organization like the
United Nations, which, because of its many  different members and missions, is
not suited to organizing and  directing significant military operations. In the
end, some fear NATO  could become no more effective than the U.N. is now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For some in America, the question is not how the U.S. role  in NATO should
be defined, but whether the U.S. should be  in NATO at all. Others argue that
America's 100,000 troops in  Europe act as a stabilizing force that enhances
European  security; they believe that the American military presence in Europe
is  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  insurance policy against the
threat of war between any of  Europe's major powers. The cost of maintaining
these troops is a matter  for legitimate debate, but given the costs of a
European  conflagration, it is well worth paying. Those Americans who advocate 
pulling U.S. military forces out of Europe or reducing the U.S. presence  to a
skeleton force are saying, in essence, that the U.S. has no  vital national
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious NATO issue involves the peacekeeping  operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. is heavily involved in  the NATO Peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia, and while  the Clinton Administration has
promised to end the mission after  a one-year deployment, many questions arise:
If the promised  peace does not take hold, and especially if Americans are drawn
 into combat with one or more Bosnian factions, will the U.S. be able  to
withdraw on schedule?  
</P>
<P>Will the U.S. be able withdraw in the midst of renewed  fighting and
possible American casualties without the appearance of  an ignominious retreat,
and without harming U.S. credibility  and prestige?  What happens if peace has
not taken hold at the end  of one year?  Will the U.S. pull out anyway, bringing
the  European peacekeepers out with it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>NATO expansion is another significant issue in the debate  over Europe and
the U.S. role in Europe. NATO expansion would  extend NATO's zone of peace,
democracy, stability, and freedom  to its new members. Many security experts
believe that the  Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO
enlargement out  of fear of offending Russia. They maintain that Russia has an 
implicit veto over extending NATO membership to new democracies  in Central
Europe. However, critics of expansion maintain that  en
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  larging NATO will only encourage
an adversarial response  from Russia and may precipitate a return to Cold
War-style  relations. These critics also insist that expanding NATO will dilute
the  alliance, enlarging its commitments while weakening its basic  structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The economic prosperity of the United States is closely tied 
to trade with Europe. Europe is America's second largest  customer, taking 31
percent of American exports and providing 29 percent  of imports. Fifty percent
of direct American investment abroad is  in Europe and over 60 percent of direct
foreign investment in  the U.S. comes from Europe. Over three million Americans
are  employed in the U.S. by European-owned firms, and another 1.5  million
American workers are supported directly by U.S. exports  to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States maintains approximately 100,000 troops in 
Europe, and most of the troops involved in the Bosnia peace  implementation plan
were taken from U.S. forces based in  Europe. These forces are a key element in
America's national strategy  for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) European-based forces contribute directly to European 
stability and security</B> by giving clear evidence of America's  commitment,
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) The forces stationed in Europe are one ocean closer to many  of the
regions</B> in which the U.S. might be called to fight.  Approximately half of
the U.S. combat units deployed during  Operation 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  Desert Storm came directly from
Europe.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     NATO still consists of the 16 nations that belonged to the 
alliance at the end of the Cold War. France recently decided to rejoin  the
integrated NATO military structure, at least partially, after  leaving it in
1966. Spain, the NATO Secretary-General's home country,  is not integrated fully
into NATO's military structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Besides NATO's 16 full members, there are 27 states enrolled 
in the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program, a  U.S.
initiative that enables non-NATO nations to associate with  and apply for
membership in NATO. Almost every country of  Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union is a member of the  Partnership for Peace, designed as an
intermediate step to membership  in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A European collective security organization often touted by 
the Russians as a possible substitute for NATO is the Organization  for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Despite having over 50  members, however, OSCE is
little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot; for  general issues of European
security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration estimates that the Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Force will cost the U.S. between $2 billion and $3  billion per
year, but this does not include costs for the  reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure in Bosnia. Many experts believe that  the actual cost will be
closer to twice that predicted by the  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     European integration under the auspices of the European  Union
(EU) is proceeding more slowly than expected, and there is  no 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  certainty of a federal Europe, a
European army, or even a  unified currency in the immediate future. Last year
the EU expanded  to include Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Further expansion, 
especially in Eastern Europe, is not expected anytime soon,  although most
former Warsaw Pact countries are eager to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO  enlargement and
missed an important window of opportunity for  offering membership to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary,  and Slovakia, the most likely candidates for NATO
membership.  Instead of expanding Europe's zone of peace, security, and  freedom
to Central Europe, President Clinton has taken counsel of his  fears and handed
the Russians an implicit veto over when, where,  and how NATO should expand.
What has the U.S. received in return?   A meaningless Russian troop
participation in the Bosnian  peacekeeping operation  something of only marginal
interest to  the U.S. Every day NATO delays enlargement, opposition from  the
Russians grows. Former communists have regained power in  Central and Eastern
Europe and may soon do the same in Russia.  Unless the U.S. Administration acts
soon, the opportunity to  enlarge NATO may disappear.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The GOP's Contract With America called for NATO expansion  in the form of
near-term membership for Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
Both the House and Senate versions of  the foreign operations bill contained
language supporting this  expansion but neither specifically nor legally
mandating a concrete  time frame for expansion.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even as the Clinton Administration has delayed NATO  expansion, it has
committed U.S. power and prestige to a questionable  peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia. President Clinton has deployed  over 35,000 U.S. troops to support the
Peace Implementation  Force (IFOR). These troops are stationed in Croatia,
Hungary, Italy,  and afloat in the Adriatic Sea, and include 20,000 U.S. combat 
troops in northeastern Bosnia. His reason: to keep faith with U.S.  allies and
preserve NATO. But failure in Bosnia could wreck the  very cohesion that the
President hopes to preserve. If IFOR  fails, NATO could fail with it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration does not have an exit strategy for U.S.  forces in
Bosnia, the President invented one by promising that U.S.  forces will return
home in &quot;about a year.&quot;  Such an ambiguous and  poorly defined
commitment endangers the U.S. soldiers involved,  opens the door for &quot;mission
creep,&quot; and raises the possibility of a  long and open-ended commitment to
a mission that may never succeed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President assumes unrealistically that within a year the  new state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have resettled all  refugees, settled all territorial
disputes, conducted free and democratic  elections, and formed a new
constitutional central government  based on an elaborate power-sharing
agreement. Most experts agree  that these issues will take much longer to settle
and that U.S.  troops either will leave too soon to make a lasting contribution
or,  even worse, will be drawn into new roles and mandates that prolong  an
already ill-advised U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most troubling issues is what to do with indicted  war criminals.
If NATO tries to arrest them, the aggrieved faction  may pull out of the
agreement. But if these war criminals are ignored  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  released, the other side may take
matters into its own hands  and resume the fighting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From the beginning, Congress was reluctant to support  the Bosnian mission.
On December 13, 1995, the Senate voted  69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain
resolution, which supports the  men and women in uniform but &quot;does not
endorse the President's  decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton.&quot; 
The House was  more critical and voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while 
expressing support for the troops being deployed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Europe, the Administration and  Congress
should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Declare that America's vital national interest in Europe lies in 
preventing the domination of the continent by a hostile power or  bloc of
powers.</B> This is a clear and focused national interest. A  major power threat
to Europe would present a political and  economic threat to the peace, security,
and prosperity of the United  States itself, and America must be prepared to
defend this interest  with military action. This is done most effectively
through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Clearly define the role the U.S. will play in European security 
affairs and NATO.</B> First, an American military role must be  focused on the
core mission of NATO: collective defense. America  can support peacekeeping or
other out-of-area operations, but  the American contribution to NATO operations
should be  focused primarily on this core mission. Second, American military 
involvement should make a unique and decisive contribution to  any NATO
operation. American power will be squandered if it is  used 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  only to address peripheral and
marginal security issues that  the European allies are reluctant to undertake
themselves. This  will promote a clear and sensible division of labor with
America's  European allies and show the American people that the Europeans  are
&quot;pulling their weight&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the Europeans to take the lead in addressing  marginal
and peripheral security problems while guaranteeing an active  U.S. support role
in these endeavors.</B> In the past, an  American-led NATO effort was the only
option available for dealing with  a range of security issues in Europe. The
U.S. must promote a  more flexible range of responses to the many different
types of  security problems in and around Europe. When the U.S. role is 
re-focused on collective defense, the European powers can work  through other
structures (such as the Western European Union or OSCE)  to manage more marginal
security problems. This also will  prevent NATO from trying to become all things
to all people,  thereby minimizing the risk that the alliance could become an 
unwieldy and emasculated collective security organization instead of a  focused
and robust instrument of collective defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Offer immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary,  the Czech
Republic, and Slovakia and drop the implicit guarantee  of membership for other
countries in the Partnership for Peace.</B>  The addition of these countries to
Europe will expand NATO's zone  of peace and freedom and contribute to the core
mission of  collective defense against a major power threat to Europe. These 
countries are best suited for NATO membership. They have  demonstrated their
commitment to democracy, and their membership makes  strategic and geopolitical
sense for NATO. While other countries  can maintain a relationship with the PFP
or develop new ties with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  Western European Union, these
four Central European  countries should be the only new members admitted to NATO
itself.  Any more countries would be practically impossible for NATO to  defend
and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Lower expectations for &quot;success&quot; in the Bosnia peace 
implementation mission.</B> This can be done by limiting the U.S. military role 
to purely military functions and to operations that are both  clearly definable
and achievable. Above all, the U.S. must avoid  &quot;mission creep,&quot; or
escalation of the mission, in which IFOR might be  given long-term
nation-building or war crimes tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the European Union to maintain free trading  relations
with the U.S. and avoid instituting protectionist trade  measures.</B> The U.S.
should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested European countries,
including those in Central and Eastern  Europe. This should be initiated through
a &quot;framework agreement&quot;  to ensure that the EU and the U.S. stay on
track to create a  world-wide free trade regime in line with the WTO and GATT 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Cold War is over, and Europe is now full of many  prosperous
democratic states. Can't they bear the burden of their own  security?  Why do we
need to keep hundreds of thousands of  American troops over there?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> To defend our own freedom and security. A secure Europe is  a
vital U.S. interest. American freedom could not long endure if  all of Europe
with its resources and power were turned against  us. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Besides, the continued peace and
stability of Europe gives  considerable economic benefit to the United States.
Europe takes  almost one-third of U.S. exports and supplies 30 percent of
American  imports. Almost half of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe. 
In addition, millions of Americans are employed in the U.S. by  European-owned
firms, and millions more are supported by U.S.  exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't NATO expansion alienate Russia and risk creating a  new Cold
War with a new Iron Curtain in Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NATO membership brings security and stability. Therefore,  by
extending membership to Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, NATO
can help stabilize an area of Europe that  has rarely been either stable or
prosperous. NATO can work with  Moscow throughout this process to explain that
limited enlargement  is no threat to Russia. This should be done while the U.S.
has  relatively good relations with a friendly Russian administration.  The
return to power of a more nationalist Russian administration  is possible down
the road and would make NATO expansion  considerably more difficult. In any
event, however, Russian opposition  to NATO expansion is motivated mainly by
internal political  debates and economic instability, not by any real fear of
the West.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't expanding NATO just draw a line between East  and West, fueling
a new Cold War?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This is a line that inevitably must be drawn somewhere, 
sometime, unless you assume Russia will become a NATO member   something that is
both inadvisable and highly unlikely. Those  who complain about drawing lines
between East and West are  really 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  saying that they do not want the
free and democratic systems  of Western Europe moved east. NATO need not expand
to all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but it should incorporate 
those Central European states that strategically make sense to  NATO and which
politically, economically, and culturally already are  part of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should U.S. soldiers fight and die in a place like Bosnia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. soldiers should not fight and die in Bosnia, at least  under
current circumstances. American troops should be committed  to hostilities only
where their sacrifice is needed to protect  America's vital national interests.
That interest in Europe is to prevent  the continent from being dominated by a
hostile power or bloc of  powers. This is the core mission of NATO. American
combat  troops should not be deployed in the middle of peripheral civil wars  in
order to enforce a tenuous and cosmetic peace. The contribution  of American
combat forces to NATO must be unique and decisive,  as well as oriented toward
NATO's core mission of collective  defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What are U.S. interests in the Balkans?  What should we  do there now
that we are involved in the peacekeeping operation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Europe 
is not threatened by a major hostile power. To guarantee that  this vital
interest is protected, the U.S. should be willing to use  American combat
forces. The ethnic conflict in Bosnia does not  threaten the peace and stability
of Europe in this way. However, the  U.S. can assist the lead efforts of its
European allies in containing  and helping to resolve this conflict. The U.S.
can provide  logistical, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  intelligence, and air support for
European peacekeeping  operations, but American troops need not be involved
where  European troops can do the job. However, now that U.S. troops are there 
as part of IFOR, the U.S. should ensure that their mission is limited  to purely
military operations. Military objectives should be  clearly defined, and upon
achieving them, U.S. military forces  should leave. U.S. forces should not be
involved in rebuilding  Bosnia's political, economic, or social institutions.
This would be the  first step on the road to &quot;mission creep&quot; and would
ensure that  U.S. forces are drawn into the conflict with no clear exit in
sight.

<a href="korea.gif">Map 3</a>: The Korean Peninsula: 37,000 American Troops Deterring North Korea's Million-Man Army
<p>
<P><A NAME="ISSUESA"><B>THE ISSUES
</B></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's interests in Asia have remained consistent for two  centuries.
These interests are freedom of navigation, commercial  access to markets, and
preventing the domination of the region by  a hostile power or coalition of such
powers. The question  looming before America today is whether the United States
will retain  the leadership role in Asia required to defend these interests. 
After over three years of indecisive and faulty leadership from  the Clinton
Administration, the U.S. leadership role is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the President's policies  toward the
People's Republic of China (PRC). The Clinton  Administration has failed to
follow a consistent and coherent strategy  in dealing with China. As a result,
the U.S. has lost much of its  credibility in the region. For example, the
President, like many  liberals, tried to link trade with China to Beijing's
performance on  human rights issues. Conservatives, on the other hand, believing
that  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  best way to encourage democracy
and promote human rights  is through open trade, opposed early attempts by
Clinton to  deny China most-favored-nation trading status. Ultimately, the 
President had to reverse course, implicitly admitting the bankruptcy of  his
policies, but his inconstancy weakened his hand in dealing  with the Chinese and
undermined U.S. credibility in the region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is how to deal with the PRC's attempts  to
intimidate the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC). Bill  Clinton has demonstrated
an inclination to succumb to bullying  from Beijing. In early 1995, he sided at
first with the mainland  Chinese against granting a visa to permit Taiwan's
President, Lee  Teng-hui, to make an unofficial visit to the United States. He 
reversed course abruptly, granting the visa in May 1995, but only after 
pressure from Congress. Subsequently, the President was  painfully slow to
recognize the seriousness of Beijing's threats of  military force against the
ROC, including the testing of  nuclear-capable missiles in the vicinity of
Taiwan. Even when the  Administration abandoned its policy of ineffectual
diplomacy in March, after  three test missiles landed near two Taiwanese ports,
the Clinton  team shrank from labeling the Chinese actions for what they are  
political terrorism. Finally, mainly because of opposition  from Beijing,
Clinton has failed to provide adequate support  for Taiwan's entry into
international economic organizations like  the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. Taiwan deserves membership in
these  organizations because of its growing status as an economic  powerhouse
and emerging democracy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of the President's China policies argue that  Beijing should not
be allowed to dictate the terms of America's  unofficial 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  relations with Taiwan  terms
established by the 1979  Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which stipulates that
although the U.S.  does not have official relations with the ROC, it does stand
ready  to help Taiwan defend itself. Critics of the President insist that 
Taiwan should have the weapons necessary to defend its security  and that, if
necessary, the U.S. should provide the ROC with  these weapons. In particular,
it should be working with Taiwan to  build a defense against the PRC's ballistic
missiles, which threaten  Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the Korean peninsula, the issue is how to restore trust and  confidence
to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In pursuing its  nuclear bargain with North
Korea, called the Agreed Framework,  the Clinton Administration marginalized the
role of its ally South  Korea. Negotiating directly with North Korea, the U.S. 
got Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return  for help in
converting its nuclear reactors to peaceful purposes.  The North has used the
agreement to open a direct channel to the  U.S. while continuing to vilify and
shun South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of Clinton's policies contend that this approach  has damaged
relations with an important ally, South Korea. They  also insist that progress
in the North-South dialogue should be linked  to implementation of the Framework
Agreement. America has a  vital interest in deterring a North Korean attack on
the South  an  interest that has not been given adequate attention by the
Clinton  Administration. North Korea's million-man army stands only a  few miles
away from the South Korean capital of Seoul and the  37,000 U.S. troops near the
North-South border. Reducing this  conventional military threat from the North
should be equally as  important as eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear weapons
potential.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On Japan, the issue dividing Clinton and his opponents is how  best to
sustain and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while  advancing deregulation and
the further opening of Japan's markets.  Critics argue that Bill Clinton made
two fundamental mistakes in  his policy toward Japan: He put economics and trade
at the center  of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and he attempted to use a highly 
confrontational managed-trade strategy to force internal change  in Japan.
Neither policy worked. Clinton's November 1994 and  June 1995 trade deals with
Japan did little to open Japan's market  to U.S. goods; instead they damaged
U.S.-Japan military alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S.-Japan security alliance remains the key to peace  and prosperity in
Asia. Relations with Japan must be managed  with this fact in mind. This is a
realization Bill Clinton came to  only belatedly. In 1995, the Pentagon, under
the leadership of  Assistant Secretary Joseph Nye, undertook a major initiative
aimed  at strengthening the alliance; at the same time, the Clinton trade  team
backed off from its confrontational approach. Managed trade is  not the answer
to the trade deficit with Japan; it only reinforces  the clout of bureaucratic
elements hostile to free trade. A far  better approach, Clinton's critics
maintain, is for the U.S. to  support forces inside Japan advocating
deregulation and the further  opening of Japan's market. These are America's
allies inside Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On trade in Asia, the issue is whether the U.S. will or will not  take the
lead in opening up Asian markets to U.S. goods and  services. Bill Clinton
claims to support trade liberalization in Asia, but  he leaves the heavy lifting
to others. In 1994, the President agreed  to work with leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum to create an Asia-Pacific
free-trade area by the  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  2020. But at an APEC meeting in
Tokyo last year, he not  only failed to show up; he also left the U.S.
delegation without  authority to make substantial commitments on his behalf.
Critics  believe the President's commitment to APEC and free trade in Asia  is
lukewarm and largely rhetorical. To advance free trade and  American prosperity,
they believe, the President should ask Congress  for &quot;fast-track&quot;
authority to negotiate free-trade agreements in  Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major issue in Southeast Asia is how to respond to rising  instability
in Cambodia, where Bill Clinton has failed to use the  leverage provided by U.S.
economic assistance to advance  American interests. Indifferent to Washington's
diplomatic protests, the  government of Cambodia has proceeded to ban political 
opposition parties, attack press freedoms, and even assassinate  journalists.
Critics of the President argue that the U.S. should not tolerate  such assaults
on the democratically elected government in  Cambodia and that future U.S.
economic assistance must depend  on Cambodia's respect for democratic freedoms
and human rights.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Asia is the home of the world's most dynamic and

<P><B>*</B>     Exports to Asia in 1994 totaled more than $153 billion, with 
the nations of the region purchasing $45 billion more from  American companies
than the 15 nations of the European Union and  $30 billion more than Europe as a
whole. In 1994, more than 3  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Americans owed their jobs to U.S.
exports to Asia, and of these  3 million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in
1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The most immediate threat to U.S. security interests comes 
from North Korea's enduring hostility toward South Korea, a U.S.  ally. During
the 1970s and 1980s, North Korea pursued a nuclear  weapons development program,
now frozen under the 1994  Framework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea.
North  Korea's graphite-moderated reactors have produced between 7 and 22 
kilograms of plutonium, enough for from 2 to 6 nuclear devices.  In addition,
North Korea has an active missile development  program; its Soviet-made <I>SCUD
</I>ballistic missiles are capable of  reaching Seoul, the capital of the
Republic of Korea, and even  threatening U.S. forces stationed in Japan. And its
million-man  conventional army remains deployed within 26 miles of Seoul. South 
Korean active-duty forces number approximately 650,000; U.S. forces  in the
Republic of Korea number approximately 37,000, forward  deployed mostly along
the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      A second major threat to U.S. security interests arises  from
China's aggressive behavior. In February 1995, the Chinese  navy occupied
Mischief Reef, an atoll in the South China Sea  well within the Philippines'
Exclusive Economic Zone, which is  internationally recognized by the Law of the
Sea Convention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Against the Republic of China on Taiwan, Beijing has conducted
 a campaign of military intimidation in response to the visit to  the United
States of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. This  campaign was highlighted by
Beijing's testing of nuclear-capable  intermediate range ballistic missiles 100
miles north of Taiwan.  Six test firings of these missiles took place on July
21-26 1995.  On 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  March 8, 1995, China fired three
test M-9 missiles into two  zones astride Taiwan's largest ports and near
international sea and  air lanes. The M-9 missile can carry conventional,
chemical,  or nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In l978, the U.S. diplomatically recognized the People's 
Republic of China as the sole government of China. However, the U.S.  has
maintained unofficial relations with the Republic of China on  Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA  has allowed the U.S. to maintain
commercial, educational,  cultural, and defense  but not diplomatic  relations
with Taiwan.  The U.S. acknowledges that Beijing claims a &quot;One-China 
policy,&quot; which the PRC interprets as including sovereignty over  Taiwan,
but the U.S. does not officially recognize the legitimacy of  this claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan held its first democratic 
presidential elections on March 23, 1996. President Lee Teng-hui  was elected in
an overwhelming victory, despite weeks of  Chinese threats and saber-rattling.
This was the first democratic election  of a leader in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan, like the PRC, has made clear 
its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This body was set
up in 1995 under the auspices of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. Thus far, however,  neither the ROC nor the PRC has met the requirements
for WTO  membership.

goods and services from the U.S. than the United Kingdom and  Germany 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  combined. Japan imported some $70
billion in goods and  services from the U.S. in 1994, supporting 1.4 million
American jobs.  Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan is made up of 
manufactured goods, which support 840,000 American jobs. Japan is  America's
largest overseas market for agricultural products.

in Japan and the Republic of Korea are committed  to the defense of U.S. allies
and to the protection of American  interests in the region.1  U.S. forces in
Okinawa also are an  integral part of this commitment. Japan provides some $4
billion in  host nation support for U.S. forces and another $1 billion in a 
facilities improvement program. ROK cost-sharing is $330 million for  1996 and
will increase to $400 million by 1998.

</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDA">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in Asia is one of  confusion and failed
leadership. In a startling admission, Clinton's own  Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston  Lord, in 1994 said that the
Administration's Asia policies have  produced an &quot;emerging malaise&quot; 
an environment in which &quot;Asian  and others view us as placating domestic
special interest groups  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  criticize us for tactics that
destabilize relationships which are  central to the region's peace and 
prosperity.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt17.htm#1">1</A>  Unfortunately,
the mid-course corrections which Lord called for have not been  made. As a
result, the danger of lost influence has only increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Risking Alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The Clinton
Administration's Japan policy, focused initially on  efforts to manage trade,
has been acrimonious and counterproductive.  In 1993-1995 talks with the
Japanese, the Clinton trade team  demanded that the Japanese government accept
numerical targets  or indicators to ensure that the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan would  be reduced. While taking constructive steps toward deregulation, 
the Japanese government successfully resisted the U.S. demand  for enforceable
targets. After denying that its confrontational  trade policies were harming the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the  Administration, led by the Pentagon, in 1995 belatedly
engaged in a damage  limitation effort to reaffirm the alliance. Known as the
Nye  Initiative, after then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, this 
undertaking publicly highlighted the importance of the security  relationship
with Japan. But U.S. relations with Japan received  another blow in late 1995
when, citing domestic priorities during the  November budget negotiations with
Congress, the President  canceled a scheduled trip to Tokyo which was supposed
to be the  centerpiece of this campaign to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan  alliance.
Clinton's Asian advisors had warned that shunning the  Japanese would amount to
&quot;a body-blow&quot; to the alliance. To patch up  relations, Clinton
scheduled a summit with the Japanese in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another key relationship in Asia has been weakened by  the President's
policies toward the Republic of Korea. A  democracy and free-market economy,
South Korea is a military ally of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  United States. This alliance is
aimed at Communist North  Korea, which remains focused on uniting the Korean
peninsula under  its leadership. In addition to the threat of its million-man
army,  North Korea has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. The Clinton Administration struck a  diplomatic bargain
with North Korea in October 1994 to freeze  its nuclear program in exchange for
internationally financed and  constructed light water reactors. Thus was born
the U.S.-North  Korean Agreed Framework, which permits North Korea to put off
for  at least five years international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
These inspections are required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty  of 1968, to
which North Korea is a signatory. So far, North Korea  has honored its
commitments in the Framework Agreement and  maintained the freeze on its
reactors, but it remains to be seen  whether it will do so in the future. And
the fact remains that North  Korea was able to extract concessions from the U.S.
in exchange for  doing what it already was obligated to do under international
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest casualty of the Framework Agreement  has been the trust
and confidence of America's South Korean allies.  In reaching its nuclear
bargain with North Korea, the Clinton  Administration marginalized the input and
role of South Korea in the  negotiations. Indicative of the Clinton
Administration's  diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula, recent opinion polls by
the  United States Information Agency show South Korean support  for America's
military presence in the ROK at 72 percent, down  10 percent from 1994. In
addition, overall opinion of the U.S. is  down and, for the first time in 12
years, more unfavorable (53  percent) than favorable (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the record shows, America's Asian alliances, which are key  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  protecting commerce and U.S.
security interests, have been  weakened by feckless and myopic Administration
leadership. No  one can say whether such damage is permanent, but four more
years  of these policies could set the stage for a general retreat of U.S. 
influence and power from Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Misguided China Policy. </B>After campaigning in 1992  to link
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China to  its human rights record,
President Clinton reversed himself in  1994 and, two months after the Chinese
leadership had publicly  humiliated the Secretary of State during his March
visit to  Beijing, dropped its human rights demands and supported MFN for 
China. This was the correct decision, but the Administration's  ill-conceived
linkage strategy forced it into a series of policy retreats  and flip-flops
which have undermined U.S. credibility throughout  the region.<A
HREF="ftnt17.htm#2">2</A>  More and more, America's word in
Asia has come  to matter less and less.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the best example was the Administration's mishandling  of ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in  June 1995. At first, the
Clinton Administration caved in to  Beijing's protests and resisted granting a
visa so that Taiwan's President  Lee could pay an unofficial visit to his alma
mater, Cornell  University. Agreeing with Beijing, the Administration argued
that granting  a visa would violate its &quot;One-China&quot; policy. However,
in  response to nearly unanimous congressional condemnation of its  decision,
the Administration relented and permitted President Lee to make  a private visit
to Cornell last June. While the decision to let  President Lee visit the U.S.
was the right one, it should have been  made at the beginning. The ROC should
have been spared this  painful ordeal that angered all involved and undermined
U.S. credibility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In yet another misstep, the Clinton Administration in  February 1995
mishandled the Chinese navy's occupation of Mischief  Reef in the South China
Sea. Mischief Reef is a small atoll well  within the Philippines' 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, but it is in  an area also claimed by China, Taiwan,
and Vietnam. It took  the Clinton Administration three months to respond to this
breach  of international law, and even then it could muster only a mild 
diplomatic protest. In addition to the Mischief Reef episode, China  decided to
express disapproval of U.S. support for President  Lee's visit by conducting
large-scale military maneuvers, including  the firing of nuclear-capable
missiles, in the vicinity of Taiwan.  Only after the Chinese launched these
missiles near two Taiwanese  ports on March 8, 1995, did the Clinton
Administration belatedly  take action, dispatching two aircraft carriers to the
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The President's ineffectual and delayed reactions have  cost America much
in lost prestige and credibility in Asia. The  ROC feels more threatened, the
PRC more emboldened, and the  entire region of Asia more uncertain, not only
about China's  intentions, but also about America's credibility and staying
power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Half-Hearted Support for Asia-Pacific Free Trade. The  Clinton
Administration's record on advancing U.S. trade interests in  Asia is mixed. In
1994, the President joined other leaders of the  Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in declaring his  support for the idea of a free-trade
and investment area in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. This is a
worthy goal, but then  the President failed to attend the 1995 APEC meeting in
Tokyo,  which focused on developing a blueprint for implementing the 1994 
declaration. In addition, the U.S. delegation came without the  fast-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  track negotiating authority
needed for the U.S. to move  ahead more quickly with a free-trade agenda, and
U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor threw roadblocks in the way of gaining 
fast-track authority from Congress. Kantor, for example, refused  to compromise
when Congress opposed environmental and labor  provisions that the President
wanted included in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Failure to Defend the U.S. Investment in Cambodian  Democracy. The U.S. is
in danger of losing its $500 million investment in  the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. In  May 1993, the Cambodian people voted
freely for a government to  be led by non-communist political parties. However,
the  communist Cambodian People's Party (CCP), installed by Vietnam in  1979,
bullied its way into a coalition with the non-communists.  While claiming
Cambodia as one of its supposed diplomatic success  stories, the Clinton
Administration has failed to censure the  government of Cambodia as it has
proceeded to attack press  freedoms, assassinate journalists, and ban opposition
political parties.

proliferation  of missiles and missile technology into the Persian Gulf and 
South Asia; and 4) respect for human rights by China. America  should assume
neither China's friendship nor its hostility. By  sustaining Asian alliances,
clearly defining interests and priorities  toward China, and measuring China's
actions against them, America  can judge the nature of Beijing's intentions and
adopt appropriate  policies. Once these policies are adopted, Washington needs

told that the degree to which it will be  respected and integrated into the
international economic and political  community depends on how well it abides by
international rules  and standards.

world's most  vibrant economies, but also a democracy.

terms and conditions of the Framework agreement.  In particular, it must
continue the freeze on its nuclear  program. Should the North restart its
plutonium-producing reactors or fail  to allow inspections of the facilities
agreed to under the terms of  the Framework, the U.S. should build an
international coalition to  support sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand opportunities for greater American trade with Asia.</B> 
The United States should explore with Australia, New Zealand,  Chile, and
Singapore the possibility of their accession to the  North American Free Trade

South Korea and Japan, while China's tactical and  strategic missile arsenal is
a threat to the security of the entire  Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. should
equip its own ground and  naval forces with missile defense systems and then
offer to sell  those systems to key allies and friends. Missile defense should

The Clinton Administration's approach to trade with Japan is based  on using
external pressure to force internal change. This  approach was confrontational
from the outset, and it has not worked.  More

military alliance with Japan. A  more effective approach would be to recognize
that change in Japan  is internally driven, and align U.S. trade and economic 
objectives with reformers inside Japan who advocate deregulation and a  further
opening of Japanese markets. For example, the U.S.  should propose a
deregulation summit to Japan, aimed at producing  commitments to an action plan.

<P><B>Q. Why does the United States still need to maintain a large  military

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The end of the Cold War has not ended threats to peace in  Asia.
North Korea's large conventional military force and its  nuclear program pose a
direct threat to South Korea and Japan, both  of which are U.S. allies. China's
rapid military buildup and its  willingness to use force to pursue territorial
claims in the South  China Sea and against Taiwan also are cause for concern. 
America's military presence in Asia has been reduced significantly  since 1990,
but it remains large enough at its current 100,000-man  level to deter possible
threats. American forces in Japan and South  Korea receive significant financial
support from their host  countries. By helping to preserve peace, the U.S. is
helping Asians  and Americans alike to become more prosperous.

<P><B>A.</B> By pressing to reduce trade barriers, both within Asia and 
between the United States and Asia, Americans will benefit from  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  jobs created by economic growth.
More U.S. exports mean  more American jobs. In 1994, U.S. exports to Asia grew
at a rate of  16 percent, totaling over $153 billion. In that same year, more
than  3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.  Of these 3
million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in  1994 alone. In addition,
greater prosperity in Asia reinforces  regional stability and strengthens the
democratic political evolution  underway in countries like Taiwan, South Korea,
and the  Philippines. Democracy and stability reduce the risk of armed conflict 
between states.

<P>
</P>
<P>The future of U.S.-Russian relations is uncertain. Much  depends on the
outcome of the presidential elections in Russia,  currently scheduled for the
summer of 1996. Among candidates for  the Duma (the lower house of the Russian
parliament) in the  December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their
allies  captured over 50 percent of the popular vote. President Boris  Yeltsin,
who declared his candidacy for the presidency in February 1996,  is trailing the
pack of presidential candidates. The most popular  candidate is Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the unreformed  Communist Party. Another dangerous contender
is Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  an anti-American ultra-nationalist. Victory for either
Zyuganov  or Zhirinovsky would seriously endanger Russia's young  democracy and
market reforms. A communist or extreme nationalist at  the helm could well put
the world's second-largest nuclear power on  a collision course with the United
States in Central Europe or  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  Middle East.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Yeltsin's own prospects look grim. His health is  failing, and
Russia's internal economic and political crisis continues  unabated. The war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya  and Russia's economic difficulties have
eroded the popularity  of Yeltsin's administration to the point where polls show
 approval ratings at around 10 percent to 15 percent. Moscow is awash  in rumors
of coups and falsified presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No one knows who will rule in Moscow by the end of 1996,  but the period of
romantic partnership with the U.S. and the West  is over. Russia is striking out
on its own, taking a path that  already has led to confrontation with the West.
In fact, Russia is in  the midst of a political turbulence fraught with dangers
for the  West, and the chances are good that the next American President  will
have to deal with a new and very different set of players in  Moscow.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major point of disagreement between President Clinton and  his U.S.
critics concerns the U.S. support for President Yeltsin.  Critics charge that
the Clinton Administration's continued  unquestioning support for Boris Yeltsin
makes less and less sense. According  to critics, Yeltsin today is presiding
over the return of the  hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power.
He has lost  the support of the Russian reformers and is pursuing an 
increasingly confrontational foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Anti-Western sentiments are growing in Russia. Moscow is  attempting to
re-establish its influence in neighboring regions  that once were part of the
Soviet Union. The Kremlin is  employing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  economic, diplomatic, and
military means to achieve a sphere  of economic and military influence in what
Moscow calls its  &quot;near abroad&quot;  the Baltic States, Ukraine, and the
non-Russian states  in Central Asia and the Caucasus that used to be part of the
 Soviet Union but became independent when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's critics believe that preventing the  emergence of a
Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union  should be a top Western
priority, both to help assure the development  and survival of Russian democracy
and to safeguard vital Western  interests. Moreover, an anti-Western policy
could lead Russia  to forge alliances with anti-Western forces in Iran, Iraq,
China,  and Libya. Yet, critics allege, the Clinton Administration has given 
the Russians a free ride in the &quot;near abroad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics of the Clinton Administration also claim that the U.S.  has turned a
blind eye to the atrocities in Chechnya. The President  and his aides have bent
over backwards not to offend President  Yeltsin as he has crushed the rebellion,
which so far has resulted in  over 30,000 deaths and more than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A critical concern is the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to  Iran. The
Islamic regime in Tehran has launched a bid to  acquire nuclear weapons. It is
buying two Russian-made nuclear  reactors capable of producing plutonium that
can be enriched to  become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. The
Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself does not support this sale, 
believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security.  Nevertheless,
the sale goes on, primarily because of pressure from the  powerful Russian
Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom) headed  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Victor Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is aid to Russia and the NIS  countries. Aid to
Russia has attracted bipartisan support, but this may  be weakening as Russia
becomes more anti-Western and  expansionist. The Bush and Clinton
Administrations have provided over  $4 billion in aid to Russia since 1992.
Combined aid monies  and loans to the former Soviet Union and Russia for 
1985-1995 amounted to over $100 billion. The results of these aid  programs have
been mixed; critics argue that U.S. aid programs often  disregard Russia's real
needs and are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also dividing President Clinton and his critics is NATO  expansion. The 1994
Contract With America stipulated that NATO  enlargement (to include Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech  Republic) should be a top national priority. However,
the Clinton  Administration has put NATO expansion on the back burner, both to 
secure Moscow's cooperation in peacekeeping in Bosnia and to  appease Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics charge also that the President is appeasing Yeltsin on  missile
defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans  the deployment of a
missile defense system from the U.S. The  Clinton Administration opposes
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and  wants to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty
to limit even shorter  range (tactical) missiles  something which it was not
originally  intended to do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another point of contention concerns conventional arms  control. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty places limits  on the numbers of
conventional weapons (such as tanks and  cannon) 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  in Europe and Russia. It was
signed with the now-defunct  U.S.S.R. in 1990 after more than two decades of
negotiations. Critics  became worried when Clinton agreed to a unilateral
revision of  the treaty that permitted the Russians to exceed agreed limits on 
conventional weapons in Russia's northern and southern states.  Beefing up the
numbers of tanks and cannon on the borders of  Russia's neighbors, be it the
Baltic States or nations in the Caucasus,  raises questions about Moscow's
long-term intentions. Moreover,  critics point out that Russia is already far
behind on meeting the  weapons system destruction targets stipulated by the CFE
agreement.

Soviet-era Russian parliament. The recalcitrant Supreme Soviet of Russia  had
become the site of intense opposition to Yeltsin and his  market reforms. After
a week-long standoff, Yeltsin ordered the  Russian military to fire on the
parliament building, called the  &quot;White

prospect of NATO's  eastward expansion has been shrill and hostile. Most Russian

<P><B>*</B>     Russia's unilateral violation of the CFE treaty, signed in 
1990, threatens other former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, the  Baltic

many more tanks, cannon, and other heavy  systems than was originally agreed.
This buildup also jeopardizes the  oil resources of the Caspian Sea and the

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has made relations with Boris Yeltsin too  personal. As
Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the  flames 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  of Russian resentment toward the
U.S. with his unequivocal  support of the Russian president, especially after
the dramatic  shooting at the parliament building in October 1993 and the 
beginning of the Chechen war. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived  by many in
the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically  supportive of
Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has  endangered the ability of
the U.S. to maintain a relationship  with segments of Russian society that
oppose President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration paid lip service to the idea of  enlarging NATO
to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. However, it has done very
little to make this happen. Critics  accuse the Administration of promising not
to expand NATO  in 1996 in exchange for Russia's cooperation on peacekeeping  in
Bosnia. Republican Members of Congress, who included  NATO expansion in their
Contract With America, generally are more  supportive of a rapid expansion of
NATO than the Clinton  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to  recognize the
importance of countries other than Russia. For example,  without Ukraine, the
Russian empire cannot be recreated and will  have only limited access to the
heart of Europe. Azerbaijan  controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia
is situated in a  strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. Nevertheless,
the  Clinton Administration has neglected these countries, promoting a  &quot;Russia-first&quot;
policy and recognizing Moscow's domination of  the &quot;near abroad.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has failed to prevent the sale  of nuclear
reactors to Iran, despite America's share in the  massive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  financial aid provided to Moscow
by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral
financial  institutions. The reactors are a vital component of the Iranian bid
to  acquire &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. assistance to the reform efforts in Russia and other  former Soviet
states has been poorly executed. Much of the $4.1 billion  in U.S. assistance
allocated to date has been wasted. The Bush  and Clinton Administrations erred
in choosing the U.S. Agency  for International Development as the main
implementing agency  for assistance. AID has its expertise in the developing
world, not  in post-communist transitional economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Russia and other New Independent States (NIS) have become  leading exporters
of crime, together with Colombia, Southeast  Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
others. Law and order in Russia have  collapsed, organized crime is merging with
legal government  structures, and it is difficult to say where the mafiosi end
and the  government begins. Many Russian and Eurasian criminal  organizations
operate internationally, including in the United States  and Western Europe.
Russian organized criminals and corrupt  officials have access to weapons and
technology of mass destruction,  including uranium, chemical and biological
weapons, and the  raw materials and components for their manufacture, as well as
 scientists with specific weapons-related expertise. Despite all of  this
evidence, the Clinton Administration has continued to hail the  success of
economic reforms in Russia, failing to raise the crime  and corruption issue in
bilateral talks with the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration championed the START II  nuclear arms reduction
treaty with Russia. The main obstacles to  START 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  II ratification are not in
Washington (the U.S. Senate ratified  the treaty on January 26, 1996) but in
Moscow, where a majority  of deputies in the newly elected Duma probably will
refuse to  ratify it. Objections have been raised based on America's presumed 
intention to build a missile defense, but the real reason for the  Russian
intransigence lies elsewhere: The Russian military  establishment wants to keep
large, land-based multiple-warhead  missiles, such as the SS-18, SS-19, and
especially the mobile SS-24.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weakest part of Clinton's arms control record concerns  the ABM Treaty.
Russia today claims to be the heir to the  now-defunct Soviet Union, and is
demanding that the U.S. abide by  the 1972 ABM treaty. The Administration not
only wants to abide  by the treaty, it wants to expand its scope. U.S.
negotiators  reportedly have accepted a Russian demand to limit the performance
of  the most promising U.S. short-range missile defenses. And  President Clinton
vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because  of its missile defense
provisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in conventional arms  control with the
Russians has not been much better. The  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty places limits on the numbers of  conventional weapons, such as tanks and
cannon, permitted in the  European theaters of operation. It was signed with the
U.S.S.R.  in 1990, and the U.S. agreed in 1995 to allow Russia to exceed  the
limits imposed by the CFE on weapons stationed on its  northern and southern
flanks. Russia's neighbors in the Baltic region or  the Caucasus are now more
insecure as the number of weapons  and tanks on the Russian border continue to
grow. This is  especially worrisome because of all the rhetoric in Moscow about 
restoring the Soviet Union. Moreover, Russia is far behind in meeting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  weapons system destruction
targets stipulated by the CFE.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Develop a Russian policy based on support for ideas
and  interests, not individual politicians.</B>  The U.S. should support
democracy  and free markets in Russia, as well as political forces advocating 
these ideas, not controversial individual politicians like Boris  Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure  in bringing
about the collapse of Soviet communism. Today,  however, today some of his
policies and his personal style are  extremely controversial, and his popularity
is plummeting.  Moreover, there are other reform-oriented politicians in Russia 
with whom a dialogue should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Advocate broad-based cooperation with Russia and
other  NIS members to ensure their integration into global markets and  the
democratic community of nations.</B> The U.S. should continue  selective and
targeted technical assistance programs and provide  support to pro-democracy
forces and nascent market institutions in  the NIS. The U.S. must design and
implement trade, investment,  and assistance programs for Russia and the NIS
that reduce  inflation, lower market barriers, and stimulate growth. Thriving
Russian  and Eurasian markets would create jobs and export opportunities  for
American businesses. U.S. assistance programs should be  taken away from AID and
given to an independent board  of policymakers, area specialists, and business
representatives.  Such a board can be appointed jointly by the President and
Congress.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's interference in the affairs of its
neighbors.  The survival, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all NIS 
countries are important to future peace and prosperity in Eurasia.</B> The  U.S.
should support the independence of Ukraine, Azerbaijan,  Georgia, and the
Central Asian states, many of which are being drawn  unwillingly back into the
Russian orbit. Washington should  intensify its ties with Ukraine, the Baltic
States, and countries in  the Caucasus and Central Asia. The West should assist
them in  developing foreign and domestic policy decisionmaking bodies  and
mechanisms, training their bureaucracies, and increasing  security cooperation.
Technical assistance in privatization of industry  and agriculture also should
be provided.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's brutality in Chechnya.</B> The U.S.
should  make clear to Moscow that the use of force against other states or 
areas of the former Soviet Union could trigger U.S. retaliation  against Russian
economic and political interests. While the U.S.  should support the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation, the  West should oppose the brutal methods
of the Russian military in  handling internal dissent, such as those used in
Chechnya. The  Clinton Administration should stop issuing declarations of
support  for Russia's actions in Chechnya and instead support OSCE efforts  to
resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully. The OSCE should  undertake a high-profile
mission to Chechnya and Russia. If Russia is to  integrate into the world
community, it must abide by its rules of  conduct, including international law
and custom. Washington  should clarify to Russia that aggressive military action
against her  neighbors could result in international isolation and possible 
economic sanctions. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Not allow Moscow to veto the opening of NATO to new 
members.</B> The U.S. should maintain a constant dialogue with Russia  on NATO
expansion, pointing out possibilities for  Russian-NATO cooperation and
stressing that NATO is not a threat to  Russian security. While NATO enlargement
will occur, Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program should
be expanded  simultaneously as appropriate to assuage Russian concerns. But 
under no circumstances should Moscow be allowed to prevent  sovereign countries
in East and Central Europe from joining the  NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Oppose Russia's policies of nuclear proliferation.</B>
The U.S.  should take every step to prevent Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states 
from gaining nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. For  example, voluntary
export controls similar to those developed by the  Coordination Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) regime during the Cold War could be
imposed on technology  sales to these countries. Pressure should be applied
against the arming  of rogue states, up to and including the imposition of
selective  economic sanctions. At the same time, Russia should be  encouraged to
pursue other less threatening commercial ventures, such as  commercial space
launches. These could bring about a voluntary  cancellation of the reactor deal.
The U.S. also should cooperate  with pro-Western circles in Turkey and
Azerbaijan to promote  democracy and oppose radical Islam in Eurasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assist Russia and other NIS countries in fighting organized  crime
and corruption. The U.S. could do this by helping the  Russians devise
comprehensive criminal and criminal procedure  codes.</B> Some of the leftover
Soviet laws in Russia make it difficult to  fight organized crime; for example,
there is no adequate law against  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  conspiracy to commit a crime. In
addition, U.S. law  enforcement agencies should cooperate with trustworthy and
reliable law  enforcement personnel in the East. In particular, they can assist 
in developing a witness relocation program. They should strive  to track and
penetrate Russian and NIS criminal rings dealing  in weapons of mass destruction
and narcotics. Finally, American  law enforcement agencies should monitor
East-West financial  transactions more closely. Deposits that originate in the
NIS should  be carefully screened and the legitimacy of earnings established.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Reject Russian demands for broadening the ABM
Treaty.</B> The  U.S. needs to be defended against missile launches by rogue
states  and terrorists and against accidental launches. The Clinton 
Administration and the Russians are attempting to extend the life of the  ABM
Treaty by designating Russia and other states as successors to  the Soviet Union
under the treaty and broadening its scope to  cover theater missile defense
systems. Ballistic missile defense is a  vital goal for the U.S. These moves by
Clinton and the Russians  therefore should be resisted firmly. The ABM Treaty
needs to be  eliminated, not extended or broadened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&AR">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should we provide aid to Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The window of opportunity for the West in Russia may be  closing.
While there is still time, we should provide aid that  strengthens free markets
and free minds. Communism worked to  destroy both of these for 70 years. Many
Russians still want to learn  about democracy and capitalism, and we should
provide them with  a fighting chance before it is too late. However, we must
ensure  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  the aid is used wisely. Aid to
Russia needs to be customized  for Russian conditions. If a hard-line government
were to take over  in Russia, making U.S. aid meaningless or worse, we probably 
would have to cut off all aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What do we do if hard-liners take Yeltsin's place?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should act now to strengthen relations with all countries  in
the region, which will be threatened even more than the West  if hard-liners
come to power in Moscow. We should expand  NATO to include Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and  perhaps Slovakia, and should prevent any U.S. or
international  assistance to Moscow if an aggressive, anti-American, or
anti-Western  government emerges. Even under these severe circumstances, 
however, the U.S. should maintain a dialogue with Moscow,  clarifying what price
Russia may pay if &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed. Eventually,  if the need
arises, we may need to plan for military  contingencies and even to contain
Russia if it becomes aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't NATO expansion endanger Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. NATO enlargement is aimed at creating a zone of  stability
and security in Eastern and Central Europe. Opening NATO  to new members 
something which has happened repeatedly in  the past  will hasten the
integration of the Czech Republic,  Poland, Hungary, and other new members into
the West. NATO is a  defensive alliance, and its posture in Central Europe
should remain  defensive.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why shouldn't we be more cooperative with Russia?  After  all, the
Cold War is over. Russia is a democracy and a great  power. Why shouldn't we
allow Moscow a greater role in policing  unstable regions, such as the Caucasus
or Central Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We can cooperate with reformers in Russia who are  interested in
building a market economy and democracy. It will take  time, however, to assess
whether democracy has taken root in  Russia. Russia will always have a
considerable role in the region  because of its sheer size and economic,
political, and cultural weight,  but there are forces in Russia that dream of
re-establishing the  Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. These anti-Western and 
anti-American forces desire to expand Russia's power and influence to  compete
with the West, not cooperate with it. We should  oppose Russia's heavy-handed
interference in the affairs of its  neighbors and attempts to violate their
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In view of Chechnya, what should the U.S. do to prevent  Russia from
invading its neighbors?  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should enhance our relations with Ukraine, the  Baltic States,
and countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. There  are as many people in
these countries as there are in Russia.  We should draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot;
and stick to them. For example,  we should warn Moscow that we will block all
IMF and World  Bank assistance if an NIS country is invaded, and that the U.S.
will  lead the international diplomatic campaign to restore the  independence of
a violated country. If Russia crosses these lines, we should  consider imposing
both restrictions on exchanges and economic  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  trade sanctions against Russia.
We also should demand from  Moscow that the war in Chechnya stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are democracy and reform the causes of crime in Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is widespread crime and corruption in Russia, and  some
Russians mistakenly think that the cause of crime is  free-market capitalism.
Crime is rampant, of course, but because there is  no rule of law in Russia.
Moreover, real democracy barely exists,  and the country still has a long way to
go before a free-market  system is fully established. Free markets mean the rule
of law, not the  rule of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is Russian organized crime a threat to U.S. and Western  security?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, because Russian criminals are very sophisticated, 
well-educated, and well-connected worldwide. They often boast  advanced college
degrees, as well as KGB and special forces  training. There is great potential
danger in the merger of former  communist, KGB, and criminal elements in Russia
and the NIS,  and the threat from the possible access of organized criminals to 
weapons of mass destruction is particularly acute.

<a href="iran.gif">Map 4</a>: Iran Remains a Long-Term Threat to U.S. Interests in the Gulf<br>
<a href="israel.gif">Map 5</a>: Israel and Syria: At Odds Over the Golan Heights<P>
<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESP">THE ISSUES</A></B>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf is the strategic storehouse of roughly 55  percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.S. cannot allow hostile  powers such as Iran or Iraq
to gain hegemony over Persian Gulf oil  supplies. This would allow them to gain
an economic stranglehold  on oil-importing states and could fuel a military
buildup that  includes weapons of mass destruction. The issue is how best to
contain  Iran and Iraq. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator  Alfonse
D'Amato (R-NY) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  (R-GA), have pushed for a
hard-line policy of aggressive  containment of Iran and the stiffening of
economic sanctions against it, but  the Administration has dragged its feet. On
Iraq, the  Administration came to office prepared to improve relations with
Baghdad if  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein behaved himself, but Saddam's 
repeated provocations have convinced the Administration that the U.S.  must
contain Iraq vigilantly and firmly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the many cleavages that  threaten the
stability of the region, has been muted substantially but  still poses a threat
to the security of Israel and moderate  pro-Western Arab regimes. A renewal of
this conflict also could help fan  the flames of Islamic radicalism and lead to
an upsurge in  international terrorism. The issue is how to help advance 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Clinton Administration has pushed for  a
peace treaty between Israel and Syria. It has offered to  deploy American
peacekeeping forces on the Golan Heights, following  an Israeli military
withdrawal from that strategic border area,  to monitor compliance with a
possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.  A growing chorus of conservatives
questions the wisdom of an  open-ended U.S. peacekeeping commitment on the Golan
Heights  which could divert U.S. military forces from other missions, erode 
military readiness, and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist attacks  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  Middle Eastern terrorist groups
opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third issue is how to help contain the rising tide of Islamic  radicalism
that threatens to sweep away the Algerian military  regime and undermine
pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Jordan,  Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey.
Islamic radicals also threaten  U.S. interests by promoting international
terrorism and opposing  the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Clinton
Administration has  established diplomatic contacts with Islamic radicals and
has called  for a political dialogue between them and the states they seek to 
overthrow. Many conservatives oppose such contact because it  undermines secular
Middle Eastern regimes that the radicals seek  to overthrow, makes it easier for
Islamic radicals to seize power,  and would not change their anti-Western
policies if they did come  to power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSP">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains a dangerous, albeit 
weakened, threat to regional stability. The Iraqi army remains the  strongest
regional military force in the Persian Gulf region, and  Iraq continues its
efforts to build weapons of mass destruction, such  as chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein  will remain a threat to Western interests in
the Persian Gulf as long  as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran looms large as the principal long-term threat to U.S. 
interests in the Persian Gulf. It has launched a massive military buildup  and
continues to support terrorism against its neighbors and  Western countries,
including the U.S. It also has sought to intimidate  the Arab emirates across
the Persian Gulf by rattling its saber. In  1992 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  Iran seized three disputed
islands at the mouth of the Persian  Gulf and fortified them with 8,000 troops,
chemical weapons,  anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran, like Iraq, has launched a clandestine program to build 
nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian nuclear power program.  Russia,
China, and Pakistan have provided technology, equipment,  or training that could
help advance Iran's nuclear weapons  program. Western companies, including many
from Germany, have  sold Iran dual-use (civilian/military) technologies that
could aid  its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>    The Arab-Israeli peace negotiations achieved the October  1994
Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, but Syrian-Israeli negotiations  have been
deadlocked by Syrian intransigence. The  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have
lurched along through two interim  self-rule agreements that have led to an
unstable, uneasy peace  continually undermined by persistent terrorism from
Palestinian Islamic  radicals. The most difficult issues  borders, Palestinian 
statehood, security arrangements, Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, 
Palestinian refugees, and water resources  have been relegated to  the final
status talks, set to begin in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Islamic radicals form a tiny majority of the world's more than
 900 million Muslims. They pose a threat primarily to secular  regimes in the
Muslim world, which they have not had a great deal of  success in overthrowing.
But when they seize control of a state,  as they did in Iran in 1979 or Sudan in
1989, their power to  threaten U.S. interests greatly increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. has suffered repeated terrorist attacks from Islamic 
radi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  cals, including the 1979-1981
hostage crisis, the 1983 bombing  of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the 1983
bombing of the U.S.  embassy in Lebanon, the kidnappings of 15 Americans in 
Lebanon between 1985 and 1991, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  in New York
City, and numerous other incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Algerian Islamic militants have waged a bloody civil war that 
has killed roughly 40,000 Algerians since the Army intervened  in January 1992
to oust the discredited National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDP">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has done a mediocre job of  consolidating the
benefits of the Bush Administration's Desert Storm  victory and protecting
Western interests in the Persian Gulf against  Iranian and Iraqi aggression. It
has done marginally better at assisting  in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations but
also has offered to  commit American peacekeeping forces to a risky open-ended 
deployment on the Golan Heights if Israel signs a peace treaty with Syria.  The
Administration has fared worst of all in its policy toward  Islamic radicals.
For example, the Clinton Administration's May  1993 &quot;Dual Containment&quot;
policy, which calls for the simultaneous  containment and isolation of Iraq and
Iran, takes a passive approach  to containing these two countries unless prodded
by Iraqi  provocations or concerned members of the U.S. Congress. Another 
example: Clinton in June 1993 ordered an attack by  Tomahawk cruise missiles
against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's  secret police in retaliation for the
failed April 1993 Iraqi-sponsored  assassination attempt against former
President George Bush in  Kuwait. But this was a mere slap on the wrist in view
of the  grave nature of the terrorist attack against a former American head  of

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on  increasing pressure on
Iran to halt its support of terrorism. Clinton on  April 30, 1995, announced the
signing of an executive order banning  all U.S. trade with Iran, but he did so
in part to prevent the U.S.  Congress from going farther and placing an import
ban on any  foreign company that continued to trade to Iran. The Administration 
feared this would create tensions with U.S. allies in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress has tried to strengthen America's policy toward  Iran. Led by
Senator D'Amato, the Senate passed a bill on December  21 that would punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil  industry. The House is likely to
pass this measure. House  Speaker Gingrich also forced the Administration to
toughen its policy  on Iran by insisting that the intelligence authorization
bill include  $18 million to support covert actions against the Iranian 
government by Iranian opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the Clinton Administration's policies toward Iraq and Iran  have been
unsuccessful, its role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations has been
overrated. President Clinton hosted  Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremonies at
the White House in September 1993  and September 1995, but the interim
Palestinian self-rule  agreements signed at those two ceremonies came about
through bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, not through U.S. diplomatic
 efforts. In October 1993, the Administration pledged to provide $500  million
in foreign aid to the Palestinians over five years. In 1994  Congress passed the
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act requiring  the State Department to certify
each year that the Palestine  Liberation Organization had complied with its
commitments under the  treaty 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  before this aid could be
disbursed. Representative  Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House
International  Relations Committee, has denounced the State Department
compliance  reports as a &quot;whitewash.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yielding to pressure from Congress, the President signed into  law a bill
requiring that the U.S. move its embassy in Israel from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, by May 31, 1999. The  legislation contains a provision that
permits the President to delay  the embassy move if he considers it harmful to
U.S. national  security interests. The Clinton Administration had opposed the
bill,  arguing that it would upset the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which 
include conflicting claims to Jerusalem, but the embassy would  be located in
Western Jerusalem, which is not claimed by the PLO.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To facilitate the negotiation of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty,  the Clinton
Administration has offered to dispatch a U.S.  peacekeeping force to the Golan
Heights, strategic territory along the  Syrian-Israeli border which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six Day War  and which Syria demands be returned to its
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has been much more active than  previous
administrations in establishing diplomatic contacts with  Islamic radicals, such
as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in  Algeria. This is dangerous because it
undermines confidence in  secular governments battling Islamic movements,
thereby helping  these movements come to power. The Clinton Administration has 
called for a political dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian  military
regime. It believes that the FIS can halt terrorism and enter  a power-sharing
arrangement with secular Algerian parties,  despite the fact that the FIS is
unable to control the more radical  Armed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Islamic Group which perpetrates
much of the terrorism in  the country and increasingly is eclipsing the FIS.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, 
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain a strong military presence in the Persian Gulf to  deter
Iran and Iraq from aggression and safeguard the free flow of  oil from the gulf
region.</B> Both countries have staged military  maneuvers in recent years to
intimidate their smaller neighbors. The  U.S. needs to maintain strong air and
naval forces in the region, as  well as pre-positioned military supplies that
can be deployed rapidly  by air transport to equip ground troops in a crisis.
Kuwait and  Qatar have agreed to provide facilities for pre-positioned military 
equipment, but the Saudi government has refused American requests  for a similar
arrangement in Saudi Arabia because it fears that  Islamic militants will
denounce such an arrangement as an American  base. Given such local political
sensitivities, the U.S. must seek to  limit the number of military personnel
stationed on the ground in  Saudi Arabia while depending on naval and air units
deployed in the  region to deter aggression from Iraq and Iran and relying on
rapid  air and sea transport to bring ground troops to the region in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq as long  as
Saddam Hussein remains in power, if necessary by vetoing  any move in the
Security Council to lift the sanctions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Tighten economic sanctions against Iran and press the  European
allies and Japan to stop lending money to Iran or renegotiating  its foreign
debt.</B> Iran is having increasing difficulty in financing  its 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  roughly $30 billion foreign debt.
The stagnant Iranian  economy has been plagued by government mismanagement and
by  continued low prices for oil, its principal export. The U.S. ban on  trade
with Iran has cut into Iran's export earnings but has had  limited impact
because Japan and Western European states continue  their policy of &quot;constructive
engagement&quot; with Iran, which amounts  to business as usual. Washington
should press its allies to join  the embargo on trade with Iran and halt their
efforts to help Iran  reschedule its debt until the regime ends its support of
terrorism  and Islamic revolution. Washington should make a point of 
publicizing Iranian involvement in terrorism and subversion to  embarrass
Western leaders that turn a blind eye to Iranian aggression. If  the allies
continue to neglect the Iranian threat, the U.S. should  impose trade sanctions
on Western companies that continue to do  business with Iran. Banning such
companies from selling their goods in  the United States would force them to
choose between the  American market and the smaller Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Pressure Russia, China, and Pakistan to halt their support of 
Iran's nuclear power program, which is being used as cover for  Iran's
clandestine nuclear weapons program.</B> These countries have  signed agreements
to provide nuclear technology, equipment, or  training to Iran. The U.S. should
increase pressure on all three countries  to break off their nuclear cooperation
with Tehran or risk U.S.  economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Take a cautious, go-slow approach to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations.</B> Washington should demand that the PLO comply with  its past
commitments, especially to fight terrorism and revoke  provisions in the
Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call  for the destruction of
Israel. The U.S. should not pressure Israel  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  make any concessions in the final
status talks, which begin in  May 1996, but should allow the two sides to work
out their  differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Withdraw the offer to deploy U.S. peacekeeping forces on  the
Golan Heights. If peacekeeping forces are needed to monitor  a Syrian-Israeli
peace treaty, they can be drawn from other  nations, as is the present United
Nations peacekeeping force on the  Golan Heights.</B> American forces should not
be used because they will  be a lightning rod for terrorist attacks by groups
based in  nearby Lebanon, such as the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah. If the 
forces deployed are too small, they will not significantly reduce the  military
risks that Israel would run in returning the heights to Syria;  if they are
large enough to deter Syrian aggression, they will  divert other U.S. military
units from more important missions and  erode U.S. military readiness by
interfering with combat training  schedules. For a Golan peacekeeping force to
be credible would  require the commitment of a heavy brigade of roughly 5,000
troops.  To maintain a long-term deployment would require the  commitment of
three brigades: one for deployment, one for retraining for  combat missions
after deployment, and one for training and  preparing to deploy. This represents
roughly 10 percent of the U.S.  Army's active duty combat strength, a
prohibitively high burden for  an open-ended peacekeeping commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Break off diplomatic contacts with the FIS and other radical 
Islamic groups.</B> Such contacts undermine the embattled secular  regimes
challenged by these radical groups. The U.S. also  should halt efforts to
pressure the embattled Algerian military regime  into a suicidal power-sharing
arrangement with Islamic radicals.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage free-market economic reforms, including the  development
of a European Union - North African free trade area, to  fuel economic growth in
North Africa and the Middle East.</B>  Economic reforms will create jobs for the
unemployed youth who serve  as the vanguard of Islamic revolutionary movements.
The U.S.  also should encourage the development of secular political parties 
that can give voice to political opposition and preclude Islamic  radicals from
monopolizing the opposition to established regimes.
</P>
<P>In addition, Congress should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Strengthen congressional oversight over the $100 million in 
annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians.</B> Congress should judge for  itself
whether the PLO has lived up to its peace commitments,  including its pledge to
end terrorism. Congress should withhold all U.S.  aid if the PLO fails to
comply.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. seek to maintain U.N. economic  sanctions on Iraq
when the Iraqi people, not the regime, appear to be  doing all the suffering?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.N. specifically exempted food and medicine from  its
embargo and gave Iraq the opportunity to export $1.6 billion  worth of oil to
pay for its imports if it did so under U.N.  supervision. Saddam Hussein
rejected this as an infringement of Iraqi  sovereignty and prefers to use the
suffering of his own people to  manipulate international public opinion. The
U.S. cannot afford to  lift the sanctions because Saddam has not complied with
U.N.  resolutions requiring that he provide a full accounting of his  military
buildup, recognize of the border with Kuwait, return Kuwaiti  hos
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  tages and assets, and halt
terrorism against his own people.  Moreover, Saddam remains a threat to the
region. If Iraq is allowed  to resume its oil exports, both Saddam's hold on
power and his  ability to threaten his neighbors will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be the U.S. role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Paradoxically, the U.S. should minimize its role as much  as
possible to encourage the Israelis and Arabs to negotiate with  each other, not
with Washington. Some of the biggest breakthroughs  in the peace negotiations,
such as Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat's 1977 visit to Jerusalem and the 1993
Oslo Accords, came  about without any direct U.S. involvement. Washington should
let  the two sides work out their problems by themselves to the  greatest extent
possible, suggesting ways to break diplomatic  impasses only when both sides
request that it do so. A lasting  Arab-Israeli peace must be negotiated
painstakingly by the parties to the  conflict and should not be imposed by
outside powers. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who has traveled to the
Middle East  17 times, should adjust his priorities and spend more time 
addressing more important issues, such as U.S. policy toward Russia  and China,
which he has visited less frequently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. reject a peacekeeping presence on  the Golan
Heights when it has maintained a similar  peacekeeping force in the Sinai
peninsula since 1982 to monitor compliance  with the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. forces would face a very different political, military,  and

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  terrorist threat environment in
the Golan Heights.  Peacekeepers would be deployed close to large armored
forces, in a  constricted area, and in positions that would become important
military  objectives if fighting erupts. Moreover, Golan peacekeepers could  be
subject to terrorist attacks from nearby Lebanon or from  terrorists hiding
among Syrian civilians. Finally, unlike Sadat's  Egypt, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
is one of the world's leading exporters  of terrorism. Syria supported
Hezbollah's terrorist attacks  against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
in 1983-1984 and  may be tempted to do so again in the Golan Heights to drive 
peacekeepers away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. By firmly opposing Islamic radicalism, can the U.S. be  accused of
being anti-Muslim?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. Muslims are the chief victims of Islamic  radicals,
who are totalitarian ideologues willing to use violence,  terrorism, and
intimidation to impose their narrow religious and  political views on their
countrymen. The U.S. has cooperated closely  with fundamentalist states such as
Saudi Arabia and President Zia  al-Haq's Pakistan. The U.S. is opposed to
terrorism and the export  of violent revolution, not to the religious beliefs of
any group.

</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has two vital national interests in Latin America:  countering such
ongoing threats to U.S. national security as illegal  drug trafficking and Fidel
Castro's Cuba and encouraging the  development of prosperous and stable
capitalist democracies  throughout 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Latin America's economies are among the fastest growing in  the world, and
the United States has been one of the principal  beneficiaries of this growth.
U.S. exports to Latin America more  than doubled between 1988 and 1994, rising
to $94 billion, and  now support over 2 million American jobs. Moreover,
democratic  reforms are advancing at a quicker pace in Latin America than 
anywhere else in the world. Today, Cuba is the only  undemocratic country in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Trade expansion drives U.S. relations with Latin America,  and NAFTA (the
North American Free Trade Agreement) will be  the main instrument for achieving
America's principal foreign  policy goals for the region. These goals consist of
expanding U.S.  exports and investment as quickly as possible and assuring
long-term  economic and political stability on America's southern flank, 
particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1989, the Bush Administration unveiled the Enterprise of  the Americas
Initiative, a bold proposal to create a single  free-trade area encompassing the
entire Western Hemisphere. The  following year, in 1990, the U.S. and Mexico
agreed to negotiate  NAFTA, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement ever
signed by  the U.S. with any Latin American country. NAFTA was signed  into law
by President Clinton on December 8, 1993. One year later,  at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, President Clinton and  33 other hemispheric heads of state
agreed unanimously to create  a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
President Clinton  also pledged at the summit to expand NAFTA to Chile in 1996,
but  that presidential promise has not yet been fulfilled.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most immediate threat to stability and security on  America's southern
flank is the crisis in Mexico. The peso's collapse on  December 19, 1994,
plunged Mexico into the worst economic  and political crisis it has suffered in
more than a century. The  peso crisis also weakened support for NAFTA in the
U.S. and may  have derailed further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Western 
Hemisphere for a period of two or three years. The Clinton  Administration is
aiding Mexico with a $50 billion emergency bailout  package, and the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo has  stepped up the pace of economic and political
reform, but the turmoil  will not subside quickly. It remains to be seen whether
the  Clinton Administration's bailout and the Zedillo government's  emergency
economic reforms will be enough to end the current crisis; if  not, Mexico will
be forced to implement even tougher reforms in  1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other threats to stability and security in Latin America  include
corruption, the widespread absence of the rule of law,  inadequate protection of
property rights, drug trafficking, organized  crime, and guerrilla activities in
several countries. These are  structural problems for which there are no easy or
quick solutions.  However, without sustained economic development, prospects for
 confronting these threats successfully are poor. The expansion of  NAFTA to
include Chile and other Latin American countries is the  vehicle proposed by the
U.S., and embraced by the emerging  capitalist democracies of Latin America, to
achieve sustained economic  development and create a 21st century hemispheric
partnership  based on free trade and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most important Latin American issues is whether  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 62 -->  include Chile in NAFTA. Some
American protectionists  oppose NAFTA's expansion, arguing that NAFTA caused the
 Mexican crisis and that free trade is bad for the United States. Others 
believe that expanding NAFTA is the only way to expand the  economies of the
U.S. and Latin America. Thus, they advocate  extending fast-track negotiating
authority to the President. Fast-track  negotiating authority authorizes the
President to conduct trade  negotiations with a view to achieving specific goals
established  by Congress. Agreements negotiated under fast-track are submitted 
to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but Congress may not amend  or otherwise
alter the proposed agreement submitted for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the U.S. should be bailing out  Mexico's economy.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration bailed out  Mexico with a rescue package
totaling nearly $50 billion. About half  of this amount has been borrowed by the
Mexican government so  far, yet the economic crisis has not ended. Critics of
the  Administration argue that it is both unwise and wasteful to  subsidize
Mexico's economic inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third important Latin American issue is whether the U.S.  should impose
sanctions on Colombia for not doing enough to curb  the drug cartels operating
in that country. President Ernesto  Samper financed his 1994 election campaign
with more than $6 million  in political contributions from the Cali cartel. In
1995, the  Clinton Administration renewed Colombia's annual certification with 
a &quot;national interest waiver,&quot; which is analogous to flunking a  final
exam but receiving a passing grade anyway. The Republican  majority in Congress
criticized Colombia's national interest  certification in 1995 and urged Clinton
instead to decertify Colombia  and impose trade sanctions. The Administration in
March 1996  decerti
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  fied Colombia as a sign of U.S.
opposition to the penetration  of Colombia's presidency, Congress, and court
system by  corrupt drug traffickers.

jobs. Total U.S. exports to all  countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1994
represented over 40 percent  of America's exports worldwide. The Western
Hemisphere  is America's second-largest export market, after Asia.

<P><B>*</B>     Negotiations for NAFTA were substantially concluded in 1992 
by the Bush Administration. The final agreement was approved  in 1993 by the
U.S. Congress, but only after the Clinton  Administration forced Mexico and
Canada to accept unnecessary side  agreements on labor and the environment.
NAFTA is to be  implemented over a period of 15 years, with full implementation
scheduled  for 2009. Chile is next in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Trade growth during NAFTA's first two years surpassed even 
the most optimistic forecasts. In 1994, two-way trade between the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 -->  and Mexico increased over 22
percent, to more than $100  billion. The U.S. reported a trade deficit of nearly
$16 billion with  Mexico during 1995, mainly because Mexican exports had
increased  by more than one-third since 1994. However, despite the peso  crisis,
U.S. exports to Mexico in 1995 fell by less than 9 percent from  the year
before, and were still higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The South American Common Market (Mercosur), which is led  by
Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is  rapidly
developing a free-trade area in South America while  seeking closer trade
relations with the European Union and several of  the APEC countries, including
Japan. If NAFTA is not  expanded quickly to include Chile, and subsequently
Argentina, the  U.S. may be sidelined from South American trade liberalization 
centered on Mercosur at the expense of American exports, jobs,  and U.S.
leadership in that region of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have become a  significant
threat to U.S. economic and security interests. Colombian  drug traffickers
financed the election of President Ernesto Samper  in 1994 and have penetrated
Columbia's Congress, courts, and  law enforcement institutions. Moreover, over
80 percent of the  cocaine imported illegally into the U.S. is transported
through Mexico  by powerful drug cartels in league with corrupt politicians, law
 enforcement, and military personnel. Belatedly, the Clinton  Administration
appears to have acknowledged that drug traffickers are  a national security
threat to America by appointing former  Army General Barry McCaffrey as the new
head of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The high watermarks of the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy toward
Latin America were the approval of NAFTA  in 1993 and the Summit of the Americas
in 1994. It was at this  conference that the President pledged to expand NAFTA
to  include Chile in 1996 and promised to create a Free Trade Area of  the
Americas by 2005. Both achievements were eclipsed by the  collapse of the
Mexican peso in 1995, and the crisis in Mexico  has derailed further U.S.-led
trade expansion in Latin America for  one or two years at least. The Clinton
Administration is  pretending otherwise, but without NAFTA's expansion to Chile,
the  President has nothing to offer Latin America, and the U.S. is  temporarily
sidelined from the process of hemispheric trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, with NAFTA's expansion pushed off  the Administration's
agenda, at least for now, President Clinton  has little to show for his efforts
in Latin America except a string  of foreign policy blunders. These include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The U.S. military occupation of Haiti.</B> President
Clinton  ordered the invasion of Haiti to establish a lasting democracy in that 
country. In truth, however, the Clinton Administration restored  Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and then  provided Aristide with over
$2 billion in military security and financial  aid as he consolidated his
one-man rule. New Haitian President  Rene Preval is Aristide's closest friend,
chosen by Aristide to  succeed him in power. Moreover, political violence has
continued in  Haiti since the start of the U.S. military occupation. Since
Aristide  was restored to power, more than 20 leaders of the political 
opposition have been murdered. Now that the U.S. has left Haiti, there  are
fears of renewed political violence.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The Mexican peso crisis.</B> The Clinton Administration had  more
than a year's advance warning, during 1993 and 1994, of  Mexico's impending
financial collapse but did nothing to prevent it.  When the crisis hit,
President Clinton rushed to the  Mexican government's rescue with a $50 billion
bailout package that  assured Americans holding Mexican government bonds of full
 repayment at the expense of American taxpayers. However,  the Mexican economy
suffered a brutal contraction that will be felt  for many years by the Mexican
people, and the expansion of  NAFTA to Chile and other Latin American countries
was derailed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Dealing secretly with Castro.</B> The White House secretly 
negotiated an agreement with Castro that requires U.S. Navy and Coast  Guard
ships to intercept Cuban refugees fleeing the island and  return them forcibly
to Cuba. However, Clinton obtained no economic  or political concessions from
Castro, except a promise not to  permit any new mass departures of Cubans
seeking freedom.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Latin America, the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Renew fast-track negotiating authority.</B> Without
fast-track,  the Administration cannot negotiate new trade agreements with 
Chile or any other countries. Fast-track is an essential tool for  American
trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Allow no more bailouts for Mexico or any other country.</B> 
Clinton's bailout of Mexico is a case of throwing good money after bad.  The
crisis in Mexico is not over. As soon as 1997, another peso  crisis 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 67 -->  could force the Zedillo
government to request more financial  aid from the U.S., and possibly also to
call for a new round of  debt negotiations to prevent a default. The U.S. should
refuse all  future Mexican requests for emergency financial bailouts and should 
urge Mexico instead to resolve its economic difficulties with  market-oriented
solutions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand NAFTA to include Chile.</B> Including Chile in  NAFTA would
send the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean a  strong message that U.S.
commitment to creating a Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA) remains firm.
It also would  enhance America's leadership in the Western Hemisphere while 
expanding export and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in  South
America, creating a South American gateway to Asian markets  for U.S. producers,
and strengthening the relative bargaining power  of U.S. trade negotiators in
future talks between NAFTA and  the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
headed by  Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Give Caribbean and Central American countries  NAFTA-level trade
parity.</B> Raising the countries of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative to NAFTA
parity with Mexico would not cost the U.S.  anything. To the contrary, it would
increase market access for U.S.  companies and investors in the Caribbean and
Central America  and would compel countries in the region to accept NAFTA 
standards in other areas beneficial to American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Negotiate a framework free-trade agreement between NAFTA  and
Mercosur, the South American Common Market.</B>  A  free-trade agreement between
NAFTA and Mercosur is an essential step  in creating a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. At present, Brazil  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  pursuing a policy of
consolidating Mercosur first in order to  create a South American Free Trade
Area (SAFTA), centered on  Brazil, that would exclude NAFTA initially. This
would have  adverse long-term consequences for U.S. exports and investments in 
South America. The U.S. should try to counter this Brazilian strategy  by
expanding NAFTA to include Chile, and subsequently  Argentina, in order to push
Mercosur toward a convergence with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Suspend all U.S. government aid to Haiti.</B> The Clinton 
Administration has withdrawn the American military presence from Haiti,  but it
plans to continue funding the Aristide-sponsored government  of President Rene
Preval with hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial aid disbursed through
the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) and multilateral
institutions like the  IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. 
However, lasting democracy has not been established, and American  taxpayers
should not be dunned for the cost of maintaining the illusion  of democracy in
the least democratic country in the Americas  (after communist Cuba).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Continue pressure against Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.</B>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to return to Cuba all  refugees
intercepted at sea, but Castro has made no economic or  political concessions.
Castro wants the U.S. trade embargo lifted, but  he refuses to relax his
totalitarian enslavement of the Cuban  people. Until Castro agrees to make real
free-market and democratic  concessions aimed at freeing the Cuban people, the
U.S. should  continue to turn the economic screws against Castro, as it did 
recently by approving the Helms-Burton Bill that tightens sanctions  against
Cuba.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican peso crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso  collapsed
because the Mexican economy is not free and  because Mexico is not a
full-fledged democracy. NAFTA prevented  the Mexican crisis from becoming much
worse, because it  provided Mexico with a strong institutional anchor that
encouraged the  government to stay on course with the economic and political 
reforms that, over the next decade, will foster the consolidation of a  true
capitalist democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is NAFTA responsible for growing illegal immigration  and drug
trafficking from Mexico?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Mexicans emigrate to the U.S., legally and illegally,  because
they are fleeing poverty and repression. Mexicans have been  migrating to
America for over 100 years and will continue to do so  as long as they are
denied opportunities for economic advancement  in their own country. NAFTA
compels the Mexican government  to open up the Mexican economy; over the next
10-15 years,  therefore, more economic freedom in Mexico will be reflected in 
reduced immigration to the U.S. Similarly, NAFTA is not  responsible for drug
trafficking in North America. The real cause is  the lack of economic and
political freedom in Mexico, combined  with incoherent U.S. anti-drug policies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Wouldn't America be better off without NAFTA?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Without NAFTA, relations between the U.S. and Mexico  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 70 -->  deteriorate. NAFTA is the first
successful effort, in nearly  200 years of frequently difficult U.S.-Mexico
relations, to build a  lasting partnership based on economic prosperity and
democratic  stability. Abolishing NAFTA would not end common security  concerns
related to economic relations, immigration, and drug  trafficking. However, with
NAFTA in place, the U.S. has an  effective foreign policy instrument with which
to create a durable  cross-border relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Was the military occupation of Haiti a mistake?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Yes. President Clinton's commitment of U.S. troops to  Haiti was
driven by domestic policy concerns. Haiti has no  democratic tradition, and
history teaches that democracy cannot be  imposed forcibly by external power.
The creation of a true democracy  in Haiti is important to all democracies in
the Americas, but the  drive to become a democracy must come from within.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Throughout most of its history, America sought to avoid  entanglement in the
affairs of other countries, focusing instead on  peaceful avenues of trade.
America has grown into an industrial giant  partly because of international
trade, which now accounts for some  23 percent of the national wealth. With
increased reliance on  global markets, the U.S. is trying to expand its exports
by involving  itself in agreements such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While America has been largely a free-trade nation, the  principles of free
trade today are under siege. On the one side of the  argument are those who
advocate free trade because it creates  jobs, promotes economic growth, and
maximizes efficiency and  individual wealth. On the other are those who argue
that free  trade forces American manufacturing overseas, and leads to lost 
jobs, declining wealth, and increased national suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To its proponents, free trade is a matter of principle.  Individuals should
enjoy the right to buy lawful products, wherever  made, without governmental
interference. Free traders believe that  governments should not dictate to
individuals what clothes they  will wear, what food they will eat, and which
cars they will drive  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  benefit domestic producers.
Tariffs, import quotas,  discriminatory regulations, and other forms of
protectionism are unwarranted  infringements of individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents also believe that free trade promotes economic  growth and
creates jobs for Americans. Virtually all economists argue  that free trade
increases competition, spurs innovation, lowers  prices, accelerates economic
growth, and on balance creates more  jobs than are lost to foreign competition.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of free trade advocate closed borders and argue  that cutting off
or restricting trade with other nations is in  America's interest. While they
admit that tariffs and import quotas raise  consumer prices, they believe such
measures also safeguard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps no other recent public figure has advocated trade  protectionism
more vigorously than Patrick Buchanan, who says  he would impose stiff tariffs
on imports and withdraw America  from almost all of its international
agreements, including the  North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada
and  the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trade organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The outcome of this debate is vitally important to America's  future. The
choice before the U.S. is whether to continue or  abandon its standard of living
and its position as the world's  leading economy. A false move on the trade
front could have  disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy. It should be
recalled that  the protectionism of the 1930s was a major factor in bringing 
about the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The challenge for America is whether it will embrace free trade  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  a key to its continuing
prosperity. Linked to this challenge are  such issues as expanding NAFTA to
include Chile and other  countries, expanding free trade in Asia through the
Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, expanding trade across the 
Atlantic with Europe, and dealing with the entry of the People's  Republic of
China (PRC) and Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) into  the World Trade
Organization. Generally, free traders have been  disappointed in President
Clinton's handling of all these trade  issues. They accuse him of dragging his
feet on expanding NAFTA  to include Chile and of trying to force &quot;managed&quot;
trade deals  with the Japanese over auto parts.

 of the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services is  a mere
1.5 percent of America's overall economy (gross  national product). America's
annual budget deficit  2.5 percent of GNP   is almost twice the size of its
trade deficit.

not  including the newly independent states of the former Soviet  Union. These
exports support over 2 million U.S. jobs. Removing  barriers to U.S. exports to
Europe means creating more American jobs in  a number of different sectors,
including agricultural goods,  automobiles, electric power and natural gas
equipment, information  technology products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,
and  telecommunications equipment.

<P>Since the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the expansion of  free trade has
been the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward  Latin America and the Caribbean. The
Enterprise for the Americas  Initiative launched by former President George Bush
in 1989 laid  out the goal of creating an American-led free-trade area 
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere, from Alaska in North America  to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. The first step in creating  a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) was taken by the  Bush Administration in 1990 with the
announcement that the U.S.  would negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the  U.S.
Congress in 1993 and implemented as of January 1, 1994.  Subsequently, at the
Summit of the Americas held in Miami,  Florida, from December 9-11, 1994,
President Clinton and all of the  democratically elected leaders of Latin
America, the Caribbean,  and Canada pledged unanimously to create an FTAA by the
year  2005; President Clinton also pledged that Chile would become  NAFTA's
fourth member by 1996, thus confirming to the region's  leaders that the U.S.
was firmly committed to hemispheric trade  expansion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In April 1994, the United States signed the Uruguay Round  trade agreement,
which went into force on January 1, 1995. The  Reagan Administration initiated
these trade negotiations in 1986 as part  of an ongoing series of talks under
the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was the seventh &quot;round&quot;
of GATT  trade talks that started in 1947. Prior to World War II, many 
countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  established barriers to
international trade which contributed to  the Great Depression in the U.S. and
Europe. Following the war,  many of these barriers remained in place. The first
GATT round  was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947 and resulted in some 
45,000 separate agreements that reduced tariffs on manufactured  goods and some
agricultural goods. Since GATT's inception, world  trade has expanded from less
than $100 billion in the late 1940s to  over $3 trillion today. Among other
things, the Uruguay Round  agreement creates a new body called the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This organization is a forum in which countries can  seek
peaceful solutions to trade disputes without resorting to trade  protectionism.
Thus, instead of occasional international trade  negotiations like the seven
rounds GATT talks, the WTO allows for  ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  is America's
institutional link to fast-growing Asian  economies. Formed in 1989, APEC
encompasses Australia, Brunei,  Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. The  leaders of
APEC's member economies, including President Bill  Clinton, in 1994 set as their
goal achieving &quot;free trade and investment  in the Asia Pacific&quot; region
by 2010 for developed members and  by 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, while paying lip service to free trade, the Clinton  Administration
has pursued a policy that isolates America from  the international economy and
thus threatens Americans whose  jobs depend on international trade. For example,
NAFTA's  expansion to include Chile has stalled because the Administration and 
Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  gress cannot agree on the language
of a new fast-track  negotiating authority. The Administration insists on
language that would  allow trade sanctions to be imposed against countries that
violate  labor and environmental rules contained in the side agreements  to
NAFTA. Republican leaders in Congress reject this demand,  arguing that
extraneous issues unrelated to trade should not be  confused with trade. Without
a new fast-track negotiating  authority, NAFTA cannot be expanded to Chile, and
it is unlikely that  free-trade agreements could be negotiated with any other
country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton snubbed other government heads and  reduced American
prestige in the region when he skipped the  November 19, 1995, Leaders' Meeting
in Osaka, Japan. The leaders will  meet in November 1996 in Subic Bay,
Philippines, and again in  November 1997 in Canada to review the each member's
progress  toward achieving APEC's free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has vacillated between free trade and  managed trade in
Asia. On one hand, he agreed to create a vast APEC  free-trade area, including
China and Japan, and help China join  the World Trade Organization (WTO). On the
other, he has  tightened import quotas on Chinese apparel and textiles and has
tried  unsuccessfully to force Japan to consent to new managed trade  agreements
on autos and semiconductors. Additionally, since  Clinton became President, the
U.S. has threatened to impose trade  sanctions on such imported products as
steel, textiles, cellular  telephones, consumer electronics products, and a host
of other  manufactured goods.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The path of trade protectionism paved by the Clinton  Administration should
be reversed. America needs to be put back on the  road to free trade. In 1997,
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Establish free-trade areas between the United States
and its  trading partners.</B> NAFTA should be expanded to incorporate Chile 
and other Latin American countries, and Caribbean nations should  receive
trading parity with NAFTA members. The U.S. should  cooperate with other APEC
members and take more concrete steps  at the next two Leaders' Meetings to
achieve a free-trade area in  the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. also should encourage
other Latin  American economies to join Chile and Mexico in APEC in 1997. 
Finally, the U.S. should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested
European countries, including the recently freed nations in  Eastern and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Propose a free-trade area &quot;framework agreement&quot; with 
European countries interested in a free-trade area with the U.S.</B> A 
framework agreement precedes a free-trade agreement, allowing both sides  to
propose which items and topics they wish to pursue as part of  the formal
negotiating process. It is a necessary first step toward  formal negotiations to
create a free-trade agreement with  European countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free trade area with Europe would make it easier for U.S.  companies to
sell their goods there.<B> </B>Most European countries still  have their own
peculiarities regarding product standards, testing,  labeling, and
certification. These differences often increase the cost  of U.S. products as
companies must alter their products to meet  these differing requirements. A
free-trade area with Europe would  allow the U.S. and Europe to seek common
product standards,  testing, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  labeling, and certification
requirements, thereby reducing the  costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free-trade area with Europe also would increase America's  access to
Europe's agricultural market. Even though the U.S.  and Europe reached an
agreement in 1994 to reduce some  agricultural subsidies as part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), Europe still maintains a host of
subsidies, trade  quotas, and import bans that restrict or prevent U.S.
agricultural exports  to Europe. Likewise, the U.S. still maintains agricultural
 subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions that restrict agricultural 
imports from Europe. A free-trade agreement would allow U.S.  and European
negotiators to reduce barriers and promote  agricultural exports on both sides,
benefiting all parites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-    Support the accession of both the People's Republic of China  and
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade  Organization on a
commercially viable basis.</B> In 1986, Beijing applied to  resume China's seat
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the predecessor of the WTO,
which the Republic of China on  Taiwan had abandoned in 1950. In 1990, Taiwan
also applied to join  the GATT. Following Hong Kong's example, Taiwan elected to
 apply as the autonomous customs territory of &quot;Chinese Taipei,&quot; 
rather than as a sovereign country. This move was intended to  finesse Beijing's
sensitivities over questions of sovereignty. Beijing  insists that Taiwan not
join the WTO before the PRC, but has offered  as its first act as a WTO member
to sponsor Taiwan. Joining  the WTO is an economic, not political, act.
Therefore, Beijing  should not be allowed to block Taiwan's entry; each
application should  be considered on its own merits. Although negotiations with 
Taiwan have progressed further, neither China nor Taiwan has offered  suf
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ficient concessions to warrant
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Demand an end to China's practice of forcing foreign firms  to
transfer technology as a condition of investing.</B> The leverage  that China
can exert with its huge market makes it difficult even  for large industrial
firms to resist this form of  government-sponsored theft. The U.S. must also
insist that all existing bilateral  trade agreements, especially the 1995
Intellectual Property  Rights Memorandum of Understanding, be fully enforced
before  approving China's accession to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal the outdated Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade  Act of
1975.</B> The Jackson-Vanik Trade Act was designed to  encourage the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift  restrictions on Jewish
emigration to Israel and the U.S. It  withdraws America's most-favored-nation
trading status from any  country that restricts immigration. Threatening to deny
MFN status  to China because of human rights abuses has become an annual  ritual
in Congress. But maintaining MFN with China is clearly  in America's economic
interest. At stake are billions of dollars  in trade. It also encourages the
liberalization of China's political  system. Trade forces China to open up to
the outside world and  therefore serves the long-run cause of human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Approve fast track for Chile before the 1996 elections.</B> Chile 
has enjoyed the fastest economic growth and the greatest  economic stability of
any country in Latin America since the mid-1980s. It  is in the forefront of
economic and democratic reform in the  Americas, having successfully achieved
the transition from military  dictatorship to civilian democracy. Chile is a
member of the APEC;  it is a strong candidate to join Mercosur (the South
American  Com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mon Market comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)  when Mercosur's members can reduce their
tariffs to match Chile's;  and it has a working bilateral trade agreement with
Mexico.  However, Chile cannot join NAFTA before 1997 if Congress does not 
approve fast-track negotiating authority. Under fast track,  trade agreements
negotiated by the Administration are submitted  to Congress for a straight
up-or-down vote; however, Congress  may not change or amend any portion of the
proposed agreement  before voting. Chile is the benchmark against which the rest
of the  region will measure America's hemispheric vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Submit more accurate trade reports.</B> The United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) produces an annual report on foreign  trade barriers. This
report is important because it identifies the  barriers that U.S. exporters face
when selling their products  overseas. However, it tells only one side of the
story. America maintains  a host of import restrictions such as trade quotas,
high tariffs,  and import bans that are not described in the report. They should
 be. By including such information, the U.S. government would  be presenting a
more open picture of the status of free trade and  of where reforms are still
needed, including within the U.S.  Moreover, such USTR reports should
incorporate a scorecard of  the current cost to the economy of each of these
U.S. restrictions  on trade.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support free trade when our huge trade deficit  is
destroying jobs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America's trade deficit is only 1.5 percent of the size of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  overall U.S. economy. The U.S.
budget deficit is 2.5 percent  of America's GNP. Thus, while much is made of
America's  trade deficit, it is nearly half the size of the U.S. budget deficit.
The  budget deficit hinders America's economy far more than does  the trade
deficit. Free trade creates jobs: One of every five U.S. jobs  is the result of
U.S. trade. Besides, free trade provides  Americans with greater consumer
choice, adds to the national wealth, and  is responsible for the fact that
American businesses are the  largest exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Free trade is fine, but shouldn't America require a level  playing
field with its trading partners?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Countries that maintain trade barriers harm their  own
economies for more than they harm America's. Rather  than threaten to close
America's markets to foreign countries if they  do not remove barriers to U.S.
exports, America should seek to  use free-trade areas and the newly created
international dispute  settlement forum, the World Trade Organization, to
encourage  open markets. Under the WTO, the U.S. would be able to seek the 
opening of foreign markets through negotiations rather than threats  and
destructive retaliation. Even if the U.S. could not achieve  open markets abroad
through such means, it would be better  for America and its consumers to
dismantle U.S. trade  protectionism unilaterally than to impose higher barriers
to foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Shouldn't America tell countries like Japan that if they do  not open
up, we will close our borders to them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. That would be self-defeating. Japan is America's  largest
overseas market. It imports more goods and services from the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  than the United Kingdom and
Germany combined and  is America's largest overseas market for agricultural
goods. Also,  the average Japanese person buys more goods and services from  the
U.S. than the average U.S. citizen buys from Japan. Why  does America have a
trade deficit with Japan?  There are many  factors, including the stubbornness
of American companies in refusing  to design products for the Japanese market.
But the main reason  is that there are twice as many Americans as there are 
Japanese. Even the Clinton Administration agrees that if Japan removed  all
supposed trade barriers to U.S. imports, the deficit would  shrink only
marginally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican crisis. The peso  collapsed on
December 19, 1994, because the Mexican economy is not  sufficiently free, and
because Mexico's political system is  undemocratic. Moreover, former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari refused to make needed monetary and
exchange  policy adjustments in advance of Mexico's 1994 presidential 
elections. When investors lost confidence in Mexico, they fled to safer 
markets. Mexico was unable to retain the confidence of investors  because it
lacked strong economic and democratic  institutions. Thanks to NAFTA, however,
President Ernesto Zedillo is  implementing economic and political reforms that
should create the  institutions Mexico lacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is fast track, and why is it important?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Fast-track negotiating authority consists of special  legislative
rules adopted by Congress. These authorize the President to  nego
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  tiate trade agreements and submit
them to Congress for an  up-or-down vote without the addition of any amendments
by  Congress. Fast track accelerates the process of negotiating free trade 
agreements with other countries, while providing them the  assurance that
agreements they reach with the U.S. government will not  be changed subsequently
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is it important that fast track be approved before the  1996
elections?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> On four separate occasions since 1990, the U.S. has  pledged
officially that Chile would become the fourth member of  NAFTA. If Chile is not
admitted to NAFTA until 1997, America will  lose the opportunity to take the
lead in negotiating free-trade  agreements with other major economies in South
America,  including Argentina and Brazil. By 1997, Chile's interest in joining 
NAFTA may weaken, and America's chances of consolidating U.S.  leadership in
South America may be diminished. Chile cannot  join NAFTA until Congress has
granted fast-track negotiating  authority to the President. This authority is
needed to expedite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Since NAFTA has not worked, why would a free-trade  area with Europe
work.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA has worked. Exports to Mexico increased by 20  percent
during the NAFTA's first year in 1994. Due to the  Mexican peso crisis, U.S.
exports to Mexico dropped slightly during  1995, but they were still higher than
the total for 1993, before  NAFTA was implemented. Moreover, the &quot;giant
sucking sound&quot;  predicted by Ross Perot never did occur. In fact, some
companies  that moved to Mexico prior to the NAFTA now are moving back to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  U.S. Why?  Because even though
Mexican workers may get  paid less, some companies are finding it harder to get
their products  out of Mexico because its roads, ports, and transportation
networks  are costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens if some members of the European Union want  a free-trade
area with the U.S. but others do not?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should extend an offer for a free-trade area directly 
to the European Union. At the same time, it should extend an offer  to
non-European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe,  and even to the newly
independent states of the former Soviet  Union. If the EU drags its feet in
negotiating with the U.S.,  America should pursue a free-trade area with such
non-EU members as  the Czech Republic and Estonia, two of Europe's most rapidly 
growing market economies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What U.S. industries could be expected to benefit from  freer trade
with Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A host of industries would benefit from freer trade with  Europe.
These would include those involved in agriculture,  telecommunications, and the
manufacturing of automobiles, medical  equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

</center><p>

<P>Beyond the traditional tools of statecraft  war and diplomacy   America has
many lesser tools at its disposal in formulating  and executing foreign policy.
Like all good tools, however, they  are means to an end and should be used only
under the right  circumstances and with proper care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of these tools is the United Nations. The U.S. should treat  the U.N.
not as some superior body to which it must apply for  approval, but as an
institution which can be useful in cultivating  international support for U.S.
policy. Another tool is foreign aid.  Aid can be an effective adjunct to U.S.
foreign policy, but only if  it works and serves American interests, neither of
which it has  done very well. Two other tools, both of which are indispensable 
for national security, are intelligence gathering and covert  operations. Even
though the Cold War is over, the chaotic and  threatening condition of today's
world requires a robust and effective  intelligence capability. Finally, there
is the important work of  public diplomacy, as represented by the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the Voice of America (VOA), and other  official
media. Telling the American story to people overseas helps  build international
support for democracy and freedom, as well as  for specific U.S. policies.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America must be engaged in world affairs. The U.S. cannot  protect its vital
interests unless it seeks to influence world opinion  and events in such
international bodies as the United Nations. But  this does not mean compromising
American principles, sovereignty,  or freedom of action. Whether in the U.N. or
any other  multilateral organization, the U.S. government should strive to
protect  American interests and represent American values. America must  pursue
its own agenda, not that of international bureaucrats often  hostile to U.S
interests. Only by doing so can the United States  remain strong enough to
contribute effectively to international peace  and stability.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How to develop this American agenda in international  diplomacy is an issue
which separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals tend to distrust American
power and seek to constrain it by tying  it to the U.N. Conservatives, knowing
that this power historically  has been used for good, want to liberate it from
these constraints.  Liberals want to put American forces under U.N. military 
command, and to have America adopt the U.N. bureaucracy's generally  socialist
agenda as its own; some have gone so far as to propose  that the U.N. be given
taxing powers over U.S. citizens. By  contrast, conservatives want America to
retain sovereign control over  its own military forces when they are involved in
U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Above all, conservatives want to prevent the U.S.
 from becoming a mere servant of the U.N.'s agenda, as the Clinton 
Administration has allowed to happen in Somalia and elsewhere;  they are willing
to work through the U.N. when it suits American  interests, but not when these
interests are not served.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether, and to what extent, to support  U.S. policy abroad
through public diplomacy. Most people believe  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  the U.S. needs some form of public
diplomacy to explain  American policy and values to people in foreign lands. It
is well  known that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of  America
played important roles in bringing down the Iron Curtain.  What role should they
play in today's international diplomacy?   And once this role has been
established, what is the best way to  convey this message, through existing
official media structures and  outlets or through new ones?

<P>

<P>Even its strongest advocates recognize that the U.N. is  bloated, wasteful,
poorly managed, and disorganized. Only  fundamental reform can reinvigorate the
U.N. and restore its lost  credibility. The Clinton Administration itself
recognizes that unless the  U.N. is reformed, it will drift into irrelevance and
lose public support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.N. claims that the U.S. is some $1.3 billion behind in  its financial
contributions. Washington says the figure should  be somewhat less. With
approximately half of its 185 member  states delinquent in their dues, the U.N.
is in serious financial crisis.  The Clinton Administration wants to pay, but
Congress wants to  withhold payment until the U.N. gets its budget under control
and  ends corruption and poor management practices. The Clinton  Administration
may propose a deal with Congress to repay America's  back fees over several
years in return for promised U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past few years, the U.N. has proven that it cannot  manage 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  large, complex, and ambitious &quot;peace
operations&quot;  competently. This was seen most clearly in the debacles in
Somalia and  the former Yugoslavia. Not only have these operations been 
spectacular failures; they have been costly in terms of lives, material 
resources, and money. The U.S. spent almost $3 billion (in  direct and indirect
costs) in 1995 to support these failed U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious issue involves the specialized agencies.  Conservatives
believe that agencies such as the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and
United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO) do not merit
American financial  support or membership. Not only are they poorly managed and 
wasteful, but their mandates are counterproductive.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     There is broad consensus that the U.N. needs
reforming.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 1995 address
to  the U.N. General Assembly, proposed a &quot;concrete agenda&quot; for  U.N.
reform. This agenda involves ending programs that have  achieved their purpose,
consolidating overlapping programs,  downsizing regional economic commissions,
and imposing a moratorium  on big conferences.<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Funding for the U.N. system falls into two categories:
assessed  and voluntary contributions. An assessed contribution is the price  of
membership in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.  Countries make voluntary
contributions to specialized agencies they  also wish to support. For 1996, the
Clinton Administration  requested some $1.07 billion for U.S. assessed and
voluntary contributions  to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and
commissions.  Actual 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. spending for these
organizations totaled $1 billion in  1994. By contrast, more than 90 other
countries together account for  less than 1 percent of the U.N. budget, paying
only .01 percent each.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Cases of fraud and abuse erupt with disturbing regularity. In 
1995, for example, $10 million was embezzled from the United  Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Kenya. Various agencies of  the U.N. spent approximately $1
million a day at the height of the  Somalia peacekeeping operation in 1993. This
included renting  hundreds of apartments equipped with air conditioning. In 
December 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile  security
system at its New York headquarters. The reason: The  turnstile clocks would
have tracked the arrival and departure times of  U.N. employees. In 1995, the
U.N. spent some $500,000 for a  two-week conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island  Developing States, including $15,000 to fly
representatives from  the Western Sahara to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has grown into a massive bureaucracy of over 70 
agencies and programs, including the United Nations Research  Institute for
Social Development (UNRISD) and the International  Labor Organization (ILO),
with overlapping mandates. The U.N.  system has over 50,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States plays a key role in supporting U.N. 
peacekeeping. Until last year, the U.S. paid nearly one-third of the  annual
$3.5 billion peacekeeping bill (now unilaterally reduced to 25  percent). The
U.S. assigns thousands of American soldiers to  U.N. missions and provides
billions of dollars worth of  transportation, equipment, and other support
services to the U.N. at no charge.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Until recently, traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations 
entailed small observation or peacekeeping missions deployed to  monitor an
already existing peace settlement. These operations  were simple, inexpensive,
unambitious, and usually staffed by  countries like Canada, Sweden, Norway, or
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     With the end of Cold War tensions among members of the 
Security Council, there was an explosion in peacekeeping  operations from 1989
to 1993, with the Security Council authorizing  more missions than it had in the
previous 40 years. In 1990, the  U.N. controlled approximately 10,000 &quot;blue
helmets&quot; in eight  operations at a cost of less than $700 million per year.
By the end  of 1993, there were over 90,000 &quot;blue helmets&quot; in 18
different  operations costing over $3.5 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has conducted 21 observation missions and six 
traditional peacekeeping missions since 1948. These missions have  a mixed
record in limiting armed conflict and promoting  conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has expanded the definition of peacekeeping 
significantly since 1990. Now peacekeeping is called &quot;second  generation
peacekeeping&quot; or &quot;peace-enforcement.&quot;  In these  operations,
peacekeepers have been sent to volatile and dangerous areas  (such as Somalia
and Bosnia) before a conclusive peace was  achieved. These missions have been
large (employing up to 40,000  troops); complex (involving armored combat
formations with combat  air and naval support); dangerous (resulting in hundreds
of  U.N. troops killed in Somalia and Bosnia); ambitious (attempting  to impose
peace through force of arms); and expensive (costing  the U.N. almost $5 million
per day in Bosnia). All have been failures. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     As of August 1995, the U.S. had over 3,200 American troops 
deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. These  operations include
Macedonia, Western Sahara, Kuwait, and Haiti.  The U.S. also provided the great
bulk of NATO air forces to enforce  a U.N.-sponsored &quot;no-fly zone&quot;
over Bosnia-Herzegovina  from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Peacekeeping operations harm U.S. combat readiness. Time 
spent on peacekeeping missions is time not spent learning or  rehearsing
critical warfighting skills. A recent General Accounting  Office report noted
the deleterious effects of peacekeeping on  readiness,<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm">2</A> documenting how it can take 12 to 18
months for a unit to return  to the minimum proficiency standards required by
U.S. doctrine.  This means, for instance, that the U.S. Army in Europe, which
has  deployed most of its units to Bosnia for peace implementation  duty, will
be out of the warfighting business for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. cannot command and control most military operations. 
It does not have the legitimacy, authority, structure, or procedures  to
organize and direct military missions competently. U.N.  command and control is
characterized by confusion and unresponsiveness.  A prime example is the
incoherent command and control  structure used in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. withdrew from the Paris-based United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in  1984 because of
its hostility to free markets and record of waste  and abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In January 1996, the U.S. Army court-martialed Specialist 
Michael 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  New. Specialist New had refused to
wear a U.N. beret and  insignia when his unit was deployed on U.N. duty in
Macedonia,  maintaining that he swore an oath of allegiance to the U.S.
Constitution  and not to the U.N. However, under U.S. law, up to 1,000 U.S. 
soldiers can be deployed at any one time in U.N. missions. Specialist  New swore
an oath to follow all legal orders and was treated fairly,  but his case raises
the broader issue of U.S. participation in U.N.  military missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Secretary General Boutros-Ghali in January 1996 mentioned  the
possibility that the U.N. might impose a tax on such activities  as
international air travel and currency exchanges to gain &quot;a  minimum of
independence&quot; from member nations. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration began with a great deal of  enthusiasm for the
United Nations. President Clinton and his team  believed that with the end of
the Cold War, the U.N. could be  reinvigorated and begin to live up to the lofty
language of its Charter,  which assumes a central role for the organization in
preserving peace  and international security. The Clinton plan was for America
to  provide considerable support for U.N. peacekeeping and other  activities,
including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration initially embraced an  interventionist U.N. Under
the doctrine of &quot;assertive multilateralism,&quot; the  U.S. would advance
its security goals by working &quot;assertively&quot; with  the U.N. rather than
unilaterally or with allies. Central to this  approach was heavy American
support of U.N. peacekeeping. U.N.  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went
so far as to advocate  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  standing U.N. army under his
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton was forced to retreat from this doctrine after  the
failure of the U.N. operation in Somalia, where the U.N.  undertook an ambitious
nation-building mandate for which it was  unprepared. In support of this
mission, President Clinton deployed U.S.  Army Rangers who were assigned to
capture a Somali warlord for  the U.N. In October 1993, American soldiers were
drawn into a  street battle in Mogadishu during which 18 Americans were killed 
and 75 wounded. In May 1994, Clinton backtracked and issued  Presidential
Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25), placing restrictions  on U.S. participation in
U.N. peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The highlight of the Clinton Administration's U.N. reform  effort has been
to establish an Inspector General's office in New  York. For years, Congress has
been pushing this idea. Unfortunately,  this office has only limited scope and
has been characterized as a  &quot;disappointment&quot; by Representative Lee
Hamilton (D-IN) and  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of Congress who
 have long championed the U.N. Driven by budget constraints,  the Clinton
Administration in December 1995 announced the  long-overdue U.S. withdrawal from
the United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress tried to restrict some of the more  egregious Clinton
policies toward the U.N. The House and Senate  passed separate bills in 1995
that would cut U.S. financial contributions  to U.N. peacekeeping and limit U.S.
forces deployed in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Both bills embody provisions
of the  Contract With America. During negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration, language in the defense authorization bill that placed  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  on U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping was dropped.  President Clinton claimed that these limits were a
challenge to his  authority as commander in chief and threatened to veto the
bill if it  contained any such language. Congress backed down and passed  a
defense bill without these restrictions in January 1996. The  President
subsequently signed the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On another front, Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL) in  October 1995
introduced the United Nations Withdrawal Act. This  legislation would require
the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. by  the year 2000, retaining its membership
only in the U.N.'s  independent and specialized agencies. Representative
Scarborough's  bill was referred to the International Relations Committee, where
 it remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration boasts frequently of its participation  in
U.N.-sponsored international conferences. Vice President Al  Gore went to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development  in 1994 and accompanied Hillary
Clinton to the Copenhagen  Social Summit in 1995, and Mrs. Clinton and Health
and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the 1995 Fourth Women's 
Conference in Beijing. These conferences have come under  heavy criticism, both
for their anti-Western agendas and for their  wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In early 1996, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali floated the idea  of imposing
a U.N. tax on member nations. Republican  Senators Robert Dole (KS) and Jesse
Helms (NC) responded in January  by introducing legislation to bar U.S. payments
to the U.N. if it  tries to implement such a tax. The Clinton Administration
opposes  a U.N. tax.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To promote U.S. interests in the U.N. without sacrificing 
American sovereignty or effectiveness, and to ensure that America  does not get
dragged into unworkable peacekeeping operations, the  U.S. should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Limit its total non-peacekeeping contribution to no more  than
$500 million per year.</B> In 1995, America's assessed and  voluntary
contributions to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and  commissions totaled
some $1 billion. Approximately $260 million of  this amount went to the U.N.
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Stop paying assessed contributions to U.N. specialized  agencies.</B>
The few specialized agencies worthy of support, such as the  Universal Postal
Union and the World Meteorological  Organization, should be funded on a
case-by-case and voluntary basis from  the $500 million given to the U.N. This
dramatically reduced level  of spending will allow the U.S. to establish a
fundamentally  different relationship with a considerably scaled-back U.N.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never place U.S. troops under U.N. command.</B> The U.S.  may
choose to support some traditional peacekeeping operations,  such as the one in
Cyprus. However, U.S. forces should not be  placed under U.N. command. The U.S.
can provide support for U.N.  missions without operating in the U.N. chain of
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never give the Security Council veto power over American  foreign
policy.</B> It may be diplomatically useful to gain U.N.  Security Council
support for U.S. military actions, as President Bush did  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  the Persian Gulf War when his
Administration won a  Security Council resolution supporting the expulsion of
Iraq from  Kuwait. However, this support should never be considered essential. 
The U.S. should never allow Security Council politics to keep it  from defending
vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development  Program
(UNDP).</B> One of the bewildering array of specialized agencies  in the U.N.
system, UNDP is charged with &quot;contribut[ing] to a  sustainable expansion of
the world economy.&quot;  Essentially, it is a  foreign aid agency. Not only are
its programs unfocused and  duplicative, but foreign aid has proven
counterproductive in country  after country. Eliminating funding for this
specialized agency will  save the U.S. approximately $120 million a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End funding for all U.N. international conferences.</B> These 
conferences, which cost millions of dollars, are long on rhetoric  and short on
achievement. The 1995 Social Summit, for example,  focused on &quot;Creating
Jobs&quot; and &quot;Building Solidarity,&quot; two  objectives well beyond the
capabilities of a one-time gathering of  national and international bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Reject any proposal to vest the U.N. with taxing authority.</B> 
Senators Dole and Helms have introduced legislation that would  have the U.S.
stop paying its dues if the U.N. tries to impose a tax.  The Clinton
Administration also has voiced its opposition to the idea  of such a tax. The
U.S. should continue to send a strong message  that this trial balloon, floated
by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali  in January 1996 and bound to resurface
within the U.N., is  unacceptable.

bureaucracy in New York is not support for isolationism.  Conservatives support
NATO and other alliances, as well as limited  participation in the U.N. This is
not isolationist; it is international  engagement in support of American, not
U.N., interests.
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> When deciding American foreign policy, the President  should
consult with his advisors and the Congress, not the U.N. We  don't need the
permission of the U.N. to protect American freedom  and interests. The U.N. is
plagued with corruption, and many of  its activities, including its foreign aid
programs, perpetuate  dependency throughout the developing world. Moreover, the
U.N.  is merely a collection of often opposing national interests. It is 
ridiculous to suggest that the 180-plus governments in the U.N.   many of which
are dictatorships  represent the democratic will  of the world community.
</P>
<P>

<P><B>Q. The U.N. is responsible for international peace and  security. How
can the U.S. promote international peace and security if it  is not involved in
U.N. peacekeeping? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite its lofty objectives, the U.N. contributes only  margin
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  ally to international peace and
security. Since its creation in  1945, it has been a bit player on the world
stage. The U.S. remains  the world's principal force for international peace and
security  by maintaining forces in Europe and the Pacific region and by 
participating in alliance structures like NATO. It is highly misleading  to
measure a nation's contribution to the world's security by  gauging its
participation in marginal undertakings like U.N.  peacekeeping. America and its
Western allies ended the Cold War by being  militarily strong, not by
participating in &quot;peace&quot; missions  sponsored by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. An American soldier, Specialist Michael New, was  court-martialed in
January 1996 for refusing to wear U.N. insignia  and serve under U.N. command.
He maintains this violates his oath  to support and defend the Constitution of
the United States. Do  you support him?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As a soldier, Specialist New is obligated by his oath to obey 
the lawful orders of his chain of command. However unwise as a  matter of
policy, New's orders were not illegal. Therefore, he  should face the
consequences of his disobedience. However,  Specialist New should not have been
placed in a position where he  was forced to choose between his duty and his
conscience.  American soldiers should not be placed in the U.N. chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has floated the idea of  establishing
a U.N. tax on international commercial airline flights,  currency exchanges, and
other international transactions. What do  you think about this?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is ridiculous. The power to tax is a sovereign power of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  ernment, which is accountable to
the people in a free society.  The U.N. is accountable to no one but member
governments and  bureaucrats. The U.N. has no sovereignty over its member
states;  nor should it ever have such power. The U.N. is the creation and  the
servant of its member states. In any case, its problems stem  not from a lack of
money, but from having too much money. It is  very disturbing that Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali and others  within the U.N. are trying to make this power
grab.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In the first session of the 104th Congress, legislation was 
introduced to pull the U.S. out of the U.N. Why not go all the way  and simply
take the U.S. out of the U.N.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Security Council can serve some useful purposes. At  times,
for example, it can be a forum for discussion of important  international
issues. However, the U.S. should never feel constrained  by Security Council
resolutions, and U.S. participation in the U.  N. should be scaled back. A major
cut in U.S. funding would go  a long way toward achieving this goal.

<P>Effective intelligence is as necessary today as during the  Cold War.
Despite the end of the Cold War, the world remains a  very dangerous and
increasingly unpredictable place. Threats  to America's interests are real and
growing. They can arise in  regions vital to the U.S. with little or no warning.
America needs a  robust 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  intelligence gathering capacity
both to enable its leaders to  understand these threats and to give them as much
warning of  approaching danger as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. intelligence community today faces  serious problems and
challenges. The morale of the Central  Intelligence Agency has been severely
damaged by the Aldrich Ames spy  case. Moreover, the CIA has failed to predict
crucially important  developments, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The intelligence  community, like the
Defense Department, has been forced to  finance much of the so-called peace
dividend through drastic reductions  in budgets and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

National Reconnaissance  Office, which gathers and processes satellite imagery.
The CIA is  forbidden by law to conduct intelligence activities inside the U.S.;
 domestic intelligence and internal security are the responsibility  of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Overall coordination and  direction of foreign
intelligence is provided by the Director of  Central Intelligence (DCI),
although military intelligence operates  with a high degree of autonomy within
this structure.

<P><B>*</B>     The DCI is appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, which means the CIA is subject to a certain degree of  political
pressure from the White House. Ideally, however, the DCI is  objective and &quot;non-political,&quot;
since intelligence findings tailored  to fit political objectives can be
useless, if not actually dangerous  and misleading.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Most U.S. intelligence on foreign activities is derived from

<P>

<P><B>*</B>     Information gained from satellites is vital, especially in 
wartime. Satellites allow the U.S. to detect and track missile launches;  to
track the movements of foreign ground, air, and naval forces;  and to monitor
compliance with arms control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Although America's intelligence collection from satellites 
and signals intercepts is highly effective, the U.S. intelligence  community
relies heavily on high technology and neglects  intelligence from human sources
(HUMINT). There is no substitute for  the information provided by trained or
knowledgeable human  observers. People can enter underground or covered
facilities which  satellite sensors cannot observe. Only people can penetrate 
terrorist cells or drug networks, and only human agents can provide  some
assessment of an adversary's intentions.

</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has failed to resolve these  fundamental issues,
or even to undertake any serious reappraisal  of America's intelligence needs.
Nor has Clinton been able to  improve CIA morale in the wake of the Aldrich Ames
disaster.  Instead, the Administration has presided over a reduction of 
intelligence agency budgets and personnel without any clear rationale  or
understanding of the changing role of intelligence in the  post-Cold 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  War world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The intelligence community is being downsized at a rate of  3-5 percent per
year, with some vital components losing as much as  80 percent of their
personnel. Moreover, the Administration has  failed to recognize that the
national intelligence mission has not  diminished substantially with the end of
the Cold War; it has  become broader and more complex. While reducing its
resources, the  Administration continues to impose on the intelligence community
 a growing range of tasks, such as supporting arms control and  other
international agreements being pursued by the White House  and monitoring
developments in trouble spots like Somalia,  Rwanda, Haiti, and the Balkans
where the Administration has  committed U.S. forces to peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By demanding more of the intelligence community while  cutting its
resources, the Clinton Administration is in danger of  stretching America's
intelligence capabilities to the breaking point.  The President is jeopardizing
the intelligence community's ability  to provide strategic warning in the event
of conflict and to  furnish vital analysis to the national command authority in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that the Administration has politicized the  CIA by &quot;cooking&quot;
intelligence findings to support preconceived  positions. Perhaps the most
glaring example has been  the Administration's attempt to downplay the ballistic
missile threat  to the continental United States in order to justify its
opposition  to national missile defense<B>.

the  Administration to conduct a thorough assessment of the types of

then to  base budget and manpower decisions on that assessment. So far,  this
has not been done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Shore up the human side of espionage. </B> Because
America's  high technology is superior, the intelligence community has 
developed a strong technocratic bias. It often neglects the human side of 
intelligence gathering. Technical intelligence is valuable, but it has  its
limits. Only people can get inside an underground weapons  storage facility or,
more important, get inside the thinking of a  potential aggressor or penetrate a
terrorist cell. Improving human  intelligence will require institutional change
that assures career  advancement for officers who are aggressive in recruiting
and  &quot;running&quot; informants and operatives and that allows agency
officers to  use commonsense criteria in recruiting foreign operatives and 
informants. Common sense suggests that foreign informants  sometimes will be
unsavory characters. As long as these informants do  not harm Americans, the
U.S. should not assume responsibility for  all their actions merely because they
are informants or working  on contract.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Generate more innovation and creativity in the

imagination and creativity in concluding what the data  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  saying, in discerning the
patterns and trends suggested by the  data. The CIA needs to reward agents in
the field for innovative  collection methods. It also needs to reward analysts
for foresight,  insight, and good judgment in drawing proper conclusions from
the  information collected. The DCI must not merely manage the  Agency but lead
it. That means ending the mindset of risk-averse,  bureaucratic caution that
dominates the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen the CIA's counter-intelligence  capabilities</B>. There must
be no more Ames-like penetrations of the CIA. This will  require an internal or
institutional change in thinking which  accepts the possibility that U.S.
intelligence agencies are targets for  foreign penetration and that,
regrettably, some Americans like  Ames can be recruited to betray their country.
Better congressional  oversight which demands accountability by CIA managers,
and  support by the DCI and the Agency for a vigorous  counter-intelligence
effort inside the Agency, are also necessary for improving 
counter-intelligence.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Better control the dissemination of intelligence not

<P><B>A.</B> America and its allies still face a variety of threats and  new
challenges to vital interests even though the Cold War is over.  The radical
downsizing of U.S. military forces makes it more  crucial than ever that America

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. government needs to stay out of corporate  espionage.
Some argue that the U.S., while no longer engaged in a  military confrontation
with the Soviet Union, should see itself as  engaged in an economic war with
rest of the world. Such claims are  alarmist at least, and deceptive at best. If
American corporations want  to engage in the normal and legal gathering of
business  information, that is their choice. But diverting U.S. government 
intelligence agencies to spy for U.S. business risks discrediting  the
government's legitimate function. Recent allegations that the  CIA spied for the
United State Trade Representative's office  during automotive negotiations with
Japan are a case in point. Instead  of spying for American corporations, which
are private entities  not deserving of official support, intelligence agencies
should  be monitoring the sales of Russian nuclear weapons and the  movements of
Iranian submarines operating in the Persian Gulf.

America and other Third World countries, even  including some allegedly guilty

</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->

<P><B>A.</B> Informants are not the same as field officers, or what  are
loosely termed &quot;agents.&quot;  No one would hold a New York  policeman
responsible for the actions of a drug dealer turned  informant, especially if
the offending actions have nothing to do with the  undercover operation. The
same is true regarding CIA  informants. However, under no circumstances should
the CIA protect an  informant or contract employee who harms a fellow American. 
When such cases come to light, the Agency should terminate the  relationship at
once and report the criminal to the proper authorities,  even if it means losing
a valuable source of information.

<P>America's foreign aid program is coming under increasing  scrutiny, not only
by the American public, but also in Congress.  Although the $12 billion a year
spent on foreign aid represents a  relatively small part of the federal budget,
more and more  skeptics argue that this program is a waste of taxpayers' money.
There  is little evidence to support the contentions of proponents that  foreign
aid is vital to America's national interest. There is even  less evidence that
this money actually helps alleviate poverty in  less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why, then, has foreign aid proved to be one of the hardest  programs to cut
or eliminate?  The main reason is the way the  program is structured. The
foreign aid program has three major  elements. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First</B> is military and security assistance to promote
America's  national security abroad. Consisting of such undertakings as 
anti-narcotics efforts, joint military training exercises between U.S.  and
foreign forces, and grants to foreign countries to purchase  U.S. military
equipment, this program accounts for about 25 percent  of the overall foreign
aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second</B> is humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to aid 
victims of natural disaster and prevent mass starvation. This program  accounts
for some 15 percent of the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third</B> is economic and development assistance to promote  economic
growth in less developed countries. This program  consumes about 60 percent of
the foreign aid budget. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The debate over foreign aid often has centered on funding  levels for these
three major components. During the Cold War, the  U.S. funneled significant
amounts of military and security aid, as  well as economic and development
assistance, to its allies in the  fight against communism. Now that the Soviet
Union has  collapsed, however, critics of the program wonder why America needs 
to spend $12 billion a year around the globe. The Clinton  Administration argues
that the program is still needed to support  America's interests abroad.
Skeptics, many of whom questioned the merits  of the economic aid program even
during the Cold War, argue that  it makes even less sense today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many proposals have surfaced, from abolishing the Agency  for International
Development (AID), the agency in charge of  distributing America's foreign aid
dollars, to moving remaining  funding 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  and programs into existing
departments like State and  Defense. Another &quot;reform&quot; proposal would
increase the budget to face  the new challenges of the post-Cold War era and
re-focus the  program on what is called &quot;sustainable economic development&quot;
of  poorer countries. This is the argument made by the Clinton  Administration.

<P>There is bipartisan consensus that foreign aid needs to be  reformed. The
Clinton Administration's own study on  reinventing government argues that AID
does not have a single, clearly  defined and articulated strategic mission.
Shortly after this study  was issued, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced his  proposal for an enhanced Department of International Relations 
in which AID and other agencies would be abolished and their  functions assumed
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The State Department authorization bill would have moved  USIA, the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and  AID into the State Department. The
bill was derailed by  opposition from the Clinton Administration and Senate
Democrats, led  by Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The House of Representatives 
approved these consolidations in June 1995, and Senator Kerry  and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  (R-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  NC) agreed to a plan to cut the
operating expenses of these  agencies. Consolidation proponents believe that
these cuts will  force the Clinton Administration to move these three agencies
into  the State Department. A House-Senate conference report awaits  approval by
the Senate and the President, who has threatened to  veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1996 appropriations bill for foreign aid has been passed  by both houses
of Congress and signed by the President. This  measure cuts foreign aid spending
from $14.3 billion in FY 1995 to  $12.1 billion in FY 1996. The 1996
appropriations bill also includes  language requiring AID to submit to Congress
a detailed report  outlining the relative levels of economic freedom of foreign
aid  recipients. This report will make it more difficult for AID to  continue to
give money to countries with economically unfree or  repressed economies.

<P><B>*     Abolish the Agency for International Development, along  with most

AID is the main reason America continues  to waste so much money on foreign aid.
If Congress cannot pass  authorizing legislation that eliminates AID, it should
refuse to  appropriate any money for the agency's operating expenses until  such
legislation is signed into law. Moreover, international  development assistance
does not work. Countries receiving economic aid  for over 35 years are no better
off today than they were before.  Thus, not only should AID be abolished, but so
should the entire  development assistance program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Require the President to certify to Congress that any security 
and military aid sent abroad is necessary to support U.S. national  security
interests.</B> The foreign aid account is more than just  development
assistance; it also includes funds for military and  security assistance. It is
widely claimed that this money directly  supports the national interest abroad
by enhancing U.S. influence in  international affairs. However, many of
America's foreign aid  recipients routinely vote against the U.S. in the United
Nations; the  voting records of the U.N. show that three out of every four
recipients  of U.S. foreign aid vote against America more than half the time. 
<B> </B>If Congress is asked to appropriate foreign aid for the purpose  of
promoting the national interest, it should get more than a  promise from the
White House that it will get the job done.  Congress should require the
President to certify that U.S. foreign aid  supports American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Phase out funding for the World Bank, the International  Monetary 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  Fund, and the other multilateral
development banks.</B> These  multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been no
more  successful at promoting economic growth in less developed countries  than
has AID. In fact, a strong case can be made that they have had  less success
than AID. Since the 1950s, the World Bank and the  IMF have disbursed over $350
billion to less developed countries.  Most of these countries are no better off
today than they were  before receiving their money. In fact, many are worse off.
The  U.S. should phase out financial support to these institutions.

</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you call for cutting aid to the poor at a time  when more
people are living in poverty around the globe than ever  before?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because most economic aid perpetuates poverty. The only  way poor
countries can break out of the poverty trap is to stop  depending on foreign
aid. In this day and age, poverty is not the  natural condition of mankind; it
is a condition imposed by corrupt  governments which repress their economies.
Foreign aid does not  help countries develop. Most long-term recipients are no
better off  today then they were 30 years ago. If poor countries do not  adopt
economically free policies, they will remain poor, no matter  how much money we
throw at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You say foreign aid does not work. How come the  Marshall Plan, the
largest foreign aid program, is considered successful?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Marshall Plan was not development aid. It was a plan  to
rebuild already developed countries. But underdeveloped  countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  are not rebuilding an established
infrastructure; they are trying  to acquire one. They also do not have the
established  free-market economic foundations that post-war Europe had. Thus, 
while money spent in post-war Europe helped rebuild roads and  bridges, foreign
aid in the less developed world has done little good  because no amount of
foreign aid could provide the degree of  modernization and industrialization
which existed in Europe  before World War II.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Agency for International Development has been  extremely
successful in improving child mortality rates, providing  vaccinations, and
helping to feed those in immediate need of food.  How can you support cutting
funding for programs which help to  keep people alive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because Americans, as private citizens, are doing a better  job
than government in helping people. Americans spend some  $12 billion a year on
private overseas charities. AID spends less  than $100 million on disaster
relief and related programs. If  America has helped children and the poor in
less developed countries, it  is mainly because of the work of these private
charities.  Private charities are far more effective than AID, which is a 
bureaucracy that spends some 70 cents of every foreign aid dollar  within
America's borders. It is far better to give to private charities  than to waste
taxpayer dollars on American professors who, on  AID contracts, do nothing more
than write studies of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't foreign aid necessary at least for countries trying to  develop
free markets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No, but it can be useful if properly conceived, managed,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  targeted. Private foreign
investors spend some $18 billion a  year investing abroad. Those private
investments are much larger  than the $12 billion government dispenses each year
in foreign aid.  Foreign investment, not foreign aid, is necessary for  economic
growth. To attract foreign investment, governments must cut  taxes, privatize
business, eliminate regulations, and institute other  similar reforms. In most
cases, foreign governments do not need aid  to implement these reforms (the
obvious exceptions being  former Eastern Bloc nations, which can use it
constructively for  education and training to encourage the creation of market
institutions). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <B>Q.Won't cutting foreign aid result in more Somalias and Haitis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Both Haiti and Somalia are long-term recipients of  foreign
aid. Somalia has been hooked on U.S. foreign aid for 40  years, receiving over
$750 million since 1955. Yet Somalia is  poorer today than it was in 1965. Haiti
has received almost $1 billion  in foreign aid over 51 years, and it also is
poorer today than it was  in 1965. If economic aid is so necessary to create
economic  development in poor countries, why has it not worked in these two 
countries?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't the U.S. foreign aid program at least help  American
businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, it helps some businesses, contractors, and consultants.  But
this should not be the purpose of foreign aid. Choosing  winners and losers in
the market is not the proper business of  government. Rewarding special
interests with federal dollars will not help  poor countries abroad.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You may call it corporate welfare, but shouldn't Washington  be doing
all it can to help American businesses export?  After  all, exports mean jobs
for Americans. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. is the largest exporter in the world and would  remain
so without government subsidies, which help only a few  of America's businesses.
Many now-subsidized trade deals would  be made without this government
financing. Yes, some  businesses seem to &quot;win&quot; from government
subsidies, but the losers are  the American taxpayers who pay for these
programs. This  money should be left in the hands of the people who earned it
rather  than given to those who happen to have powerful friends in  Washington.

<P>Public diplomacy is the means by which the U.S.  government communicates
directly to the peoples of foreign countries.  Essentially, it involves the
information and cultural activities of  the United States government. Public
diplomacy enables the U.S.  government to present its perspective to people in
other countries  and to provide accurate information about the U.S. to those who
 otherwise would never receive it, preferably in a manner other  cultures will
find credible. These efforts take place outside of the  standard channels of
diplomacy  specifically, outside the State  Department, which conducts formal
diplomatic relations with other  nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this age of information, mass communication is rapid,  virtually 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  global, and accessible with
unprecedented ease to a larger  number of people than ever before. Information
can affect mass  sentiment and public opinion in foreign nations, and therefore
the policy  decisions of foreign governments. In certain situations, ideas  and
imagery can have greater impact than bombs and bullets.  Thus, public diplomacy,
particularly the direct dissemination of  policy decisions and the rationale for
making them, remains an  important tool of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A prime example of the impact of public diplomacy is the fall  of the Soviet
Union. The Soviets could not compete in the  modern world without opening up
their captive empire to new forms  of information and communication technology.
Once that  happened, they no longer could isolate their people from Western
ideals  of democracy, free markets, and individual liberty. It was the 
communication and popularization of these ideals which eroded  the legitimacy of
Communism and, as much as Western  military strength, eventually brought the
Soviet structure crashing down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some liberals criticize public diplomacy as a form of  propaganda. They see
it as a camouflage for activities that are improper for  the U.S. government.
This position flows from the Left's  reflexive &quot;blame America&quot;
attitude. Those who hold this view  evidently believe that America's
institutions are deeply flawed, and  that America's founding principles are
irrelevant to nations  struggling to find their way in the chaotic post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some conservatives are critical of public diplomacy as well.  They believe
that America should concentrate on solving internal  domestic problems like
out-of-control deficits and excessive  federal spending. These skeptics believe
that reaching foreign publics  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  American ideals should be
subordinated to other, more  pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While most Members of Congress support official U.S.  broadcasting, there is
no consensus in Congress or in the Administration  on how much the U.S. should
spend on public diplomacy. Nor is  there unanimity on how the official
components of public  diplomacy, such as the United States Information Agency,
should be  organized.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The primary broadcasting arms of the U.S.
government are 1)  the Voice of America, which broadcasts to nearly 100 million 
people worldwide; 2) Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL),  which is heard
in areas once under Soviet domination; and 3)  Radio Mart&iacute;, which covers
communist Cuba. VOA broadcasts  world news as well as statements of official
U.S. government  policy. RFE/RL reports on events and activities inside the
former  communist countries, thus serving as a surrogate news service for  local
citizens. This vital role is unique because of RFE/RL's  credibility as an
independent, non-local government source of news and  information.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. Information Agency conducts America's official 
information and cultural activities. For example, it maintains  libraries around
the world and hosts an extensive program of cultural  exchanges. It sponsors
foreign visitors who come to the U.S.  and have a chance to experience democracy
and free enterprise  firsthand. Its research bureau measures foreign public
reaction to  U.S. policies. Moreover, American spokesmen  not merely U.S.  gov

</P>
<P>Public diplomacy agencies and media have undergone  significant
reorganization since the Cold War ended. The Board for  International
Broadcasting was abolished at the end of 1995 by  presidential decision, and
funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty, formerly handled by the Board,
will be disseminated  directly through the United States Information Agency
(USIA), an  independent executive branch agency. This emphasizes USIA's role  as
America's primary arm of public diplomacy. However, even  while public diplomacy
is being consolidated under USIA, its budget  has been severely curtailed. The
USIA budget in FY 1993 was  $965 million. The budget for FY 1995 was $520
million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Neither Congress nor the Administration has provided  adequate support for
U.S. international broadcasting. For example,  the Voice of America (VOA), the
U.S. government's primary  broadcasting medium, has been severely slashed by
congressional  &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; resulting in the loss of 400 uniquely
skilled  professionals and the ability to broadcast in 20 foreign languages.
These  cuts in FY 1996 come on top of others mandated in the FY 1994 
International Broadcasting Act, which cut 900 staff employees at  Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty and 350 at the VOA.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Adjust methods of information
dissemination to the post-Cold  War era.</B> The USIA's audience is considerably
different in the  post-Cold War era; foreign audiences increasingly listen to 
AM/FM radio and watch television, while the number of short-wave  radio
listeners is falling sharply. Therefore, there must be a stronger  investment in
AM/FM radio and television broadcasting, but  short-wave investments may be
reduced to more appropriate levels.  At the same time, the U.S. government must
maintain a &quot;surge  capacity&quot; to reach foreign audiences directly. It
cannot rely on  commercial media outlets to articulate U.S. policy around the
world.  Information dissemination through the Internet also must be  encouraged.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Emphasize reaching the populations of emerging
democracies.</B>  The U.S. has a vested interest in reinforcing the emerging 
democracies' commitment to freedom and both economic and political  reform. The
benefits would be greater security for the U.S., increased  trade opportunities,
and stronger international economies. Public  diplomacy can facilitate this by
providing ideas, information, and  practical experience in the form of
broadcasting, professional  exchanges, and training programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Provide adequate funds for international
broadcasting.</B> Funding  for international broadcasting should be maintained
at current  levels. This requires at least $385 million for the VOA, $240
million  for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and $27 million for  Radio Mart&iacute;.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Now that the Cold War is over, isn't public diplomacy,  espe
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  cially government broadcasting,
unnecessary?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America still needs an effective voice to present democratic  and
free-market values in today's competitive global marketplace  of ideas. Other
nations, many of them unfriendly to America,  are speaking aggressively in this
marketplace. The revolutionary  regime in Iran is a notable example. America
needs to be there  as well, engaged in the vital war of ideas, in order to shape
the  kind of world we want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. America's values can reach the world through CNN,  other broadcast
media, and many forms of popular entertainment.  Why do we need the Voice of
America?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Much of the American popular entertainment that reaches  the
world  rock music and Hollywood films, for example     conveys a jaundiced view
of America, giving some countries one more  excuse to condemn the United States.
And CNN, while virtually  a global network, does not reach an audience nearly as
wide,  diverse, or strategically targeted as the audience for U.S.  government
broadcasting. Nor can CNN speak on behalf of the U.S.  government. We cannot
rely on Ted Turner to give our official  spokesmen the opportunity to tell
America's story, directly and  unfiltered, in a future world crisis. The United
States, as the  world's only remaining superpower, must retain this &quot;surge
capacity.&quot;   Pop culture and Hollywood shouldn't be the only broadcasters 
of American values abroad. America still needs an official voice  to explain its
policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the functions of USIA be merged into the State  department?</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some have argued that this would reduce bureaucratic  duplication
and save money, but any savings are offset by the fact  that USIA's basic role 
reaching foreign publics directly  often  conflicts with the State Department's
role in negotiating with  foreign government officials.

</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost opinion polls show that Americans are not very interested  in
foreign policy issues. Indeed, a CNN/<I>USA  Today</I>/Gallup poll early in
1996 found that only 14 percent of Americans regard  foreign policy as a top
priority in forming their vote. Nonetheless,  the American people still demand
that America have a strong  foreign policy that fulfills certain expectations.
These expectations  include maintaining America's leadership in the world,
upholding the  respect of other countries for America, and protecting  America's
interests and the country's future. Therefore, even though  Americans may
express little overt interest in specific foreign  issues, they have a latent
expectation that Presidents fulfill certain  expectations. Disappointing these
expectations can prove to be  politically fatal for a President.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American people are not isolationist; rather they are  largely
indifferent to foreign policy issues, focusing instead on more  immediate
domestic concerns. Isolationism implies America  must intentionally work alone
without allies, without concerning  itself with foreign matters at all.
Isolationism also implies trade  protectionism. Opinion polls show that
Americans are not  isolationist. They still want a strong America, although one
that relates  foreign policy problems to domestic concerns. Americans are 
worried about too much intervention abroad, but they understand the  need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  for the U.S. to remain engaged in
global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the end of the Gulf War, there has not been a  compelling issue to
ignite the latent interest of Americans in foreign policy.  If there were a
crisis with a clear impact on American security  and vital interests overseas,
foreign policy would return to the top  of political priorities in the polls.

all its potential enemies  combined. (Poll by <I>Americans on Defense Spending

<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet December 7,
1995
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This fact sheet provides information on the role and mission of  the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why The U.S. Must Play A Role In IFOR</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The United States has vital political, economic and security  interests in
Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens these interests.  We now have the first real
opportunity to end this war. To seize  this opportunity requires a commitment of
U.S. troops as part of  a NATO peace implementation force (IFOR). The risks to 
the United States of allowing the war to continue are greater than  the risks of
enforcing the peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What U.S. Forces Will Do At First</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will take approximately eight weeks for the entire U.S. force  of
approximately 20,000 soldiers to arrive in the northeastern  portion of Bosnia,
with a division headquarters in Tuzla. Most of  the troops will come from the
1st Armored Division in Germany.  They will travel to Bosnia mainly by road and
rail using routes that  are currently in use and clear of mines. A Nordic
brigade and a  reinforced Turkish battalion will also be located in the U.S. 
sector which will be under the control of the U.S. Army Major  General William
Nash, the commander of the 1st Armored Division.  Eventually a Russian brigade
will also be located in the U.S. sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When this main body of U.S. forces arrives, they will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force
</P>
<P>-      Execute transfer of the U.S. sector from the United Nations  Protec
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  tion Force (UNPROFOR)
</P>
<P>-     Establish Joint Military Commissions
</P>
<P>-     Establish a logistic network
</P>
<P>-     Expand the Tuzla airfield
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two complementary aspects of the overall peace  implementation
mission  civil and military. The civil aspect  includes rebuilding the Bosnian
infrastructure, economic  development, elections, and refugee resettling  not an
IFOR mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The military aspect  the mission of IFOR  is to create a  stable environment
for the civil aspects to proceed. IFOR, including  U.S. forces, will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force by ensuring self-defense and freedom of
 movement for IFOR
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce required withdrawal of forces to respective territories
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Establish a man a zone of separation
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce the cessation of hostilities
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-      Provide a secure environment which permits conduct of  civil peace
implementation functions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NATO and U.S. forces will enforce a peace, not fight a war.  Robust NATO
rules of engagement reflect the philosophy of  sending in a heavy force,
authorized to use deadly force for self  defense, force protection, and to
enforce compliance with the peace plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the U.N. mission, there is no dual key in  NATO's rules of
engagement. Field commanders will have authority to  defend troops under their
command and to ensure compliance  with the military aspects of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFORs first task will be to oversee the withdrawal of  Federation and
Bosnian Serb forces behind the agreed cease-fire line  within thirty days. Once
this is done, IFOR will monitor and patrol a  four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide
Zone of Separation along the  internal boundaries between Federation and Bosnian
Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What Parties Must Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beginning when the peace agreement is signed in Paris on  December 14, the
parties to the agreement  the Bosnian Federation  and the Bosnian Serbs  have
specific time frames by which they  must meet specific obligations, as follows:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     DAY 1 Begin withdrawing forces, removing mines from Zones
 of Separation, making boundaries
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 3 Air defense radar shut down
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 30 Foreign troops (mercenaries, etc.) out of Bosnia.  Military
forces complete withdrawal behind cease fire lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 45 Complete withdrawal behind inter-entity boundary lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 120 Complete withdrawal of all heavy weapons and  forces to
cantonment/barracks areas
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 180 Complete negotiations of arms limits
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Not Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not patrol Bosnia's external borders.
According to  the peace settlement, supervision of Bosnia's external borders
will  be done by other organizations, most likely the International  Commission
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), which currently  performs this function.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not act as a police force. That function will be the
 responsibility of the civilian side of the peace implementation  operation.
IFOR personnel will have the authority to detain any  persons who interfere with
the IFOR mission or those individuals who  may be indicted for war crimes, but
they will not try to track  them down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      IFOR will not be involved in reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, political reform, or human rights efforts. Other civilian  agencies and
organizations will be responsible for those tasks. IFOR  also will not be
involved in arming and training Bosnian  Federation forces, if that becomes
necessary to achieve equilibrium  with Bosnian Serb forces.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>When IFOR Will Leave</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFOR will deploy long enough to give the civil aspects an  opportunity to
take hold and start making an impact on the lives of  the people of Bosnia. With
high confidence, we believe the  military mission can be completed in
approximately twelve months  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  the start of deployment. (If
there were to be a complete  breakdown of the settlement, the President does
have the authority to  withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The civil aspects will continue for many years. However, at  the time of
IFOR's withdrawal, conditions in Bosnia will be  substantially different and
more stable than they are today. The forces  will have been separated, the
territories will have been transferred,  and the cycle of violence will have
been broken. We expect the  newly-elected government to take root and economic
reconstruction to  be under way.

<h3> It's In The Water </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br> 
January 23, 1997

<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I got such a kick out of the following whimsical story, which talk-radio personality Brian Wilson retrieved from the Internet, that I just have to share it with you. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, before you read this, please bear in mind: My purpose in sharing it is not to suggest that responsible, sensible environmentalism isn't something we should strive for. On the contrary, that's the whole point: When environmentalists adopt extremist positions and use government to impose unreasonable restrictions based on unproven "dangers," like the Alar scare a few years ago, they invite public ridicule. In the long run, this hurts their cause, which is a perfectly reasonable one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Anyway, here's the story: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"LONDON:  Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) recently announced the discovery of a new firefighting agent to be used in conjunction with existing ones such as dry powder and BCF (bromine-chlorine-flourine). Known as WATER, it is particularly suited for fires in buildings, timber yards, and warehouses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Though required in large quantities, it is cheap to produce, and can be stored in quantities of about a million gallons in urban areas and near other installations of high risk. BCF and dry powder are usually stored under pressure, but WATER will be stored in open ponds or reservoirs.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Unfortunately, ICI's proposal already is encountering strong opposition from safety and environmental groups. Prof. Connie Barriner has pointed out that if anyone immersed their head in a bucket of WATER, it could prove fatal in as little as three minutes. Each of ICI's proposed reservoirs would contain enough water to fill 500,000  buckets. As each bucket could easily be used 100 times, there is enough water in one reservoir to kill the entire population of the UK. Risks of this size, said Barringer, should not be allowed, whatever the gain. If WATER were to get out of control, the incidents at Seveso or Bhopal would pale by comparison.  What use was a firefighting agent that could kill people as well as put out fires?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"One local official already has said he would strongly oppose granting permission for construction of a WATER reservoir in his area, unless the most stringent precautions were followed. Open pools were certainly not acceptable. What would prevent people falling in them?  What would prevent the contents from leaking out? At the very least, WATER would need to be contained in a steel pressure vessel surrounded by a concrete containment wall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"A spokesman from the fire brigades said he did not see the need for the new agent.  Dry powder and BCF could cope with most fires. The new agent would bring risks, particularly to firemen. Did we know what would happen when this new chemical was exposed to intense heat?  Would it decompose into something even more dangerous?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"An environmentalists group, the Friends of the World, said it had obtained a sample of the new chemical WATER and found it caused clothes to shrink.  If it did this to cotton, what would it do to humans?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"In the House of Commons yesterday, the Home Secretary was asked if he would prohibit the manufacture and storage of this lethal new chemical. He replied that local authorities would have to take advice from the Health and Safety Executive before giving planning permission.  A full investigation is planned by the Major Hazards Group ...
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the whole reason this satirical tale is funny is because the environmental movement has cried wolf a few too many times: Dire warnings of cancer if rats eat enough saccharine to fill Hoover Dam are never going to be taken seriously by sensible people. And we've all heard stories like this by now -- not jokes, but serious situations affecting people's lives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When jokes like this one no longer resonate, we'll stop repeating them.

<h3> Crime Can Be Whipped </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 19, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The federal government has invested billions of dollars in so-called crime-fighting programs -- remember "midnight basketball" and (an alleged) 100,000 more cops on the beat? -- with little or no tangible results. But what can local officials with limited resources do to fight crime in their own neighborhoods?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Plenty, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">recent study</a> by former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Heritage Foundation Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies Robert Moffit. The two have outlined a common-sense management plan that puts local officials in charge of their own reforms. For starters, Meese and Moffit say, hire the best qualified police officers and then have them patrol the high crime neighborhoods. Sound too simple? It worked in crime-ravaged New York City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since 1993, the "Big Apple" saw a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/lect573.html">William Bratton</a>, the New York City police commissioner and architect of the improvements, insisted on simple, relatively inexpensive reforms such as police officers walking the beat in their patrol areas instead of sitting in a station house filling out paperwork, and a zero-tolerance policy for graffiti and public drunkenness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"You don't need to have a bigger policy budget and more overtime to fight crime, just a commitment to the community," Moffit says. Every policy department -- large or small -- can: 
<P>
<ul>
<li>	Target "hot spots" of crime and career criminals. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in a city. Most crimes also are committed by a small criminal class: just 6 percent of the male population is responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p>
<li>Raise the recruitment standards of police officers. Communities must demand the highest physical, intellectual and character standards within the police force and not accept anything less in the name of "diversity." Initial standardized screenings for psychological and physical requirements are essential. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal or incompetent police officers.

<p>
<li>	Have police officers walk a beat, getting to know neighbors and a neighborhood instead of sitting behind a desk or cruising the streets in a police car. Administrative duties should be performed by clerical or support staff to free up officers.
<p>
<li>	Recruit police from the ranks of the military. In addition to getting a "sure thing," in terms of discipline and training, hiring former military personnel increases the pool of qualified minority applicants.
	</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, it doesn't help matters when courts practice "revolving door" justice, allowing criminals back on the streets. Meese and Moffit say lawmakers at the local, state and federal levels should block the appointment of judges who place the rights of criminals over the rights of victims.
For state and local officials the heart of police reform is personnel management: knowing where to assign extra police officers, providing adequate training and hiring only the best and the brightest. "These back-to-basics reforms rely on innovative policing -- not more federal money -- and will have a real affect on fighting crime," Moffit says.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The amazing thing is not that the war on crime can be won by such common-sense measures. The amazing thing is that communities -- large and small -- haven't been doing these things all along.

<h3>A Celebration of Indoctrination</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Okay Sherman, set the Way Back Machine for 1984. President Reagan is running for re-election against Walter Mondale, and he's way ahead in the polls. Sort of like Clinton v. Dole, only the other way around politically.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So one day, one of Reagan's chief economists -- David Stockman, let's say -- represents the White House at a ceremony honoring a couple of teachers from Sacramento, Calif., where Reagan served as governor. What have the teachers done to merit this recognition?  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They have taught their elementary school pupils the wonders of supply-side economics! Public school children are enrolled in a program where they learn the story of "Boom Town" where taxes are low enough so people can invest in the economy. The economy booms, bringing more revenue into government coffers than ever could have come in had taxes been raised. The program is run by the public schools. As Mr. Stockman beams and the network cameras roll, the school kids recite such ditties as "Taxes Are Bad, Taxes Hurt, Don't Let the Feds Take Our Shirts." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, we know how the headlines will read the next day. Front page, full scream in the <i>Washington Post</i>: "REAGAN ADMINISTRATION APPLAUDS INDOCTRINATION OF KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS," with a sub-head: "Children Recite Supply-Side Dogma For OMB Director."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Is this fictitious scenario hard to believe? Not at all. Just move that dial Sherman, up to 1996 and the Clinton administration, and switch the politics around. Almost everything else is the same: On the 21st of October, Joseph Stiglitz, President Clinton's chief economist, represented the White House at an awards ceremony honoring two elementary school teachers, Deborah Shearer and Geanie Davis, from Little Rock, Ark. What had the teachers done to merit this recognition?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They had taught their pupils to spout a message the current administration would love to hear from school children -- and parents -- across the land: Don't cut taxes. Using the taxpayers' money, the teachers had taken it upon themselves to teach children the story of "Ginger Town," "using cookies to drive home the concepts of scarcity and wants," as one account put it. The children had learned ditties like "Oh Scarcity, Oh Scarcity! We Cannot Have It All. We Really Want A Lot Of Stuff, But Sometimes There's Just Not Enough." "We have unlimited wants for goods and services," explained little Kelsie Brown, who learned the term "wants" -- along with other economic jargon -- in kindergarten last year!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"The main message of the program, funded by the school, was that taxes aren't so bad," one report said. "They learned that there are many things that are important that are publicly provided," said Ms. Shearer, who seems to have no idea that government funding is not something ordained by God in the scheme of things. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor does she seem to bat an eye at the idea of using public funds to teach one side of an issue to students whose parents may totally disagree with her position. Ms. Shearer, of course, would be outraged -- and justifiably so -- were the situation reversed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wish you teachers had been more active 50 years ago, because then we would not now be faced with the Dole economic plan," Mr. Stiglitz beamed as reporters scribbled at the pre-election ceremony. No kidding!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And speaking of reporters, there is, of course, one thing different about the two scenarios presented above: If President Reagan's White House had been party to such a stunt, the news media would never have let them hear the end of it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The media reaction to Mr. Stiglitz's celebration of indoctrination? You guessed it.

<title> Why It's So Hard To Save -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Why It's So Hard To Save</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it. Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The flip side is equally clear: If you tax something, you get less of it. For example, a few years back the government slapped a "luxury" tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000. The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up --  throwing their workers into the unemployment line. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less. Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire). The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent. After one year, you've earned $50. Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it. But that's not enough. The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you. It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year. The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency. And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man. The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again. Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort. If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a better way. A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the <a href="http://www.savers.org">Savers & Investors League</a> of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard. IRAs? In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start. He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less. So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<h3>UNITED NATIONS DAY:  NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION</h3>
By Brett Schaefer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
	On Oct. 24, we all were expected to bear witness to the great achievements of the United Nations. The organization and its supporters scrambled to hide its misdeeds and dust off its few accomplishments. But they failed to conceal the truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United Nations, despite the claims of reform by Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the Clinton administration, remains rife with abuse, waste, fraud and ineffectiveness. Topping the list is wasteful spending on both materials and personnel. In a 1995 article, <i>Money</i> magazine revealed that U.N. employees commonly earn more than twice the pay of comparable positions in New York-based private-sector jobs. In addition to their salaries, the roughly 10,000 U.N. bureaucrats in New York receive an array of special perks including rent allowances and education grants for their children. To top it off, it's all tax free. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These lucrative positions are, for the most part, not even being filled with competent individuals. Vested interests regard U.N. jobs as opportunities for nepotism and high pay for little work. U.N. employees are not held to any realistic standards of employee evaluation. The U.N. bureaucracy is populated by individuals who fail to meet the basic requirements of an effective civil service. The evaluation system is so abysmal that the U.N. leadership has tried to reform it at least five times. Yet the current system, under which 90 percent of U.N. employees received "excellent" ratings in the recent past, continues with only cosmetic changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, such employees aren't anxious to have their work habits exposed. In 1995 the United Nations bought a $1 million turnstile security system for its New York headquarters, but never used it. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have recorded the arrival and departure times of U.N. employees. Heaven forbid: They would have had to work an entire day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the full range of problems remains hidden because, until 1995, the world body refused to establish an inspector general's office to root out waste, corruption and inefficiency. When it finally did appoint an inspector general, it did so reluctantly, under threat from the U.S. Congress to withhold funding. Moreover, U.N. officials weakened the office by having the inspector general serve under the authority of the secretary general and by failing to grant the office an independent budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This incredible commitment to waste and inefficiency has spurred the United States -- which provides 25 percent of U.N. funding -- to periodically withhold some of its dues. This has resulted in arrears of approximately $1.2 billion. Congress has refused to pay these arrears until the United Nations pledges to undertake reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United States has chosen the proper course. The world body is in a perpetual state of financial crisis and is cash strapped. Withholding funding is the most effective way to get the U.N. bureaucracy's attention and encourage reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The first step toward reform must be an independent audit. The problems can't be fixed until we know in detail what they are. This can best be accomplished by an independent inspector general with a competent staff and budget immune to U.N. pressure. The U.N. system has resisted past reform efforts and will not refrain from using budget blackmail to manipulate the inspector general's office. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is also imperative that the inspector general have complete access to all U.N. and related agency records. A primary goal of this audit should be  not only to identify corruption, waste, fraud and abuse, but also to identify which of the United Nation's 70-plus programs are worth continuing, which should be eliminated, and which should be transferred to other organizations that can perform them better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only when such an audit is completed and management and organizational reforms have been implemented should U.S. back dues be paid. For the United States to pay in full before reform is implemented would be like giving a child his allowance before he completes his chores. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only after an independent audit has been performed and U.N. operations reformed  can Americans sincerely say "Happy United Nations Day."

<h3>DRUNK ON POWER</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more important to many Americans than presidential debates, congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The proper response of the American people to this punitive level of taxation should be clear: revolt. At least that's what another group of Americans did when the federal government levied an excessive tax on their liquor. It was the Summer of 1794. To protest an excise tax placed on their whiskey three years earlier, angry citizens in the Northeastern states rose up against their federal overlords, tarring and feathering government officials and burning down their homes. Before you try this at home, a word of caution: The feds had a pretty strong opinion about the "Whiskey Rebellion" protesters. They shot them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, it's not likely that we'll see today's overtaxed beer drinkers take to the streets. The reason: Beer drinkers have at best a dim understanding that they're even being taxed. The sales and excise taxes that apply to beer are largely "hidden." Consumers see only the final sales price of beer that rings up on the cash register, never realizing that their $15 case costs only $8.50 before taxes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But just because beer taxes are hidden doesn't mean their effect isn't real, both on beer drinkers' wallets and on the economy. Consider: Since 1990, when beer taxes were boosted as part of a larger tax package, the beer industry has lost 60,000 jobs, according to The Beer Institute. When American brewers pay seven times more in taxes than they earn in profits, it's difficult to retain their workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To add insult to injury, the other taxes that were part of the 1990 package -- notably on yachts, private planes, jewelry and furs -- have all been repealed. This is great for people with disposable incomes of around, say, a million dollars, but it does nothing for the little guy who pays the beer tax (nearly two-thirds of all the beer sold in America each year is bought by households earning less than $45,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Fortunately, relief may be at hand. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., has introduced legislation that would cut the beer tax in half -- back to its pre-1990 level. "Because they are concealed," English says, "these taxes engender little opposition from the taxpayers. But they contribute tangibly to the cost of living for hard-working Americans." No kidding. If you buy just one $5 six-pack a week, by the end of the year you've forked over $112 in taxes to the government. That's more than a full day's work for the average wage earner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, English's proposal is sure to meet with opposition from those who think cutting the beer tax will lead to increased alcohol consumption. These folks -- let's call them liberals -- view the tax code as a powerful tool for bending human behavior to fit their preferences. And at the moment, beer drinking is one activity definitely frowned upon by the wine-and-cheese crowd.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ironies are delicious. Not only do liberals, the traditional advocates of "progressive" taxation, wind up supporting a tax that falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans, but these self-styled champions of "the worker" also ignore the fact that the beer tax hurts an industry that employs 2.6 million people -- everything from assembly-line workers in bottling plants to delivery-truck drivers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it, the beer tax is a raw deal. But don't expect change anytime soon. Maybe it's their nature, but too many lawmakers are addicted to controlling people's lives through levies like the beer tax. In short, they're drunk on power.
<p>

<title>What Would George Washington Say? -- Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>WHAT WOULD GEORGE WASHINGTON SAY?</h3>
By Matthew Spalding<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Imagine picking up your morning newspaper and reading the headline: "President To Resign; Issues Solemn Warnings To Nation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This startling news greeted readers of Philadelphia's largest newspaper on the morning of Sept. 19, 1796, when George Washington unexpectedly announced his retirement from the presidency of the United States. The nation would have been happy to see him continue.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But our first president wanted to set an example for his successors, and as he left public life he offered the nation a document that is one of the greatest in American history. On its 200th anniversary, Washington's Farewell Address -- although remembered primarily for its advice on foreign affairs -- gives us much insight into how he might view America in the 1990s. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In it, Washington warned us of the dangers of Big Government. He told us to watch out for the tendency of government to encroach on individual freedoms and consolidate its power. What American can say this warning has not been justified by subsequent events? "A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position," Washington said. We could add: Any doubt that might be left can be put to rest by assessing the size and reach of the U.S. government in 1996. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Our only defense against an over-reaching, tyrannical government, Washington insisted, is the Constitution's strict limits on government power. Washington said that unless these limits were carefully adhered to -- that is, unless the federal government exercised only those functions specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and by the authority of the people, and no more -- the nation would become vulnerable to "cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Could Americans' distrust of their elected representatives, their sense that government has overextended its proper authority, and that average citizens no longer have enough say in matters that affect them, be the result of disregarding Washington's warning? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party" and the notorious problem of faction. By this he didn't mean what me mean by "parties," but instead what we call "special-interest groups" pushing their own single-issue agendas at the expense of wider, more serious concerns having to do with the common good. He called partisan spirit "a fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	How many times in recent decades have Americans watched in despair as partisanship overshadowed principle in the nation's capital; as one special interest in Congress prevented another from passing a good law? Washington believed fundamental change in a free government comes about not through clever strategies, "hot button" issues or attack ads but by honest deliberation, patient persuasion, and a willingness to put principle above self-interest.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In his Farewell Address, Washington also told Americans that while their Constitution creates a framework for good government, it could only work if the people govern themselves rightly. In the absence of governmental restraints, the people would have to restrain their own passions and prejudices. Washington meant to encourage religion and morality as "indispensable supports" for political prosperity. He cautioned Americans never to expect virtue from their elected representatives if they were not moral, virtuous people themselves.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Two centuries later social scientists are just discovering what Washington always knew: that religious belief and moral education are the surest social inoculation against crime, drug abuse,  illegitimacy and practically every other social ill one can name. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	By ignoring much of Washington's advice, America has moved far down the path he said had "hitherto marked the Destiny of Nations." Today our government is virtually unlimited and out of control; politics is dominated by base factionalism and personal invective; our culture is adrift from the breakup of community and the family; we increasingly question our national purpose and role in the world.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Amidst these seemingly intractable problems, Americans would do well to look to the father of their country -- and the Farewell Address -- for guidance. His "counsels of an old and affectionate friend," as he called them, are as true in 1996 as they were in 1796.

<title>Don't Brake For Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DON'T BRAKE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Tyce Palmaffy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Americans have always looked on the Labor Day weekend as one last fling with summer. For most drivers, that once meant a lot of high-anxiety mileage, as they worried about keeping up with traffic while avoiding ticket-happy state troopers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But no longer. Last year Congress repealed  the National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (65 mph on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds).  Now states can set their own speed limits based on local driving conditions. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For more than 20 years, the Democratic leadership in Congress blocked all efforts to overturn this anachronism. In 1995, though, the tide changed. With their robust commitment to limited government, conservative House and Senate freshmen strongly pushed for a repeal -- and were finally successful when President Clinton reluctantly signed their bold legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the repeal's effective date. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 mph, while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The results? Highway patrolmen and state traffic engineers in Montana and in every other state I spoke with -- 11 in all -- report that average speeds have only increased one to two mph. Fatalities have actually decreased in some states. So much for safety advocates' apocalyptic predictions. 	Patrolmen and traffic engineers -- whose reputations depend on drivers' safety --resoundingly supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable speed limits. According to engineers, the proper method of determining limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The posted speed limit should be the speed that 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, drivers set the speed limit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 mph speed limits were unreasonably low -- often five or 10, and sometimes 15 mph below this driver-imposed maximum. The feds, of course, set the low limits in the name of safety. Yet, when people drive at the 85th percentile speed, they "are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," according to engineer Tom Hicks of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, says when the driver-set maximum was 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, "drivers weren't comfortable -- some drove 55, some 65, some 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. 	
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also undermine police effectiveness. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 mph limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking -- a law that threatened rather than improved safety. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 mph speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- such as undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 mph speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed," says Bill Jackman, a representative of the American Automobile Association. "If the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." With repeal of the federal limit, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.	The repeal of the national speed limit may even signal new attitudes in Washington. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others?

<h3>Wasting Your Money </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With all the talk in Washington about slashing budgets, cutting deficits and axing federal programs, you'd think it would be hard (or at least harder) to come up with stories about government waste, fraud and abuse. After all, these are the first things Congress and the White House would do something about ... right?	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wrong. Despite Congress' best efforts to trim the pork, big government is alive and well. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider:<ul>
	<li> Auditors for the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently discovered that the Baltimore Public Housing Authority had purchased eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers; hired a security firm that employed 29 convicted felons; and sold more than $25 million-worth of contracts for building repairs to contractors, some of whom were friends or relatives of Authority employees, without allowing competitive bidding. In spite of these irregularities, HUD recently awarded the housing authority $115 million more to construct 338 new apartment units.<p>
	<li> According to the General Accounting Office, the official auditing arm of Congress, the U.S. Export-Import Bank gave large bonuses to 200 of its 448 employees -- even though only 10 were eligible. Of five federal agencies reviewed for such "bonus abuse," the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force -- but accounted for one-quarter of all bonuses government-wide! <p>
	<li> The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, citizens of Spain, are two of America's richest sugar barons. Their fortune is estimated at $500 million. Because they are considered "domestic growers," the Fanjul brothers also are "entitled" to a government-enforced import-protection subsidy that adds about eight cents per pound to the cost of the sugar we buy. How much of our money are the Fanjul brothers pulling in from this subsidy each year? A cool $65 million.<p>
	<li> Financial mismanagement in the District of Columbia is legendary. In 1994, for example, Lloyd Arrington Jr., president of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), collected a $17,000 bonus on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 for parking and $600 for rented formal wear, dinners and entertainment. By the time his now nine-year old EDFC -- created to loan money to promising businesses 3/4 was audited in 1994, it had made only 17 loans, or less than two per year.<p>
	<li> HUD (again) funded and sponsored a "training session" for 260 public housing tenants and HUD employees in 1995 -- at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort! "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!! Casinos for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing & Touring etc. ... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals," read the invitation. Cost to taxpayers for a "training session" later found by the HUD Inspector General to lack "programmatic substance" (in other words, it was a boondoggle)? $325,000.<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's more -- much more. Like the new $373 million air-traffic-control system -- installed at 16 airports and destined for 47 -- that has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures. It has failed nearly once a week at Washington's National Airport. Or the Public Health Service physician who complained recently to <i>The Washington Post</i> that he is being paid $117,000 per year, plus a $15,000 bonus, to do absolutely no work at all. He made the front page. Or the $280,000 taxpayer-funded study now getting underway in Seattle to determine if a chemical widely used in sexual lubricants makes sex safer for homosexuals. Yes, you read that correctly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe now you can understand why Congress was willing to go to the mat with the administration -- to the point of allowing the government to shut down temporarily -- over federal spending. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These horror stories are just a few of the boondoggles that have been uncovered. Just think what remains hidden from view. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>Truth in Testimony</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html"> Edwin Feulner </a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is it that only liberals care about children and the needy, while conservatives seem more concerned about the well-being of defense contractors? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I ask this loaded question because it says a lot about the advocacy game as it is now played across America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While many groups and organizations do essential, valuable work in communities across the nation -- often without credit or notice -- many national "charity" groups have their hands in the pockets of taxpayers. But this is okay because they "care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the recent "Stand for Children" rally in Washington, organized by the Children's Defense Fund and led by Marian Wright Edelman,  a good friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and a leading proponent of the spend-more school of social welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The CDF's idea was flawless. By using the theme "Stand for Children," CDF made it almost impossible for anyone to question its agenda: more government spending. To do so would appear, "against children." By dubbing this approach "non-partisan," the stage was set for a liberal welfare establishment-media lovefest, with conservatives as the main course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives didn't roll over and accept defeat. Instead we showed that the liberals' motives are not always as pure as they would have us believe. In the case of the "Stand for Children" rally, many of the organizations pushing the rally are on the public take -- receiving a grand total of at least $392 million in taxpayer funding in fiscal year 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No wonder these groups argue so passionately about the need for greater federal funding and are so vicious in attacking anyone who might question it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, these are the very same groups that line up to testify whenever Congress holds hearings on whether welfare spending should be cut. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If that sounds like a conflict of interest, that's because it is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What makes the scam possible is that these groups are not required to reveal the fact that they are feasting at the public trough. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An organization might be getting 90 percent of its money directly from the federal government, and it can still go before Congress -- and the TV cameras -- and argue for more money for this program or that, without ever revealing that it is a recipient of federal funds. No wonder the welfare states keeps expanding. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's no need for a new law, no need for the president to sign legislation to rectify this situation. All the Senate and House of Representatives have to do is change their own rules so that all advocates before Congress must state how much money they receive from the government. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a "Truth in Testimony" rule, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) appearing before House and Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization received $76 million from the federal government in 1993. This just might tend to shed a new light on AARP's heart-rending requests for more spending on programs for the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, union officials testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to reveal that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe some day the media might even catch on and report on the vested interests of many who regale Congress with pitiful tales of welfare woe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Until then, taxpayers should demand that lawmakers ask tax-funded "charities" two simple questions: "What's in it for you?" and "How much is it going to cost the taxpayers?" These are two questions Congress and the media have ignored, at least so far.

<h3>LABOR PAINS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

	This Labor Day the country will kick back, fire up the barbecue, and take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of America's working men and women. But will those workers themselves have anything to celebrate?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is, sadly, not much. Despite a seemingly rosy employment picture -- more than 11 million new jobs since 1991 and an unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent -- the real outlook for U.S. workers remains rather grim. Scratch below the surface of these numbers, and the much-discussed economic anxiety felt by America's workers becomes perfectly understandable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For starters, job layoffs are continuing at a blistering pace. In the first six months of 1996, 271,000 Americans lost their jobs, the second-highest number this decade. Layoffs were 28 percent higher than during the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent higher than in 1993, the largest "downsizing" year of the decade.  So far this year, thousands of jobs have vanished in important industries such as telecommunications (43,000), computers (22,000), and automobiles (18,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's more, even those workers able to find new jobs are taking it on the chin: Weekly earnings in their new positions are averaging 8.2 percent less than in their old jobs. For workers aged 45 to 55 -- those with home mortgages and kids in college to support -- the pay cuts are averaging an even higher 14 percent. And to add insult to injury, nearly one of every five displaced workers lands in a new job that doesn't even offer health-insurance coverage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even these folks are better off than the large number of workers who can't find new jobs at all. The fact is, the long-term unemployment rate -- which measures the number of jobless Americans out of work for six months or more -- remains at a stubbornly high 18.5 percent. Compare this with the average of 10.3 percent during the three previous U.S. economic expansions.  Even out-of-work white-collar managers and other professionals have been having a rough time; nearly one in five is still unemployed after six months of searching.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What about those workers lucky enough to hold onto their jobs? Here, too, the news is less than upbeat. Adjusted for inflation, full-time workers' paychecks haven't increased for five years. For men, real weekly earnings have actually dropped by 5.1 percent, and for black and Hispanic men the drop has been even worse, 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The decline in weekly earnings can be partly explained by the disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Since March of 1995, the economy has shed more than 280,000 such jobs. In fact, fewer manufacturing jobs exist today than when the economic recovery began five years ago. In addition, the number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related jobs has dropped by 478,000 since 1992, the number working in administrative support and clerical positions has fallen by 298,000, and the number working in precision production, craft and repair occupations has declined by 13,000 (and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14 million reached in March of 1990). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What all this adds up to, predictably, is anxiety on the part of the American worker. Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe jobs are not very plentiful, according to the Conference Board's most recent survey of consumer confidence, and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's face it: For many American workers President Clinton's declaration that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in 30 years" rings hollow. They seem to understand instinctively what many economists have been saying -- that the Clinton economy's growth rate of slightly more than 2 percent a year is not sufficient to produce a large number of good, stable, high-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is, the economy can grow much faster than it has these past four years. We experienced growth rates of 3.5 percent for most of the 1980s, and the economy produced 19 million new jobs. But that was during a period of lower taxation and fewer regulations on business.  In the current era of high taxes and heavy regulation, 2 percent growth and sluggish job creation may be the best we can hope for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And that's nothing to celebrate.

<title> Socially Responsible Business - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> Socially Responsible Business </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	The tragic ValuJet crash this spring, according to critics of corporate America, shows once again how the profit motive devalues and debases our society. If only ValuJet management hadn't cut corners to squeeze every possible nickel out of the system, the critics argue, the tragedy never would have happened. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Against this backdrop, let me recommend a new book to you: John Hood's "The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good," published a few weeks ago by the Free Press. Hood's book continues an important discussion launched some 35 years ago by the late John Chamberlain in "The Enterprising Americans." Chamberlain's book was a portrait of the towering figures of American enterprise -- the "robber barons," some called them -- who made America the great innovative industrial power it remains today: Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, Cyrus McCormack, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Chamberlain's point was simple: That the achievements of American business should inspire all of us, as he put it, "not because the pursuit of business is a sanctified end in itself but because it palpably makes the achievements of higher ends possible." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But do GM, Hewlett-Packard, K- Mart, TWA, Wendy's and other U.S. corporations have a responsibility to society beyond providing goods and services and generating profits?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Advocates of corporate "social responsibility" -- popular on college campuses, in Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlors, at Grateful Dead smoke-ins, and in government regulatory agencies -- argue that companies have an obligation to fight injustice, promote the public's health, diversify the workplace, eradicate poverty and save the planet, either directly, through corporate philanthropy or (most typically) by order of Big Brother. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While most of these are worthy goals, Hood demonstrates, as Chamberlain did before him, that business does more good for more people in more ways simply by sticking to business. In a Policy Review article previewing his book, Hood put it like this: "The corporate social-responsibility movement harbors an unrealistic, ahistorical view of commercial activity," focusing on disasters and villains, while ignoring "the revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider just one small example: the U.S. gold-mining industry. As economist Michael Evans of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management noted in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal article, "private investment, new technologies and enlightened management" have turned the state of Nevada into the world's fourth-largest gold producer over the past 15 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The industry now provides nearly 60,000 high-paying jobs in the state, is known for its "unmatched educational, health and other benefits," and  pays some $120 million per year in state and county taxes. The industry also has spent billions of dollars on equipment built by other U.S. companies, generating additional jobs in other states. With the world demand for gold soaring, even better days could lie ahead.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Except for one fact: Washington doesn't appreciate the contributions of this "heroic enterprise." The government has restricted exploration, discouraged investment and placed a variety of other regulatory burdens on the industry. The net result: If current policies are not reversed, 40,000 mining-related jobs will disappear over the next decade. In two decades, the industry itself will disappear, according to Evans' research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In many ways, the corporate social-responsibility movement is a red herring. As Hood notes, the best corporate citizens are those who create the jobs and amenities we enjoy and "the innovations that make our lives safer, healthier and happier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I hope you will read Hood's "Heroic Enterprise." It will restore your faith in our system.

<h3> Dumb And Dumber</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A certain Mr. Wade Miller of  New Mexico recently called Atlanta's Olympic committee to buy tickets for the Summer Olympics.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"I'm sorry, sir," the voice on the other line replied. "I can't sell tickets to someone outside the United States."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yep -- you heard correctly. The sales office of the U. S. Olympic Committee didn't know that "New Mexico" isn't part of old Mexico. Though he tried, Mr. Miller could convince neither the operator -- nor her supervisor! -- that New Mexico is one of the 50 United States of America. The supervisor, getting on the line when Mr. Miller insisted, told him (you can just hear her tone), "Sir, new Mexico, old Mexico -- it doesn't matter. You still have to go through your country's Olympic Committee." 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When reporters from a Santa Fe newspaper asked for tickets, they were told -- once again -- to contact the Mexican consulate.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When I hear stories like this, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. At first, of course, I laugh -- I mean, it is funny after all. But then I start thinking about why it's funny. And then, I become a little more pensive. If people with so little basic knowledge are able to get jobs with the U.S. Olympic Committee -- as supervisors no less! -- it makes me wonder how many other people like this there are out there, and where they work. A nuclear reactor, maybe? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason we laugh, of course, is because something we all secretly know has been exposed without warning, in all its irony: Our "education system" is now so bad it no longer transmits even the most basic knowledge to a great many people. And those people are becoming such a large proportion of the population that they now show up as employees of organizations as prestigious as the U.S. Olympic Committee.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm not exaggerating or overreacting here. I have a friend who used to be a television news reporter, who once took his camera and crew to the University of Maryland. He wanted to ask university students simple, basic knowledge questions in categories like geography, history, math and science to see whether they knew things anyone at that educational level ought to know. Some of the answers he got will make a believer out of anyone.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two female students tried for a full minute to come up with the formula for finding the area of a rectangle, and finally gave up with embarrassed giggles. One young man couldn't say what part of the world Poland is in. Another simply walked away when asked what, for him, was apparently the stump question: Who was president of the United States during the Civil War?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"What three powers did we fight against in World War II?" was one question. To be fair, my friend says a few came up with the correct answer, with a few hints along the way: Germany, Italy and Japan. Then there was the young man who said, in a confident tone (my friend tells me this is a direct quote): "Well, the first one, I know, is Russia. The second one is Korea. And the third one, I understand, is Pearl Harbor."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pearl Harbor? What on earth is going on here? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A student at a major U.S. university, and he not only can't answer a simple history question every American should be able to answer -- he doesn't even understand what is said to him? Pearl Harbor isn't a "power." It's a little country in the middle of the Atlantic; everybody knows that!
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have to wonder who signed a certificate of graduation from high school for this young man. What "educator" admitted him to a university? And how did he stay there, after he got there?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The answer is simple, and not funny: He's a product of the same politically correct, "socially conscious" educators who have presided over the decline in American education during the past three decades. The reason they have resisted all change in their approach to education is also their great secret: they see this decline as a positive good. After all, academic excellence is just a form of elitism. It will be a great stride forward for social equality when everyone is on the same, dumbed down intellectual level. 	 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What I want to know is: Who should District of Columbia residents call to get tickets to the Olympics? Atlanta -- or Bogota?

<title> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action </h3>

By Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A well-financed, pro-affirmative action propaganda campaign is underway to defeat the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), an amendment to California's constitution that would prohibit the state from granting preference -- or discriminating -- on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sex. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Much of this pro-affirmative action, anti-CCRI campaign is focused on women.  The obvious reason: Women are a bigger voting bloc than minorities, the usual target of such campaigns. If most women can be convinced that race- and sex-based preferences are fair, that could decide the battle. And this is a battle whose outcome could easily affect the lives of both men and women across the nation.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's why it is important to understand why women should reject race- and sex-based "affirmative action." There are at least four reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	First, like men, women believe in equality before the law. They believe racial, ethnic and gender preferences violate the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and voting booth have come not by departing from this creed, but by upholding it -- by showing that America wasn't living up to its own principles of equality. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. No one is better placed than a woman to see the double-edged nature of racial and gender preferences. It is clear to a mother that an institutional preference for her daughter is institutional discrimination against her son. Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys, made precisely this point in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. "I find affirmative action and the like racist and sexist ... Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of unequal opportunity toward our sons."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, women themselves often are treated unfairly under affirmative action plans. Consider the case of Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A Los Angeles resident, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she accumulated a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 -- on a four point scale -- due to credit for advanced placement classes. In addition to working 15 hours a week, McDonald wracked up an impressive list of achievements and awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry. She is exactly the kind of candidate the University of California at Berkeley claims to be looking for: high-achieving, well rounded, but poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In March 1996, McDonald received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." In other words, "diversity" was more important than excellence. Had it not been for the intervention of a lawyer so outraged by McDonald's case that he offered his services pro bono and threatened the University with a lawsuit, Lydia would not be looking forward to spring admission.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from affirmative action, but from equality of opportunity and hard work.  A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of quota-based affirmative action. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from such preferences.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Women have made progress in all segments of the work force in the last 30 years. As Anita K. Blair, executive vice president of the Independent Women's Forum recently pointed out, the most important reason is that women went to college. In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. During the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees -- M.B.A.s, M.D.s and J.D.s -- by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of affirmative action, but of changing personal choices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. Women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned nearly 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Those fighting the California Civil Rights Initiative are saying, in essence, that  women need the government's help in order to compete. But the facts do not support this view. Women should not fall for the sophistry and hypocrisy of organized interests who actually benefit from the perpetual racial and sexual strife caused by affirmative action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all, a society where equal rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial to women as it is to men. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Americans who think there's a liberal lilt to the news reporting they hear and read every day no longer have to rely on us cranky conservatives for affirmation. The evidence is now overwhelming. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When asked their political philosophy in a recent survey, 61 percent of 139 Washington bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents said "liberal" or "moderate to liberal." Just 9 percent said "conservative" or "moderate to conservative." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost nine out of 10--89 percent--said they voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. This compares to just 7 percent for George Bush and 2 percent for Ross Perot. As for party affiliation, 50 percent said they were Democrats, just 4 percent Republicans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As for journalists nationwide, 56 percent of the 2,703 surveyed in a huge Los Angeles Times poll conducted in 1985 called themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal." Just 18 percent said they were "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative." Several other studies by media analysts Robert and Linda Lichter, among others, have shown substantially the same. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Does this necessarily mean journalists allow their political beliefs to bias their news coverage? Of course not. But it sure raises certain suspicions when these cool, detached "professionals" get things wrong in a way that makes the conservative Congress look bad and the liberal White House look good. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Take just one example: the debate last year over reforming Medicare, the health-care system for America's 37 million senior citizens. Everyone by now knows that Medicare is rapidly going bankrupt and has to be reformed: There is no choice in the matter. But when conservatives <I>tried to slow down the built-in rate of increase</I> in Medicare spending--not cut spending, mind you, just slow down the rate at which costs are going up--congressional liberals accused them of making mean-spirited "cuts" that would hurt the elderly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did the media respond? Although reporters were shown repeatedly that over seven years Medicare spending would increase by $100 billion over and above current levels--from $4,900 to $7,100 per person--the vast majority of media reports told readers and viewers that the conservative plan would "cut" Medicare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Backtrack three years, to the debate over President Clinton's liberal health-care reform scheme. That plan would have increased Medicare spending at the same rate as the 1995 congressional plan. Yet, the media didn't assail the president for "cutting" Medicare. Like congressional conservatives, President Clinton took pains to make it clear his administration wasn't "cutting" the program, saying: "Medicare [is] going up at three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare cut." The media took the president's explanation at face value. Two years later, they pounced on Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The double standard has become so obvious few bother to deny it. In fact, many observers are beginning to recognize that the "talk radio" phenomenon has come about precisely because there is such a wide gulf between what people know to be true and what the media frequently tell us is true. Would Rush Limbaugh have 20 million listeners if Americans had been hearing both sides of the issues for the past several decades? I doubt it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Talk radio is the steam valve for political discourse in contemporary America. Liberals--not consciously, but effectively nonetheless--have been holding down the lid for decades. But the pressure became too great. Liberals stopped paying attention to one little outlet--AM radio--and all the steam came blasting out in a "rush" (sorry, I couldn't resist).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 So next time a news report gives you the sneaking suspicion that the reporter is spending too much time chatting with Kennedy clones at liberal cocktail parties, you're probably right. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, for some balance, tune in to talk radio.

<h3> Politicking On The Workers' Dime</h3>
By Edwin Feulner<br>
President,  <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The silly season, otherwise known as the fall elections, is fast approaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And once again, one of the greatest travesties in American politics will be played out: Millions of Americans will be forced to help candidates and promote political positions they don't agree with. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How can such a thing happen in modern-day America? After all, isn't this the land of the free? Not if you're a rank-and-file union member in most states.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For years, big labor has engaged in one of the most undemocratic practices imaginable: using the dues workers must pay to the union as a condition of employment for partisan politicking. This year, with a friend of big labor in the White House, union officials are being more open about it. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney announced a few months ago that his organization would pump $35 million (seven times the amount unions usually spend on elections) into a nationwide campaign to unseat Republican congressmen he considers hostile to organized labor. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two-thirds of the $35 million Sweeney plans to spend defeating Republican officeholders will come from a special "tax" that was imposed on union members in March. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia do not have right-to-work laws. This means working people can be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If they don't like the political choices of union officials, they're out of luck.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The money that organized labor admits spending on partisan politics is vastly overshadowed by various "in-kind" expenditures unions make on behalf of candidates or causes. The late, great labor reporter Victor Riesel several years ago estimated that big labor spends $10 on political mailings, phone banks and other "in-kind" services for every dollar it openly spends on elections. You do the math.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Virtually all this money goes to Democratic candidates and incumbents. Yet, in 1994, exit polls found that 40 percent of union members voted Republican, for the very pro-family, tax-cutting, budget-balancing Republicans Sweeney and his colleagues have targeted for defeat. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So what's  a union member to do? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For starters he or she may seek inspiration from a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In  the case of <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, union member Harry Beck objected to the fact that his union dues were being used to fund political activities he didn't support. Beck challenged his union and won. The court ruled that union members can get refunds on that portion of their dues not devoted to costs associated with collective bargaining. In Beck's case, "that portion" was found to be 80 cents out of every dollar. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, when President Clinton took office, he weakened the impact of the Beck decision by rescinding former President Bush's order that required notices be posted in the workplaces of federal contractors, notifying workers of their rights under Beck. Clinton ordered the notices be torn down. So much for being on the side of workers!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Union politicking is nothing new and unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. However, fair-minded citizens should ask whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities--including helping candidates--with which they may not agree. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is not a partisan issue. If you're a liberal or a Democrat, all you have to ask yourself is how you would react if the tables were turned: How would you feel if John Sweeney planned to spend $35 million in coerced union dues to help Newt Gingrich and his allies? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	You'd be pretty angry.<p>

<title>Restoring Religious Freedom to Public Schools -- Heritage</title>

<h3> RESTORING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>
By Joe Loconte<br>
Deputy editor of  <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;





	Parades, fireworks, barbecues -- it's that time of year when Americans celebrate their bold, 220 year-old experiment in democracy and political freedom. When it comes to religious freedom, however, many people will not be in a celebratory mood.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider: An Illinois school district recently banned any reference to God in student presentations at a commencement program. A California high school prevented students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia barred a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While some Americans accept such bans as enforcement of the principle of separation of church and state, others are up in arms over what they consider outright religious persecution. Due to efforts by religious conservatives, Congress may soon unveil an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent educators from muzzling permissible forms of religious speech. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues -- and a religious conservative -- isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to the First Amendment. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "We still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Making it "work" means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, and Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, work district by district, getting educators and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, or of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debates must always be conducted with respect.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for Rights, Responsibilities and Respect), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Educators Association International, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Texas and Utah -- are moving ahead with the initiative.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, if the program can work in California, it can work anywhere. The student bodies in some California districts speak 90 different languages -- and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Haynes and Thomas have met with school officials and community leaders throughout the state. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and build community support. If  this sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is -- and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Snowline School District in Southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for a church-state debacle: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; officials hesitated when a school board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library; a parent objected when a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the community, trained in the Three Rs program, was ready. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. Rather, it is the government's -- and hence, the public schools' -- religious speech that is restricted. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad," Vondra says.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now there's a lesson in liberty: that neither pluralism nor separation of church and state need hush freedom of speech -- even religious speech -- in our public schools. <p>

<title>The Recovery of American Citizenship -- Heritage</title>

<h3> THE RECOVERY OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><br>
Editor of <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When America's founding fathers talked about "citizenship," they meant people -- not political elites -- taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities. This Fourth of July, Americans should think about joining a movement that would restore the founders' vision of how Americans solve their problems.  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm talking about the "citizenship" movement, which aims to rein in Washington so the energy and effectiveness of state and local government and private alternatives to government can be explored to the fullest. One of America's core objectives during the next 20 years should be to recover this tradition of American citizenship. We must restore the link between freedom and personal responsibility, the two great themes of modern conservatism, and an increasingly attractive idea to liberals beginning to see the futility of government solutions. Our hope is that we can overcome much of the divisiveness and incivility that has characterized political discourse over the past several decades.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the principles of the United States: the rule of law, the decentralized government promised by our Constitution, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This distinctively American tradition of citizenship was best described by the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in "Democracy in America," his classic book of 1832. Tocqueville described America as the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were more important -- and more powerful -- than politicians in addressing the problems of their own communities. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is not to say Tocqueville's America wasn't marred by some terrible evils -- most notably the scourge of slavery. But there also were many things of which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison could be proud. It was a republic of self-governing citizens, which is what the founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence from England and wrote our Constitution.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To revive the founders' dream, it is essential to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But just as liberals must learn to accept this fact, conservatives must understand that merely tearing down the Washington establishment will not be sufficient. It is also essential to strengthen the families, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, local governments and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed federal-government programs.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Revivals of private initiative have happened before. The second half of the 19th  and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. A similar wave of social entrepreneurship will sweep America in the next generation. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recovery of American citizenship is the most important unifying principle for Americans in the post-Cold War era. It appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, non-governmental institutions. It appeals to those with religious values who emphasize faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, this idea appeals to nationalists who want to restore a strong sense of American cultural identity. And it appeals to liberals and their love for community activism.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Without local institutions," wrote Tocqueville 160 years ago, "a nation may give itself a free government, but it does not have the spirit of liberty." It is time for all Americans to help rebuild the local institutions that will bring back our spirit of liberty.<p>

<title>Really Stand for Children: Fix Welfare -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
REALLY STAND FOR CHILDREN: FIX WELFARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Senior Analyst for Welfare and Family Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Recently, the nation's capitol was the  scene of  the "Stand for Children" rally organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund. The rally's proclaimed goal was to call attention to the plight of the nation's children; its unstated goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and to criticize those in Congress who have sought reform. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the rally was correct to call attention to the plight of many of  America's children, the irony is that children are suffering because of the governmental policies supported by the rally's organizers. Children are suffering because the liberal welfare state has carpet-bombed the moral foundations of  the inner city, toppling marriage, gutting the work ethic, and leaving a rubble of social pathology in its wake.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The failure of the War on Poverty stems from its flawed premise: a core belief  that "material poverty" is critically harmful to children. According to this view, welfare, by reducing material poverty, can  increase children's well-being and lifetime attainment.  Similarly, since poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, an eroded work ethic, and drug use -- greater welfare spending can readily reduce poverty and most social problems at the same time. From this simplistic logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The "Stand for Children" rally repeated this tired theme.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But history refutes this naive belief in welfare. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If it were true that "material poverty" causes social problems, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods than we do today. On the contrary: Crime, family breakup and most other social problems were nowhere near the levels they are today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families -- not family income -- are what determine children's achievement. Successful families tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education and marriage, which they pass on to their children. Attempting to raise family income artificially through welfare does little to benefit a child, but does a lot to destroy the very values that are key to a child's success.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point many liberals refuse to recognize is that welfare has behavioral side effects. It engenders dependence and illegitimacy, both highly injurious to children's development. For example, among the nearly 5 million families currently receiving AFDC benefits, the total time spent on welfare will average nearly 13 years. A 1994 report by June O'Neill, currently Congressional Budget Office director, shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. O'Neill makes clear that welfare dependence, rather than poverty, is what truly hurts children. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
          	By paying women more money when they have children out of wedlock, welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy, a fact acknowledged by President Clinton but ignored by the "Stand for Children" organizers. Being born outside of marriage and raised in a single-parent home triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children; nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity; doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and doubles the probability a boy will engage in criminal activity and wind up in jail. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We can't help America's children by continuing past mistaken policies. The current welfare system must be replaced; the automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. In the future, welfare no longer should be a one-way hand out; adult recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. And steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen moms. 
 <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We must begin to focus on institutions with a record of success, not failure.  Religious institutions have been dramatically successful in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. One way to give the poor access to this fountain of hope would be to give poor parents education vouchers they could  freely use to send their children to private schools, including religious schools. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Americans should remember that well-meaning, big-government liberals who call welfare reformers "anti-child" are the unwitting advocates of precisely what is hurting America's children: welfare.<p>

<h3>
JERRY-RIGGED FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
.

	The Clinton administration is about to make the same mistake in Bosnia it made in Somalia, where 18 U.S. Marines died unnecessarily. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House recently announced it would expand the role of the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia to include scouring the countryside for war criminals. This is something the administration specifically promised not to do, a role that was purposefully left out of the Dayton Peace Accords because of its divisiveness and its potential for indefinitely expanding the Bosnia mission and producing casualties.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is the administration taking this step? It wants to apprehend Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both still exercising control over Serb-held territory. And no wonder: If these two are not apprehended, it will be difficult for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to sanction elections scheduled for September, as called for in the peace accords. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Without elections, no stable government will be established in Bosnia. With no government, withdrawing U.S. troops, as President Clinton promised, may not happen. In other words, the house of cards the president set up in Bosnia could come crashing down. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, if by November election time it doesn't look like U.S. troops will come home soon, the president's Bosnia policy will be revealed for what it is: a jerry-rigged, politically tuned deal that puts U.S. forces at the mercy of events that can spin out of control at any time. To avoid this perception, the White House apparently is willing to risk substantial U.S. casualties -- both Karadzic and Mladic travel with 50 to 60 heavily armed escorts. But if Americans die, a la Somalia, the backlash could be even worse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The whole mess is typical of the foreign policy ineptitude shown by this administration from the beginning. The Clinton team, influenced by its opposition to the Vietnam War, came into office confused about which situations warrant U.S. military intervention, and which do not. It became clear that the president believed  multinational peacekeeping was the wave of the future for U.S. foreign policy. The administration appeared more comfortable with the idea of "foreign policy as social work." This global utopianism led the president to commit America to dubious peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, with sometimes tragic, never satisfactory results. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans realize how many gross errors and misjudgments have been made in foreign policy. Consider:<ul>
	<li>The White House has wasted precious years during which America could have erected global anti-missile defenses. For less than $3 billion it could have upgraded the Navy's Aegis fleet air-defense system as many experts have proposed, spending another $5 billion later on space-based sensors. Instead, the administration has done nothing in the face of CIA estimates that at least 20 countries already have or may be developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.	
	<p><li>The Clinton Pentagon determined that America needed to be able to fight two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously." Yet the president has neglected to provide the funding needed to sustain this capability. 
	<p><li>The administration has zig-zagged on China policy, at times threatening, at other times appeasing, sending confused signals throughout Asia that have undermined U.S. credibility in the region and heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. 
	<p><li>The administration secretly tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro whereby Cuban boat people would be sent back forcibly to Cuba instead of being allowed into the United States. This betrayal of the Cuban people -- overturning 30 years of principled U.S. policy -- was only abandoned after Cuba shot down two U.S. civilian aircraft.   
	<p><li>The White House has organized a multi-billion-dollar deal that will give North Korea two nuclear reactors -- and still we don't know for sure whether Pyongyang has discontinued its budding nuclear-weapons program. 
	<p><li>In Haiti, America spent $2 billion to put in office an avowed Marxist  known for his hostility to the United States, all in the name of "restoring democracy." Whatever it is, the regime now in place is no democracy. 
<p>	<li>Finally, with no U.S. interests at stake, the White House sent U.S. forces to Bosnia, when it could have simply lifted the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and allowed them to defend themselves. Now, worried that failure in Bosnia could threaten its standing in the polls, the White House is playing with the possibility of expanding and lengthening the mission, thus unnecessarily placing U.S. forces in even greater danger.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	This is no way to conduct foreign policy.<p>

HOW TO AVOID THE NEXT BUDGET CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
Vice President for Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	For months now, Congress has been in retreat after being blamed for two partial government shutdowns, the result of its battle with President Clinton over the fiscal 1996 federal budget. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lawmakers are now scurrying to accommodate the president's spending priorities to avoid an election-year bruising over the 1997 budget, even as they try to preserve enough of their own agenda to save face. But no matter how hard they try, they are going to find themselves in yet another battle royal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why?  Is America doomed to suffer government shutdowns year after year, depending only on how vociferously Congress and the White House disagree on budget priorities, tax and spending policy?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not at all. As it turns out, there is a perfectly good reason why Congress and the president seem perpetually at loggerheads over the budget: Because the law is written in a way that makes this inevitable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the 1974 Budget Act, a Watergate-era attempt by Congress to limit the power of the executive branch, the president is excluded from the budget process until it's almost over -- a recipe for the kind of 11th-hour budget showdowns that grabbed the headlines for so many months.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's how it works. Each January the president sends a budget to Capitol Hill, which Congress promptly ignores. In the spring, Congress adopts its own budget resolution based on its own priorities. During the summer, Congress crafts the 13 detailed spending bills needed to meet the budget targets outlined in the resolution, as well as a reconciliation bill making changes in tax and entitlement policy. Finally, in the fall, usually just before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, Congress sends the budget bills to the president, who now has only one way to try to restore his spending priorities: veto the bills and force an end-of-the-year budget fight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The result: With insufficient time to negotiate the details, the government shuts down over a dispute about whether or not Medicare premiums should rise by $6 a month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, the Budget Act also forces spending to go up even if Congress doesn't want it to. When members of Congress sit down to figure out how much to spend on a program in the coming fiscal year, the Budget Act mandates that they take last year's spending level and automatically add in the cost of population growth, anticipated inflation and other factors. This becomes the new "baseline" for spending, which means that even if Congress does not vote to increase the budget for a program, spending increases will happen anyway.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Any member of Congress who proposes to increase spending on a program by less than the baseline projection is accused of "cutting" the program. That's how Congress' plan to boost spending on Medicare by $100 billion over seven years became a "cut."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A reform plan proposed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., would fix the problems created by the Budget Act of 1974. For starters, the budget resolution adopted by Congress in the spring would be a legally binding law, signed by the president, and would set a limit on how much the government can spend in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the resolution would have to pass by an early date, April 15, in Cox's plan.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As a result, Congress and the president would know more than five months before the start of the new fiscal year exactly how much money they have to work with.  This would give the two sides a strong incentive to get the big, controversial budget issues (like tax cuts and entitlement reform) out of the way first, greatly lessening the chance of a last-minute deadlock forcing a government shutdown.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Cox plan also would purge the budget process of the pro-spending bias created by "baseline budgeting." Year-to-year spending totals would be compared in real dollars, not in the inflated dollars of the baseline. No longer would advocates of higher spending be able to call a spending increase a "cut." Spending hikes would be out in the open, rather than buried in the dark recesses of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The United States has experienced numerous budget crises over the past decade -- in 1986, 1988, 1990, and again in 1995-96. Add to this the bias toward higher spending written into the Budget Act and it's clear the time has come for reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why wait for the next budget crisis to expose (yet again) the flaws in the current system? If Congress wants to end the saga of government shutdowns and impose some real spending control, it should fix the system now.
<p>

<title>The March For Big Government -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
THE MARCH FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Kenneth Weinstein<br>
Director of the Government Reform Project<br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	On June 1, 1996, national attention will focus on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C.  The theme of this march, ostensibly, is something that all Americans can support: "a day ... to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Organizers of the "Stand for Children" claim between 200,000 and 1 million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial "in a non-partisan call to action."  Unfortunately, the principal "action" likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. The reason: More than 100 of the sponsoring organizations are direct federal grant recipients receiving more than $392 million annually. The actual figure is assuredly higher, since that total excludes grants to many affiliate organization as well as all funds received from state or local governments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand's call "to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children."  But an examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children is not a non-partisan, pro-children march. It is a stand for government dependency and ought to be dubbed "The March For Big Government."  Consider:
<ul>
	<li>The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) -- an organization once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, is a chief opponent of  the 104th Congress' efforts to reform welfare.  In 1973, Edelman admitted that because she no longer could stir up interest in government programs by speaking of "poor people," she would emphasize children.  "Children," after all, "might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change."
<p>	<li>Lobbyists appear to be a major constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying groups that push for greater spending on federal programs already costing more than $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service boondoggle, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (The Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in fiscal year 1995). Families USA, a key lobbying organization for Bill Clinton's failed big-government health-care plan, is also a march endorser.
<p>	<li>At least 20 national organizations representing government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, also will be participating in the march.
<p>	<li>The AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative members of Congress this year, is actively promoting the march. Thirty-three of its affiliated unions are serving as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to "take back the Congress" (take it back for whom?), two guests were invited to speak: one was Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. Obviously, she got what she was after.
<p>	<li>At least 50 liberal organizations with no special focus on children, including the Americans for Democratic Action, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, are co-sponsors of the march.
 <p>	<li>As if to remove all doubt about the government-oriented nature of this event, one federal agency has even gotten into the act directly.  The Agriculture Department's $932 million Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service has signed on as a national endorser of the Stand For Children under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. Also, the Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corp., has signed on to the march.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In short, the Stand For Children is yet another a venue for groups that live off the taxpayer to lobby for more money. It is common practice for such organizations to use sympathetic symbols -- yes, even children -- as a "cloaking device" for efforts to expand big government and the welfare state. The fact that few Americans can believe anyone would be so cynical only makes the "cloaking" that much easier. In this case, they want to present their rally as a spontaneous, non-partisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.

<title>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996 - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Presidential advisor James Carville, the highly regarded Democratic political operative from Louisiana's bayou country, helped keep the 1992 Clinton campaign in focus and "on message" with a simple four-word phrase, "It's the economy, stupid."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the White House is smart, this will not be its theme in 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though the White House and national media have been trumpeting the economy's "unexpectedly strong" (as The Washington Post put it) 2.8 percent first-quarter gain, this is modest growth by normal standards -- and voters remain uneasy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Flash back four years: With the American economy just emerging from a two-year recession in the fall of 1992 and many Americans nervous about their economic prospects, Carville's one-note samba -- played over and over again throughout the campaign -- clearly helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House, forcing George Bush to retire to his beloved Texas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to run for re-election. And though the economy is not moving backward (the definition of a recession), it's not setting any speed records either. Fifty percent of major U.S. companies trimmed their payrolls in the 12 months ending June 1995, some of them significantly. Indeed, from March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public -- especially the nearly 8 million people who are working two or more jobs to make ends meet -- know something is amiss. And they are concerned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration's initial response was a mix of denial and cheerleading: the silly claim that the economy is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The White House has had the good sense to back off a bit from this claim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A new study shows why.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">study</a> was conducted by economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> using a highly reliable computer model of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What the model does is simulate economic activity. By feeding the many "variables" that affect the economy into the model -- from changes in tax and budget policy to data on population growth and other demographic factors -- a seasoned economic forecaster can predict future economic activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach and Hodge turned the clock back to January 1993, before the new administration pushed the $241 billion tax hike through the 103rd Congress. Without getting into all of the mind-numbing technical details, they then ran the model on "fast-forward," asking it to tell them what the economy would look like today if tax and budget policy had not been changed in 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What they found was not good news for the White House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They found that another 1.2 million Americans would have jobs today if the economy hadn't been saddled with the tax increase. They learned that the U.S. auto industry would have built and sold an additional 1.1 million new cars and light trucks. And they learned that the typical U.S. wage-earner would have taken home an additional $2,600 in after-tax income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The big numbers are equally disturbing. For example: The overall U.S. economy would have grown an additional $208 billion between 1993 and 1996. And business investment -- the key factor in creating jobs -- would have been $42.5 billion higher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While there has been some quibbling about the exact details of the Beach/Hodge findings, the overall thrust of their work remains unchallenged: Tax hikes hurt, and the huge 1993 tax hike hurt big time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the Clinton administration wonders why American workers are still uneasy about the economy, they should tell the White House: "It's the tax hike, stupid!"

<h3>Your Right To Know</h3>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. 	Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government  --  and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called "The Right To Know Payroll Form."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Right To Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans With Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security.        
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. 	Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look moneywise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out  --  in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right To Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, all the rest is taken out  --  Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92.  	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government  --  much of it before they even know about it  --  they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Are Conservatives Winning Or Losing? -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>ARE CONSERVATIVES WINNING OR LOSING?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, many Americans thought it was time to dance on the grave of big government. Instead, conservatives themselves bogged down in a bitter eight-year political war with dozens of special interests -- from farmers to welfare workers -- who depend on big government for their livelihoods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When conservatives took control of Congress in 1994, many of us again thought we had scored a victory for smaller government. Wrong again. President Clinton gave as good -- or better -- than he got from the new Congress. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, over the past year big government has continued to get bigger. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't until the president's 1996 State of the Union declaration that "the era of big government is over," that I truly began to believe conservatives finally had won. After all, when an opponent is forced to mouth words he doesn't believe, words that go 180 degrees in the direction opposite his political leanings, in short, the very words his opponents have been saying, this is when he has lost the war -- at least the rhetorical war -- the war of ideas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives will have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of territory they gain in the next few years. Liberalism has not surrendered; and we'd be naive to expect it to. After all, it's just too much fun spending other people's money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, those Americans who were really paying attention had a rude awakening following President Clinton's grand declaration about big government's demise. Untrue to his word, the president's first request to the returning Congress was for $8 billion in new spending for the current fiscal year. His fiscal year 1997 budget offered more of the same: a $358 billion increase over the levels proposed in Congress' seven-year balanced budget plan. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All these efforts will have to be strenuously opposed, and in years to come, gleefully overturned. In the meantime, conservatives will have to buckle down and think about what it means to govern. After all, the Republican Congress has encountered some rough going of late. Is this any surprise? Legislative governance -- that is, passing laws that do what you want them to do -- is not easy. It's like trying to herd cats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatives are unaccustomed to running Congress; they've been backbenchers for decades. This requires an adjustment. It requires a period of learning. There is nothing inherently disgraceful in the failure that comes from such learning -- except not learning.  	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, the conservative agenda articulated in the House GOP's Contract with America remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps too much was attempted. Perhaps compromise was dismissed too easily in the fervent desire for real change. Perhaps the message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media. These are understandable, forgivable mistakes. I say learn and move on.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What do conservatives need to learn? For starters, when they campaign against each other in primaries, they have to stop attacking other conservatives for espousing great conservative ideas. For example, the defining issue of the 1996 presidential campaign should have been -- and still could be -- the <a href="/heritage/taxsite">flat tax</a>. One candidate, so intent upon defeating flat-tax candidate Steve Forbes that he was willing to say practically anything, called the flat tax idea "nonsense." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tell that to Hong Kong, whose flat-tax economy has been the most consistently expanding in the world for the last 30 years! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax is one of the most marketable, most urgently needed -- by Americans of all income levels -- ideas conservatives have proposed in decades. Yet, in their pursuit of political gain, conservative candidates obscured the issue in a flurry of flying fur. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatism's message has been confused in the past year, by the rough and tumble of Washington politics. But that can be remedied. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberalism's message, on the other hand, has become utterly irrelevant to America's aspirations and values. It is beyond redemption. That's why liberals have to cloak themselves in conservative rhetoric just to get a hearing. This bodes well for the future of America. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The principles of conservatism -- free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense -- don't change in the middle of a presidential election or a budget battle. They don't change whether Republicans are in power or Democrats are in power or whether that power is shared, as is presently the case.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I am optimistic about conservatism because what we believe is enduring. I am optimistic because liberalism is a disaster that can no longer be disguised. I am optimistic because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not wishful thinking. And I am optimistic because people genuinely want to get this country back on the right track. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America.

<title>Clinton's War on the Armed Forces - Heritage Commentary
</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Clinton's War on the Armed Forces</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	President Clinton has said, "the era of big government is over." But so far, it looks like it's over for only one area of government -- national defense. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration is looking for a 6 percent cut in the 1997 defense budget. While that may not seem like much, it will further starve an already hungry armed forces wizened by nearly a decade of consecutive budget cuts.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider this: The president wants to cut procurement  -- purchasing of parts, machinery and equipment our troops use in the field on a daily basis -- by $3.4 billion. Yet, when adjusted for inflation, procurement is at its lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War. It hasn't been trimmed -- it's been hacked with a meat cleaver, by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now some of you may be thinking, "Hey, the Cold War is over. Communists are now nothing more than cabana boys in third rate dictator-run countries like Cuba. What could be wrong with a major downsizing of our military? The United States doesn't need to be a super power when there is no other super power to worry about."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The only problem with this line of thinking is that while the magnitude of danger may be less -- no one threatens us with total annihilation the way the Soviet Union once did -- the volatility of danger is much greater. Rogue nations working to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- don't care if the United States is a super power. All they care about is bullying their way onto the world stage -- and they're getting the weapons to do it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recognition of this, the Clinton administration itself has said that the United States needs to be able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously. Yet, the White House has failed to provide the funding that would enable the Pentagon to meet this goal. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to procurement, the Pentagon's "operations and maintenance" budget is being bled to death -- siphoned off into areas not related to combat readiness. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia between 1992 and 1995 have cost American taxpayers some $6.6 billion. None of these missions contributed one iota to U.S. security.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the American military is being weakened by starvation. Consider: In 1995 the Pentagon was not allowed to buy a single new tank. By the year 2005, every tank in the Army will be older than the soldiers driving them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't too long ago taxpayers were told that Pentagon chiefs favored hammers costing hundreds of dollars and toilet seats that should have been gold plated for what we paid for them. There was no excuse, of course, for such excess. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But essential investments in the day-to-day operations of our fighting men and women --  and combat readiness -- should not be confused with the waste of the past.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	President Clinton does the armed forces a disservice when our soldiers and sailors go without essential training because equipment is broken and there are no parts to fix it. Pentagon chiefs are now regaled with stories of maintenance crews "cannibalizing" other pieces of equipment to make Band-Aid repairs on equipment that has worn out.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton administration wouldn't have committed the United States to being able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously if military planners didn't consider such a scenario -- say in Korea and the Middle East, for example -- a distinct possibility. But if the Pentagon isn't given the training, equipment, spare parts and supplies it needs, it can't fulfill this mission.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or, our fighting men and women can be thrown into the middle of a conflict without the proper support, and we can just hope for the best.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is this the administration's military strategy?   <P>

<title>Environmental Flip Flops - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Environmental Flip Flops </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Liberal activists once again have used the occasion of Earth Day to scare people into believing the environment is in such bad shape that more government programs are needed to "protect" us. One favorite theme is the alleged global population explosion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the last five years alone, U.S. newspapers and magazines have published more than 7,200 articles on this subject. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, the latest rave in environmental circles is a new book claiming a devastating drop in male fertility over the past half-century, threatening our very ability to reproduce. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OK, so which is it? Are we about to overpopulate ourselves to death, or die out as a species? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As most Americans realize, environmentalists are constantly sounding the alarm about something or other. Fortunately, most of us know instinctively that a healthy dose of skepticism is in order -- that the doomsday stories are a bunch of baloney (itself alleged to be a health hazard, because of the chemical preservatives in the meat).  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all of the stories involve highly complex scientific issues that a nonscientist can't possibly understand. Which is why its so important to put things in perspective. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The newest "danger" on the horizon involves a somewhat racy subject: sperm. According to the new book, various chemicals in our diets and environment are wrecking havoc with our genetic material, lowering global sperm counts to dangerously low levels and threatening the future of life itself -- man and animal alike.   
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the overheated publicity materials being sent out by the New York publisher, studies have documented "as much as a 50 percent drop in human sperm counts over the last 50 years." Oh really?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Predictably, supporting the book's claims (here's where perspective is important) are some of the same people who have been hollering the loudest about global overpopulation, urging the United States to support United Nations and Planned Parenthood birth-control efforts. Now, instead of financing condoms for Chile and Chad, America is supposed to do something about the fertility deficit in Fiji and France.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is precisely the kind of contradictory flip-flop confusion that raises skepticism about the entire environmental movement.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, the agenda of environmental alarmists is the same as it has always been: Convince the American people that modern chemicals are deadly and evil and stampede the government into spending more money on more programs that will further restrict our choices and freedom.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bottom line, of course, is that environmentalists can't have it both ways. We can't have a global population explosion and a fertility crisis at the same time. As Mr. Spock of "Star Trek" might put it, "It doesn't compute."

<title>How Much Is $1.6 Trillion - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>HOW MUCH IS $1.6 TRILLION?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	With six kids and a single income, I am probably more aware than most where my paycheck goes. One thing I know for sure is that too much goes to government.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government this year -- despite the much-ballyhooed "cuts" the Washington establishment has been bemoaning -- will spend some $1.6 trillion. The House of Representatives will begin debating spending targets for fiscal year 1997 during the first week of May. Make no mistake: Overall spending will go up, not down.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even though I have worked in the nation's capital for more than a dozen years, eight of them on Capitol Hill, two at the Pentagon, and six at The Heritage Foundation, where we routinely analyze programs costing tens of billions of dollars, I don't have the faintest idea how much $1.6 trillion really is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For most of us, even a million is incomprehensible. Have you ever tried to count to a million? Think about it: If you counted non-stop without eating or sleeping it would take approximately 23 days to count to a million. To count to a billion literally would take a lifetime: 95 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Counting to a trillion, assuming we get started right away and don't waste any time, would take about 2,000 centuries -- 200,000 years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us can at least imagine counting for 23 days. A period of 2,000 centuries, on the other hand, is beyond human understanding. As is a trillion dollars.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, government doesn't just count money, it spends it -- and it does so at a phenomenal rate: $4.5 billion a day. Enough to support my family and quite a few others for a very long time.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A lot of the money government spends is borrowed, more than half-a-million dollars per minute, $32 million an hour, or $768 million a day. This borrowed money gets added to the national debt.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite two very costly world wars, it took from the beginning of the American Republic until 1982 -- more than 200 years -- to amass the first $1 trillion in debt. By February 1996, however, the debt exceeded $5 trillion. On April 19, when I last checked, the "national debt clock" on the Internet stood at $5,147,684,202,607.46. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's five trillion, 147 billion, 684 million, 202 thousand, 607 dollars and 46 cents: More than $19,450 for every man, woman and child in the United States, a whopping $155,000 for the Mason family -- enough to purchase a new house and pay a year's worth of college tuition, with money left over.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The story doesn't end here, however. Unless something drastic happens, government spending and borrowing will get worse. Under the current budget, annual government spending will increase to $2 trillion by the year 2002 -- just six years down the road. The debt also will increase: by approximately $150 billion per year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, this spending spree is now largely on autopilot. The cost of mandatory "entitlement" programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, already the largest portion of the budget, will increase 63 percent by the year 2002, while interest payments on the national debt will increase 16 percent. The remainder of the budget, meanwhile --  for national defense, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, maintenance of U.S. ports and parks and everything else -- will grow a relatively modest 14 percent.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unchecked, this crowding-out effect would reach its destructive conclusion in 2010 -- the year my seven-year-old reaches the age of 21 -- when entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time somebody says government spending needs to be brought under control you'll know why. If you forget, just start counting. I'm sure you'll remember long before you reach 5 trillion, 147 billion.

<title>The Truth About Free Trade and Protectionism - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There's a notion afoot that free trade is hurting the U.S. worker, that it is causing corporations to downsize and lay off their employees, and that the answer is for the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions against foreign countries like Japan. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In reality, this would be very unwise. History and economic common sense show that the "trade wars" approach to the world marketplace simply doesn't work. Consider the following myths: 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<b>Myth #1</b>: Free trade has allowed manufacturers to go overseas to obtain cheap labor, destroying America's manufacturing infrastructure and losing American jobs. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If U.S. manufacturing companies were moving overseas in droves, manufacturing as a percentage of the total U.S. economy would have suffered a steep decline. Instead, it has maintained a constant level of about 21 percent of the total economy for three decades. And if cheap labor were the big draw people like Pat Buchanan and H. Ross Perot say it is, U.S. companies would be invested up to their eyeballs in countries like Haiti, Somalia and the Dominican Republic. Obviously they're not, or these countries wouldn't be destitute. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #2</b>: We must protect high-paying manufacturing jobs from foreign competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: Not if such protection costs an even greater number of jobs in other industries and causes consumer prices to rise. Consider for example, U.S. import quotas on automobiles, which caused the price of new American autos to increase by 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. The auto industry claims these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs. But they also reduced sales -- by about 1 million cars. This drop forced some 50,000 layoffs by the late 1980s. In other words, even though protectionism saved some 22,000 jobs, it caused a net job loss of 30,000.  Some "protection."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: America by far is the world's leader in technological innovation and is the world's largest manufacturer of computer microprocessors, semiconductors, advanced consumer electronics, health equipment, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer software, and host of other information technologies and high-tech products. Over time, competition from other nations like Japan is making us do better, not worse.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #4</b>: U.S. trade deficits -- especially with Japan -- mean America is becoming poorer while others become richer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If this were true, the United States wouldn't be the economic powerhouse it is today. The real reason the United States has a trade deficit with Japan is because there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese. In order for America to have a trade "balance" with Japan, each and every Japanese would need to buy twice as much from America as Americans buy from Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: History shows that as the U.S. trade deficit increases, unemployment actually decreases. For example, as the U.S. trade deficit leaped in 1983-84 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted. Conversely, when the trade deficit shrank, from 1989 to 1991, unemployment began to increase. The reason some major companies lay off large numbers of workers has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with burdensome regulatory policies here at home.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6</b>: U.S. companies will go under unless the government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign governments to purchase more U.S. goods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: U.S. companies who use this scare tactic to stampede lawmakers into passing protectionist policies are trying to protect themselves from competition, both foreign and domestic. If American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter? The U.S. auto industry -- so beat up by the Japanese years ago -- is now winning. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year and is making cars that are better built, have fewer flaws and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. They have free trade to thank, not government meddling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, while it may be tempting to blame other countries when U.S. companies downsize or lay off  workers, there is no evidence that free trade is hurting us, or that "trade wars" are the answer. Rather, it shows that free trade is the road to prosperity.

<title>How Republicans Can Win the Environmental Debate - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE</h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Earth Day (April 22) was painful for Republicans. Unless they develop a new strategy on the environment, they will continue getting "gored" on the issue. Not because they failed to communicate their vision, but because they don't have one.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton administration sent its troops to the congressional districts of vulnerable Republican freshman in Congress to blast them on their environmental record. "Green" activists similarly conducted a media blitz attacking the "anti-environment" GOP.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberals have been successful at portraying the new Republican Congress as "planet pavers" who want to "roll back" environmental protection laws, all to satisfy polluting industrialists who contributed to the GOP's political coffers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans, meanwhile, have been waging the environmental debate almost exclusively with  regulatory "horror stories"-- tales of real Americans suffering under oppressive environmental laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These anecdotes work, but only to a point.  For example, most Americans would react with anger to the story of Earl Miller, my own dry cleaner in Arlington, Va., who lost his family business after 30 years because he could not afford a new (and largely unnecessary) $40,000 machine required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Republicans have relied too heavily on such stories. As much as Americans  want the government to stop harassing people, they fear (understandably) that if the "regulatory safety net" disappears, we would return to the days of billowing black smokestacks and burning rivers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the Republican message so far -- that we need to balance environmental protection with the demands of economic growth -- has fallen like a lead balloon. Many people are convinced the argument is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even though environmental regulations cost the U.S. economy an incredible $171 billion annually, balancing this cost against a child's life is a losing proposition. Unless  Republicans can show that their policies protect jobs, eliminate unfairness, and do a better job protecting the environment and public health than the big-government approach, environmental issues will continue to be their Achilles' heel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is, well intentioned liberal environmental policies can kill. For example, according to a Harvard University study, current regulatory policies cost 60,000 lives per year. Why? Because the government squanders huge sums of money guarding against minuscule risks -- the theoretical loss of life due to trace amounts of chemicals on fruits and vegetables, for example -- while it ignores much greater risks. Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis calls this "statistical murder." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Superfund and property rights reforms before Congress provide excellent opportunities to improve the environment and save more lives. Under the hazardous waste "Superfund" cleanup program, created in 1980, only about 20 percent of the 1,374 sites on the list have been cleaned up. Lawmakers should let people know they want to accelerate cleanups that are now delayed because trial lawyers -- big allies of the White House -- soak up 21 percent of Superfund's money. More lives would be saved because of faster cleanups of the worst sites posing the most risk to Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, Republicans should explain that protecting the rights of property owners can actually benefit threatened species. Right now, under the Endangered Species Act, regulators can financially ruin families by taking away their ability to use their land, without compensation. This is unfair and counterproductive. It creates an incentive for property owners to make sure no one finds out about endangered species that may live on their land. The bumper sticker "shoot, shovel, and shut up" tells the whole story.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans must recognize that the American people legitimately expect freedom from harmful pollution. That doesn't mean they should embrace the  environmentalist agenda, which opposes letting businesses find the best way to comply with environmental safeguards, and is hostile to free-market solutions. It does mean, however, that they must publicly acknowledge that polluting a neighborhood is not a conservative value. They should stress the need to prioritize risks and explain why market approaches often work better than regulations -- not only for preserving liberty and economic growth, but for the environment as well. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy and a clean and healthy environment. Republicans can win the environmental debate if they meet this challenge, and give people all three. With a positive vision, they can do just that.

<title>Clinton's New Budget: And the Winner Is..Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>CLINTON'S NEW BUDGET: AND THE WINNER IS ... BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The new budget President Clinton released this week was supposed to attack big government. Big government won.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over seven years, President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget proposes $358 billion in higher spending and $232 billion in higher federal tax revenues than the balanced budget submitted to him by Congress last fall, which he vetoed. That amounts to $3,580 in higher spending and $2,320 in higher tax revenue for every household in America. So much for "the end of big government."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what about the deficit candidate Clinton vowed to slay within five years if elected? Compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the president's new budget adds $125 billion in new red ink through the year 2002.  That amounts to increasing the debt burden on every household by $1,250.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But give the president credit -- for some exceptionally brazen budget gimmickry. On paper, his fiscal year 1997 budget balances by 2002, but only by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.  Consider:  The White House budget purports to save nearly $600 billion over seven years, but only 40 percent of those savings would come during Clinton's second term in office, if he wins.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, it's a lot easier to balance the budget when some other president will bear the brunt of responsibility for deficit reduction. Under the 1997 Clinton budget, the first president and Congress of the next century would have to find 63 percent of the savings -- not just from political lemons like foreign aid, but from favored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not only does the president leave the spending mess for someone else to clean up, he hogs popular tax cuts for himself. Under his budget, middle-class families would get a tax credit for each child, increasing in value from $300 in 1997 to $500 by 1999. But in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget, Clinton's child tax credit vanishes.  The result in that year: an $18 billion tax increase on families with children. But this doesn't worry the White House either, since some future president will have to deliver the bad news.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What's more, the president's budget offsets these tax cuts with big tax increases.  All told, the White House budget contains $99.7 billion in tax cuts and $62.4 billion in tax increases.  New taxes exceed the president's proposed seven-year Medicaid savings ($59 billion) and surpass by half his proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion).  In the end, the net tax cut is $37 billion, or just 3 cents of every $1,000 taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And let's not forget: This is the same president who said he would work with Congress to craft some kind of capital-gains tax cut.  But not only does his budget propose no such tax cut, it calls for $4 billion in higher capital-gains taxes over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, the president's budget treats entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare -- the real engines behind uncontrolled spending growth -- with kid gloves. In fact, spending on entitlements steams ahead by $370 billion, or 50 percent, over seven years.  For all "mandatory" programs, spending would grow from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar in 2002.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This threatens not only the country's solvency, but the future of entitlement programs themselves.  In less than 15 years, spending on entitlements and debt interest will consume nearly every dollar in the federal budget, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform headed by Sen. Robert Kerry, D-Neb., and retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The president's response? His budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over seven years -- not nearly enough to save the program from collapse.  For Medicaid, the situation is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, runaway costs could force states to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion. And the president's proposed "reform" -- placing a cap on how much the federal government will spend per Medicaid beneficiary -- could slap $47 billion in new costs on already cash-strapped states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is one area of the budget, however, where the White House does propose real change: spending on presidential "pork" gets a big boost. Clinton's budget outlines a sweeping agenda of new spending initiatives on priorities important to politically influential special-interest groups: education (teachers' unions), high technology (corporations) and the environment ("green" activists). Compared to Congress' balanced budget, the president would shovel an extra $106 billion over seven years to programs supported by such groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it. The president's budget -- while claiming, technically, to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- is just more obfuscation, smoke and mirrors. It is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it.

<title>The Unfinished Agenda on Unfunded Mandates - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>THE UNFINISHED AGENDA ON UNFUNDED MANDATES</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	One year after Congress passed a law to deal with the problem of "unfunded mandates," the results are not encouraging.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans have any idea that Washington forces all sorts of laws and regulations on state and local governments -- concerning everything from storm-water drainage to health care for illegal immigrants -- without giving states and localities so much as a penny to pay for them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State and local government officials and business leaders met recently in Washington to examine the preliminary recommendations of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). This is the body Congress assigned last year to examine how "unfunded mandates" are hurting state and local governments, as part of its <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?r104:./temp/~r104uCqz::+@1(S.+1)++">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the ACIR's recommendations show, unfunded mandates are still busting state and local budgets, diverting much-needed money from law enforcement, fire fighting, education and other activities people really need. In short, Congress accomplished little with last year's reforms. This should come as no surprise. After all, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/11?r104:./temp/~r104YVpC::unfunded+mandates+reform+act+">
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995  did absolutely nothing to address existing mandates -- except to have the ACIR study them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the study is proving useful. Based on information from the National Governors' Association and dozens of other state and local governments and organizations, ACIR identified 14 mandates it sees as the biggest problems. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The report recommends that seven federal laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, no longer apply to state and local governments. Another seven laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, should be made more flexible or be funded more by the federal government instead of forcing state and local governments to pay.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the report has its shortcomings. It doesn't say anything about how unfunded mandates affect the private sector and whether reforms should extend that far. There also are countless environmental, health and education mandates the report doesn't address. And while the ACIR acknowledges that laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act may not have a legitimate scientific basis, the ACIR's report doesn't reach into whether the laws themselves should be changed. Asking Congress to exempt states and localities from laws that are ill-conceived in the first place sets a bad precedent and creates a double standard for treatment of the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the ACIR report just scratches the surface of a huge problem. Costly requirements imposed by Washington are undermining the fiscal health of state and local governments. For example, every three years the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify 25 new substances localities must test for in their water supplies -- forcing cities across America to bear the cost of testing for substances that literally have been banned for decades. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another example: A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cb22.html">study</a> by The Heritage Foundation showed that state spending on Medicaid will increase from $32 billion in 1990 to $104 billion in 2002, a 325 percent boost, if there is no reform of the current program. States like California and New York will have to raise additional billions just to pay for their share of this program.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfunded mandates can force states to raise taxes; reduce spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement or some other service; or both. For example, in September 1995, Fairfax County, Va. reported that half its non-school budget is being consumed by programs and mandates issued by Congress and the Virginia General Assembly, for which the county receives no funds. In February, the county executive was forced to propose one of the largest tax increases in the county's history, as well as dramatic reductions in education and social service programs.. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite their limitations, the ACIR recommendations should give states and localities hope. They confirm that the burden of unfunded mandates is real and significant. The ACIR's final report could create the foundation for a new round of legislative initiatives. These could range from full federal funding of mandates to outright repeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	However, if state and local communities expect change, they will have to continue badgering Washington through legislation and the courts. Unless states and localities are vigilant in keeping Congress and the president focused on addressing the problem of unfunded mandates, there will be no reform at all. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Washington will be all too happy to keep passing the buck.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Drifting Toward a Taiwan Crisis - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRIFTING TOWARD A TAIWAN CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 8, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a blatant show of intimidation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is now firing missiles at targets just miles from Taiwan's largest cities.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The missiles are intended to undermine the Republic of China on Taiwan's democratic government -- which will hold its first-ever presidential election on March 23.  
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And why shouldn't the PRC feel perfectly free to bully one of America's best friends in Asia and its 7th-largest trading partner? After all, the Clinton administration has done little to give China pause as to the consequences of such acts. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, instead of clearly spelling out what America's response would be if the communist Chinese attack Taiwan -- thus discouraging such aggressive acts -- the blundering Clinton foreign policy team has lent encouragement to the Chinese. For example, an unnamed State Department official told U.S. News & World Report last October that U.S. military action was unlikely. "We would not be in a position to react with force," the official was quoted as saying. "We would not elect to do that, I'm sure," he added.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Certainly not. Of course, a 12-year-old could figure out that even if this were true -- which it shouldn't be -- you don't go telling a potential adversary about it. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration not only shouldn't be saying such things, this should not be its policy either. The administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan, period. Nor should it rule out the use of force if the Chinese decide on such a reckless course. In fact, instead of standing by while the PRC lobs missiles in Taiwan's direction, the United States should be holding naval exercises in the region: to send a message of our own. Instead, when the U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz made a run through the Taiwan Strait in December, administration officials -- who could have just kept their mouths shut! -- were quick to assure all parties that the move was due to inclement weather in the Pacific. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By failing to tell China's leaders where America stands, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could enslave the citizens of Free China, place every U.S. ally in Asia at risk, and wipe out what little confidence our Asian allies might still have in our reliability in a crisis. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before it's too late, President Clinton must make sure Beijing understands that America feels a moral obligation to defend Taiwan, and that it will do so, come what may. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After all, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- U.S. law -- states that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." The president should reaffirm that it will regard violations of Taiwan's rights as a threat to U.S. security and will act accordingly. He should tell China it could face not only severe economic sanctions -- ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo -- but also the full military might of the United States.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such steps should be taken now, before the real shooting starts. After it starts, America can only lose. Even if a PRC-initiated attack on Taiwan didn't spread any further -- and there's no guarantee that it wouldn't -- China would have successfully challenged America's ability to protect its allies. Other challenges would follow, in Asia and elsewhere.      
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the reason China is threatening to come to blows is that it's scared of tiny Taiwan. Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States last June -- to speak at a class reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University -- China has been rattling its saber. Chinese amphibious and airborne military assault exercises involving 20,000 troops, 40 ships and 100 aircraft -- designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan -- preceded the island's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway now. China fears that Taiwan will be seen as a model for political reform on the mainland, and is resentful of Taiwan's growing economic prosperity, based on a Western-style free market. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most portentous of all, the PRC may be preparing for a more decisive confrontation with Taiwan in the future. In a speech Jan. 30, Premiere Li Peng said that "During the period [1996-2000] ... settling the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese people." Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that "the important role to be played by the Army in taking back Taiwan," was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the face of such challenges, President Clinton so far has chosen to hide his head in the sand. This makes America appear weak, not just to China, but to Taiwan and our other Asian allies as well. If America doesn't even have the nerve to talk tough to China before a crisis erupts, why should anyone believe we would defend Taiwan with force in the event of an attack? 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There need not be a military crisis over Taiwan. All it would take to insure that it doesn't come would be some tough talk and a little saber rattling of our own. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What's so hard about that?

<title>Why We Should Be Worried About Russia - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 February 29, 1996<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Russia has the potential to become a far more dangerous and unstable adversary than the Soviet Union ever was. Yet, as the April summit between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin approaches, U.S. and international policy-makers seem oblivious to developments that daily make a future belligerent regime in Russia more likely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $10.2 billion loan, and the U.S.- run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Clinton strongly endorses the IMF loan, hoping it will bolster Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will only encourage Russia on its destructive course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If a hard-line communist like Gennady Zyuganov were to carry the presidential election this June, which looks increasingly likely, IMF credits would be going to precisely the kind of regime that could resume threatening the United States and Europe with nuclear weapons. There is a chance that these loans would never be repaid since, under a communist government, Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economic reforms in Russia are grinding to a halt. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining radical reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics, whose power and influence are gaining strength. Vladimir Kadannikov, Chubais' replacement, directed Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, in 1995 Russia's inflation rate raged between 120 and 130 percent, budget deficits remain very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading Yeltsin administration officials such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, along with communist deputies in the Duma, are seriously considering reversing privatization and stopping economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, election pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to powerful industry groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry and $2.2 billion in back wages has been promised to public-sector workers. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion; $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector; half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and more than $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces. All of these are panic-driven political payoffs by a frightened regime fighting for its survival.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to be providing policy advice to Russian leaders on decreasing tax rates to boost private enterprise and encouraging investment to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Only when investment, both foreign and domestic, is able to create prosperity for the Russian people will the tensions tearing the country apart be eased.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has become such an investment risk that more than $12 billion a year is leaving the country  to be deposited in foreign banks. Such capital flight -- the result of incoherent economic policies -- is starving the Russian economy of investment and taxable income and creating political unrest. Even as it asks the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving sizable debts owed to it: $8 billion owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi; $3 billion owed by the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua; and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, Russia continues to prosecute the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war is costing more than $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most ominous of all, the country may be on the brink of a takeover by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the unreformed communists who has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  Leading in opinion polls, he is followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared he will restore the Russian empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration should not lobby the IMF on behalf of Russia. More money  is not what Russia needs. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by a future anti-Western leadership. Instead, President Clinton should take the lead in ensuring that all aid to Russia is conditioned on the adoption of free-market and democratic reforms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Otherwise, the foundation for a Russia more dangerous than the Soviet Union will continue to be laid.

<title>Raising the Bar - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>RAISING THE BAR</h3>
By Nina Shokraii<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the debate over affirmative action about to begin in Congress, opponents of racial quotas and preferences should be ready to offer a better way of creating opportunity for racial groups that have been victims of discrimination.  The answer is high academic standards for everyone.
<p> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics.  Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending a message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that when there are high expectations, black and Hispanic children can meet them.  Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores are artificially raised to compensate for racial status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Take, for instance, the experience of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School, located near the site of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.  Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American.  But by the end of the sixth grade, Esquith's students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight Shakespeare plays.  His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.  Their performance of "Measure for Measure" will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class?  The same way outstanding teachers always do.  He sets high standards and gives his students the help they need to meet them.  Esquith begins teaching his class at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.)  By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile and the district in the 47th percentile.  On the English test, they produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language. If not for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grassroots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math.  Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra vs. Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.  Lerner believes schools should make the minimum competence exam the standard for grade-school graduation and also should require children to pass an advanced competence test like the Scholastic Aptitude Test to graduate from high school.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests.  According to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, only 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test.  And of these 17 states, only New York  has made significant strides. Thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City.  Although the results of the first year reveal a rise in course-failure rates among African-Americans and Hispanics, the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of affirmative action present myriad empowerment ideas, such as school-choice vouchers, when challenged to offer alternatives. But as the experiences of teachers like Esquith demonstrate, promoting high standards has proven to boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The best kind of affirmative action is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.

<title>Why the Budget Debate Matters  Heritage Commentarya</title>

<h3>WHY THE BUDGET DEBATE MATTERS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 15, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CBO, OMB, baseline budgeting, reductions in the rate of 
growth.  To most Americans the budget battle between Congress and the White House has been 
impenetrable, a duel over accounting methods "explained" in acronyms only the initiated can 
understand.  No wonder many Americans are tuning out, or worse, focusing on the only part of 
the debate they can grasp -- the partisan sniping.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a shame. The budget debate is the most important 
political discussion this nation has had in a generation -- a debate over what kind of country we 
want the United States to be.  On one side are those who want the federal government to possess 
unlimited resources, the better to fix every conceivable social problem the country might face.  
For debate purposes, these are the liberals. On the other side are those who believe the federal 
government's power should be strictly limited, the better to preserve personal freedom and allow 
individuals to keep what they earn.  These are the conservatives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The budget is the battlefield on which these two visions for 
America clash, and no issue highlights the divide between these two camps more boldly than 
taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For conservatives, the tax issue boils down to one simple 
question: Whose money is it anyway? If, as conservatives believe, the money people earn 
belongs to them, then taxes should be kept as low as possible.  Which means current tax rates 
need to be cut.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Liberals focus on a different question: How will tax cuts 
affect Treasury receipts?  The measure of tax "fairness" is not whether Americans are forced to 
pay too much, but whether the government has all the "revenue" it needs to run its myriad social 
programs. In this view, the American people not only have a duty to pay steep taxes, but should 
feel honored for the opportunity to help create utopia right here in the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Or take another hot-button issue: welfare.  The debate is not 
about "ending welfare as we know it," as the president vowed to do during the 1992 campaign.  
In truth, we all want to end welfare as we know it: liberals, by increasing spending on a variety 
of programs that, after the Great Society's many failures, will finally (they hope) replace welfare 
with work;  conservatives, by spending less and weaning people off their dependence on 
"compassionate" government.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On foreign policy,  the budget debate casts into stark relief 
serious differences over America's role in the world. It's probably true, as liberals claim, that they 
do not view America as the world's policeman.  In reality it's worse: They view America as an 
international welfare agency whose social workers (read: soldiers) can and should criss-cross the 
globe doing good deeds like keeping peace and building nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	None of this is said to disparage liberals as people.  With 
the best intentions they have guided -- or misguided -- our national policies for the better part of 
the 20th century.  But now liberalism is choking on its own political success.  It's overarching 
goal -- a vast federal government mobilized to redress all social ills -- has been achieved, but at 
the cost of almost $80,000 in public debt for every family in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite its continuing failure at the polls, liberalism refuses 
to go quietly.  In the current budget battle,  liberals have ruthlessly employed the only weapons 
remaining in their arsenal: fear and distortion.  For example, the proposed Republican balanced 
budget calls for a 7 percent annual increase in Medicare spending; liberals portray this as a 
"cruel" cut.  GOP efforts to return power and responsibility to the states are portrayed as a secret 
scheme to kill school lunches or hurt the poor.  And plans to rein in the spiraling costs of 
Medicare, which is heading for bankruptcy as sure as this is 1996, is depicted as an attempt to 
deny health-care benefits to the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is that kind of misrepresentation that betrays the fatigue 
liberalism is feeling these days.  It has no new ideas to offer, no agenda other than preserving the 
status quo.  For this reason the current budget battle may very well be one of the last debates in 
which 1960s-style liberalism even has a voice.
<p>

Richard Weaver's seminal book "Ideas Have Consequences" could be our theme today, despite the fact that it was published almost 50 years ago. The remarkable growth of the Internet proves again the power of ideas to reshape how Americans communicate with each other, and the world. <p>
The Heritage Foundation's World Wide Web site was created to spread the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense, the same ideas which caused a political revolution in the 1994 elections. As Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich declared just after the election: "Heritage is, without question, the most far-reaching conservative
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally across the planet." 
<p>
As a leader in both the political and communications revolutions taking place today, The Heritage Foundation will continue to demonstrate the power of our ideas well into the 21st century.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."
<p>
<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.

<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.  
<p>

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>
<center>  
<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>

<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government

<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.


<P>
Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.
<P>
A year in foster care costs taxpayers $17,500 per child. Last year,
California spent $635 million on foster and group home care.
<P>
More than half of all foster children were abused or neglected
by their biological parents.
<P>
Fifteen percent of all children in America are black,but 40 percent
of the children in foster care are black.
<P>
More than 600,000 kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute
care - up from 434,000 in 1982.
<P>
After Massachusetts launched an aggressive pro-adoption campaign, foster
child adoptions increased by 47 percent.

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<b><a name="Tragic Irony">A TRAGIC IRONY</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>  
<center>
<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<title>Intro. to CD Ranking Book -- Heritage</title>

<p>
As members of Congress consider legislative proposals that will lead us into the next century, it is important that we understand the demographic composition of the districts they represent. This book does just that. We have used 1990 Long Form Census information, and ranked the Congressional Districts in numerous key categories, including the total amount of public assistance districts get, the total amount of farm income, the number of people who have a mortgage, just to name a few. In all we have 97 different categories to look at.<p>The layout of these reports is straightforward. <p>



<pre>
              People Over 65 -- Percent
       Congressional District Average:	12.5%

		State	CD	%	Deviation

	1.	FL	22	31.1%	5.49
	2.	FL	13	30.9%	5.44
	3.	FL	19	28.1%	4.62
	4.	FL	10	26.2%	4.03
	5.	FL	05	25.7%	3.88
	6.	FL	14	25.6%	3.87
	7.	FL	16	23.9%	3.36
	8.	FL	09	21.7%	2.70
	9.	AZ	03	19.7%	2.13

</pre>





<ul><li>The ranking is simply where the Congressional District is in relation to the other 434 and the District of Columbia.<p><li>The CD identifies each district with the two letter state abbreviation, and the Congressional District number within the state. 
<p>
<li>The # or % is the actual information. For example, the % of Asians in a district.
<p>
<li>The deviation is a little more complex. This is to show how far from the average a particular district is. It answers the question of whether the district is just slightly different from the national average, or significantly different. It also allows you to see the difference between two districts more clearly as well. 
<p>
<li>For more information on the U.S. Census Bureau, visit their web page, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>

</ul><p>
We hope this book will give readers a better understanding of all the Congressional Districts and what issues members might be concerned about.

</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>C. S. Lewis is perhaps the most widely known and read Christian
intellectual of the 20th century. His various works continue to sell more
than a millioin copies each year. He is best known for his theological and
fictional writings, but Lewis also was an articulate defender of representative
democracy, limited government, property rights, and the moral principles
upon which free societies are based. As Americans today seek to apply their
religion beliefs in the public arena in a constructive manner, there is
much they might be able to learn from Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, the purpose of Discovery Institute's project about Lewis and
politics is to use Lewis's writings to help American's better understand
the connections between faith and public life. The project includes public
conferences, books, scholarly colloquium, and published writings by Discovery
Fellows.</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <TITLE>Review of Darwin's Black Box</TITLE>

<H3>A Review of Michael Behe's <I>Darwin's Black Box</I><BR>
(The Free Press, 1996, 307 pages, $25)<BR>
<I>By Nancy Pearcy</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM">&quot;When light strikes the retina, a photon is absorbed by a
molecule<BR>
called cis-retinal, which causes it to change to trans-retinal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Such scientific jargon was unfamiliar terrain for a Washington, D.C., think<BR>
tank, and the audience grew hushed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The change in retinal forces a corresponding change in the protein<BR>
rhodopsin, which allows it to interact with another protein called<BR>
transducin.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Glances shot around the room, as members of the audience furtively sought
out<BR>
others who were equally mystified.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transducin dissociates from a small molecule called GDP and binds<BR>
to a different molecule called GTP, and this complex binds to a<BR>
protein called phosphodiesterase. . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For several minutes the polysyllabic mysteries piled up, until finally<BR>
embarrassed laughter broke out. But <A HREF="behe.html">Michael Behe</A>
had made his point: Speaking<BR>
to a group of educated non scientists, he had walked them through the complex<BR>
molecular interactions required for vision in way they will never forget.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's book <I>Darwin's Black Box</I> does the same thing for readers, painting
a<BR>
vivid picture of the cell's complexity. But his purpose is not simply to
give a<BR>
charming exposition of popular science, it is to challenge the Darwinist<BR>
hegemony in biology. Behe's thesis is that life depends on a host of molecular<BR>
systems that are irreducibly complex, a phrase he coins to mean that such<BR>
systems consist of several interlocking parts that must be in place before
they<BR>
can function. And since Darwinian processes kick in only _after_ there is<BR>
minimal function, the origin of an irreducibly complex system is out of
reach of<BR>
standard Darwinian explanations.<BR>
<BR>
As an analogy, Behe invokes the humble mousetrap: You can not start with
a<BR>
wooden platform and catch a few mice, add a spring and catch a few more
mice,<BR>
add a hammer, and so on, with gradual improvement of function. To function
at<BR>
all, a mousetrap requires a minimum number of interacting parts assembled
from<BR>
the outset. By the same token, an irreducibly complex organic system like<BR>
vision must come together all at once. It cannot appear gradually, piece
by<BR>
piece.<BR>
<BR>
But the heart of Darwinism is precisely such a gradualist scenario. Darwin<BR>
obligingly offered a way to falsify his own theory, writing: &quot;If it
could be<BR>
demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have
been<BR>
formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely<BR>
break down.&quot; Behe's point is that the cell is chock full of molecular
systems<BR>
that could not possibly have formed by successive, slight modifications.
Ergo,<BR>
Darwinism has broken down.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair to Darwin, he proposed his theory when scientists knew next to<BR>
nothing about biochemistry. Living things were &quot;black boxes,&quot;
their inside<BR>
workings a mystery. The cell itself was thought to be nothing more than
a blob<BR>
of jelly like protoplasm. It was easy to draw large scale scenarios about
fins<BR>
gradually turning into legs, or legs into wings, since no one had a clue
how<BR>
limbs and organs work from the inside. As Behe writes, it's as though someone<BR>
asked how a stereo system is made and we answered, &quot;by plugging a set
of<BR>
speakers into an amplifier and adding a CD player, radio receiver, and tape<BR>
deck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Today that kind of answer won't cut it, Behe insists. The &quot;black box&quot;
of the<BR>
cell has been opened and biologists are intimately familiar with its inside<BR>
workings--its nuts and bolts. Any successful explanation of the origin of<BR>
living things must deal with molecular systems.<BR>
<BR>
Consider the origin of vision, a problem Darwin said made him shudder. Richard<BR>
Dawkins, a contemporary Darwinist, brushes it off as no problem whatsoever:
We<BR>
merely begin with a light sensitive spot, Dawkins writes, move to a group
of<BR>
cells cupped to focus light better, and continue through a graded series
of<BR>
infinitesimal improvements to a true lens.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence is quite persuasive on the surface. But what about _under_
the<BR>
surface? To function, Behe argues, even Dawkins's initial light sensitive
spot<BR>
requires a cascade of factors, starting with cis-retinal and rhodopsin.
About<BR>
these complex molecular systems Dawkins is silent. As for those cupped cells,<BR>
dozens of proteins are involved in controlling shape and structure. About
these<BR>
complex proteins Dawkins says nary a word. It's the old strategy of telling
us<BR>
that stereos are made by plugging in speakers and a CD player.<BR>
<BR>
What we really want to know is whether Darwinism can explain how the speakers<BR>
and CD players themselves were assembled. Behe argues that it cannot, and<BR>
offers two types of arguments. On one hand, Behe has combed the scientific<BR>
literature and announces that there are virtually no professional papers<BR>
proposing detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of complex molecular<BR>
structures. Explanations simply do not exist.<BR>
<BR>
And the reason they are non-existent, Behe says, delivering his second punch,
is<BR>
that a Darwinian explanation of an irreducibly complex system is logically<BR>
impossible. At the heart of the book are five chapters that drive the point<BR>
home by describing different types of irreducible complexity. Some systems<BR>
consist of interdependent parts that must be assembled all at once, like
a<BR>
mousetrap. An example is the hair-like cilium, which functions like an oar
and<BR>
requires the interplay of more than 200 different proteins. Other systems
are<BR>
sequential, like a Rube Goldberg machine. An example is the blood-clotting<BR>
mechanism, in which numerous steps are exquisitely timed by a series of<BR>
catalysts to ensure that blood clots at the site of a wound and at no other<BR>
place or time. Still other systems depend on delicate recognition signals.<BR>
Certain molecules in the cell act as transport vessels that must recognize
the<BR>
right &quot;pick-up&quot; and &quot;drop-off&quot; zones, as well as the
right materials to carry.<BR>
<BR>
These examples are described in lively prose, sprinkled with vivid<BR>
illustrations. Any reader who follows Behe's descriptions will find it<BR>
difficult not to agree that the complexity of these molecular systems is
indeed<BR>
irreducible--that they could not arise by any step-by-step, Darwinian process.<BR>
<BR>
What alternative does Behe offer? Intelligent design theory. Structures
that<BR>
consist of interacting, co-adapted parts, he argues, are evidence of a<BR>
purposeful, intelligent agent. At this point, many readers may balk, objecting<BR>
that science is not equipped to deal with anything outside nature. To which<BR>
Behe replies: Catch up with the late-twentieth century. It was sixty years
ago<BR>
that the Big Bang theory was proposed, and cosmologists had to confront
the idea<BR>
of an ultimate origin of the universe--no matter how philosophically &quot;repugnant&quot;<BR>
(Eddington's word) they found that idea because of its implication of a
personal<BR>
creator. Now it is biology's turn to recognize that its data may likewise
have<BR>
discomfiting implications.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe is careful to limit his own discussion to the data itself. Thus
he<BR>
denies that from design we can infer the existence of the Christian God.
All we<BR>
can say is that a natural object exhibits the characteristics of intelligent<BR>
manufacture. In Behe's words, &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have<BR>
a candidate for the role of designer.&quot; We might select a candidate
based on<BR>
philosophical or theological grounds but not on scientific grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's tight focus on scientific data means he treats historical and<BR>
philosophical issues only gingerly. Except for brief (though illuminating)<BR>
discussions of Paley and Socrates, we hear little about the history of the<BR>
concept of design. Apart from a quotation from St. George Mivart, we learn
next<BR>
to nothing about the history of the Darwinian controversy. No mention is
made<BR>
of Georges Cuvier, who in the nineteenth century developed a similar notion
of<BR>
irreducible complexity (calling it &quot;the correlation of parts&quot;).
Nor is any<BR>
acknowledgement made of contemporary proponents of design theory, such as<BR>
Michael Denton (_Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_) or Thaxton, Bradley, and
Olsen<BR>
(_The Mystery of Life's Origin_).<BR>
<BR>
This narrow lens may be frustrating to some readers, but adopting it was<BR>
probably good strategy. Behe is an associate professor of biochemistry at<BR>
Lehigh University, and he stays squarely within his own field of expertise.
He<BR>
crafts one basic argument, and crafts it well.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, a few points may leave readers puzzled. Is Behe acreationist?
He<BR>
explicitly eschews the term. Though a Roman Catholic, he accepted Darwinism
for<BR>
many years without sensing any contradiction with his faith, and still accepts<BR>
common descent. The conclusion of design is drawn from the data itself,
he<BR>
insists, and &quot;not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs.&quot; It
is significant<BR>
that his book came out from a major New York publisher, not a religious<BR>
publishing house.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe may protest a bit too much. He rejects the label creationist only
by<BR>
narrowly restricting the term to those who accept a young earth and flood<BR>
geology--disqualifying a host of people who describe themselves as creationists<BR>
but do not hold to those geological theories. Similarly, Behe accepts common<BR>
descent only by giving _that_ term a highly atypical definition. His idea
is<BR>
that an original one-celled organism contained the information for all<BR>
subsequent biological development, which advanced through multiple, coordinated<BR>
changes in sudden, large leaps (akin to Goldschmidt's &quot;hopeful monster&quot;
theory<BR>
except that the monsters appear not by luck but through the unfolding of
an<BR>
implicit design).<BR>
<BR>
It might have been better if Behe had simply said, Sure, I accept creation,
and<BR>
it's time to stretch that category to acknowledge that creationists come
in many<BR>
stripes. Be that as it may, Behe's book is a powerful contribution to the<BR>
literature on the Darwin controversy. The black box has been opened.<BR>
Biologists had better get ready to face the implications of what they find<BR>
there.

<FONT SIZE=2>Biological origins can be one of the most captivating subjects
in the curriculum. As a biology teacher, you have probably already seen
how the topic excites your students. The allure of dinosaurs, trilobites,
fossilized plants, and ancient human remains is virtually irresistable to
many students. Indeed, many prominent scientists owe their interest in science
to an early exposure to this topic.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The subject of origins, however, is not only captivating. It's
also controversial. Because it touches on questions of enduring significance,
this topic has long been a focal point for vigorous debate &shyp;&shyp;legal
and political, as well as intellectual. Teachers often find themselves walking
a tightrope, trying to teach good science, while avoiding the censure of
parents or administrators.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To complicate things, the cultural conflict has been compounded
by controversies within the scientific community itself. Since the 1970s,
for example, scientific criticisms of the long&shyp;dominant neo&shyp;Darwinian
theory of evolution (which combines classical Darwinism with Mendelian genetics),
have surfaced with increasing regularity.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
fact, the situation is such that paleontologist Niles Eldredge was driven
to remark:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually
marks periods of healthy growth in science, then evolutionary biology is
flourishing today as it seldom has in the past. For biologists are collectively
less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a
scant decade ago.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, many scientists have advocated fundamental revisions
of orthodox evolutionary theory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, the standard models explaining chemical evolution&shyp;&shyp;the
origin of the first living cell&shyp;&shyp;have taken severe scientific
criticism. These criticisms have sparked calls for a radically different
approach to explaining the origin of life on earth.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Though many defenders of the orthodox theories remain, some
observers now describe these theories as having entered paradigm breakdown&shyp;&shyp;a
state where a once&shyp;dominant theory can no longer explain many important
data. Science historians Earthy and Collingwood, for example, have described
neo&shyp;Darwinism as a paradigm that's lost its capacity to solve important
scientific problems. They note that both defenders and critics find it hard
to agree even about what data are relevant to deciding scientific disagreements.
Putting it more bluntly, in 1980 Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould
pronounced the &quot;neo&shyp;Darwinian synthesis&quot; to be &quot;effectively
dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach
biological origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists
disagree about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for
not knowing which ones to teach. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>An Opportunity<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Controversy is not all bad, however. For it gives teachers
the opportunity to engage their students at a deeper level. Instead of filling
young minds with discrete facts and vocabulary lists, teachers can show
their students the rough&shyp;and&shyp;tumble of genuine scientific debate.
In this way, students begin to understand how science really works. When
they see scientists of equal stature disagreeing over the interpretation
of the same data, the students learn something about the human dimension
of science. They also learn about the distinction between fact and inference&shyp;&shyp;and
how background assumptions influence scientific judgement.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity that
the publisher offers this supplementary text, <I>Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins</I>. The purpose of this text is
to expose your students to the captivating and the controversial in the
origins debate &shyp;&shyp; to take them beyond the pat scenarios offered
in most basal texts and encourage them to grapple with ideas in a scientific
manner.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>does this in two ways. First,
if offers a clear, cogent discussion of the latest data relevant to biological
origins. In the process, it rectifies many serious errors found in several
basal biology texts.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, <I>Pandas</I> offers a different interpretation of
current biological evidence. As opposed to most textbooks, which present
the more&shyp;or&shyp;less orthodox neo-Darwinian accounts of how life originated
and diversified, <I>Pandas</I> also presents a clear alternative, which
the authors call &quot;intelligent design.&quot; Throughout, the text evaluates
how well these different views can accommodate anomalous data within their
respective interpretive frameworks. <I>Pandas</I> also makes the task of
organizing your lessons and researching the scientific issues much easier.
Pandas provides the scientific information you need, and provides it in
a way that coordinates well with your basal text.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the spirit of good, honest science, <I>Pandas</I> makes
no bones about being a text with a point of view. Because it was intended
to be a supplemental text, the authors saw no value in simply rehashing
the orthodox accounts covered by basal textbooks. Rather, its presentation
of a non&shyp;Darwinian perspective, in addition to the standard view, is
intended to stimulate discussion and encourage students to evaluate the
explanatory power of different theories &shyp;&shyp; which, after all, is
what science is all about.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By using this text in conjunction with your standard basal
text, you will help your students learn to grapple with multiple competing
hypotheses &shyp;&shyp; and to maintain an open but critical posture toward
scientific knowledge. As students learn to grapple with competing views,
and become active participants in the clash of ideas, you may be surprised
at the level of motivation and achievement displayed by your students.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Status of Evolution as a Fact</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the great value of presenting opposing viewpoints,
the popular debate over origins has fostered several misconceptions about
evolution, design, and science itself. To get the most benefit from this
supplement, teachers should understand these misconceptions and be prepared
to face them in an open and fair&shyp;minded manner when they arise.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>One misconception concerns the status of evolution as a fact.
In the origins debate, it is common to hear the assertion that evolution
is not merely a theory, but an indisputable fact. Educators who take this
view argue that it is futile and misleading to present non&shyp;Darwinian
views as serious alternatives to Darwinian evolution.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The factual status of evolution, however, depends critically
on what the word &quot;evolution&quot; means. Yale biologist Keith Stewart
Thomson points out that scientists have used the term in at least three
different ways.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first meaning he identifies is &quot;change over time.&quot;
In this sense, to say that evolution has taken place is to say that change
has occurred and that things are different now than they were in the past.
The fossil evidence, for example, reveals different organisms from one geological
period to the next.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the word is used in this sense, it is hard to disagree
that &quot;evolution&quot; is a fact. The authors of this volume certainly
have no dispute with that notion. <I>Pandas </I>clearly teaches that life
has a history and that the kinds of organisms present on earth have changed
over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second meaning that Thomson identifies is descent with
modification &shyp;&shyp; the idea that all organisms are &quot;related
by common ancestry.&quot; Evolution in this sense is a theory about the
history of life. In Darwin's view, that history can best be depicted as
a single branching tree &shyp;&shyp; a geneaological tree &shyp;&shyp; in
which life diversifies over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Many people assert that evolution in this second sense is a
fact, just as gravity is a fact. But the two situations are hardly analogous.
The fact of gravity can be verified simply by dropping a pencil &shyp;&shyp;
an experiment anyone can perform. The &quot;fact&quot; of common anscestry,
however, is on an entirely different level. We can no more &quot;see&quot;
evolution in the fossil record than paleontologists of Darwin's day could
&quot;see&quot; creation events. The best we can do is infer what might
have happened by piecing together circumstantial evidence from many different
fields.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin, for example, sought to establish common descent by
examining evidence from several different areas: paleontology, biogeography,
comparative anatomy, and embryology. Others have relied, in addition, on
evidence from genetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The problem with this kind of historical detective work, however,
is that it seldom produces a conclusion that forecloses other alternatives.
As philosopher of biology Elliot Sober points out, there may be any number
of plausible explanations&shyp;&shyp;or &quot;past histories&quot;&shyp;&shyp;that
can account for the same evidence. Sober's observation recalls the insightful
warning of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Circumstantial evidence
is a very tricky thing,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may seem to point very
straight to one thing, but if you shift your point of view a little, you
may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something different.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To use another analogy, consider the picture in Figure X. What
do you see? A tired old woman or an attractive young lady? Depending on
what you're looking for, you can probably see either one. The drawing hasn't
changed. The only thing that's different is the way you look at it.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The point is, unless we can eliminate plausible competing explanations,
it's presumptuous to call descent with modification a fact. As most people
understand the term, a fact &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">is supposed
to be distinguished from transient theories as something definite, permanent,
and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
By this definition, descent with modification simply doesn't warrant the
status of a fact. Far from compelling a single conclusion, the evidence
may legitimately be interpreted different ways, leading to several possible
conclusions. None of those conclusions warrant the status of a &quot;fact.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>As zoologist Thomas Kemp warns:<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[A]ll attempts to understand the diversity of organisms rely
upon empirically untestable assumptions either about evolution or about
natural patterns. There is nothing wrong with making assumptions or seeking
to justify them of course. It is the very stuff of science. What is unforgivable
is to forget that they are assumptions and behave as if they were known
certainties when they are no such things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, calling descent with modification a fact only closes
off debate and blurs the distinction between fact and inference. That, in
turn, makes us particularly vulnerable to the illusion that we know more
than we really do. In the preface to his best selling volume, <I>The Discoverers</I>,
historian Daniel Boorstin tells the reader:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The obstacles to discovery&shyp;&shyp;the illusions of knowledge&shyp;&shyp;are
also part of our story. Only against the forgotten backdrop of the received
common sense and myths of their time can we begin to sense the courage,
the rashness, the heroic and imaginative thrusts of the great discoverers.
They had to battle against the current &quot;facts&quot; and dogmas of the
learned.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is precisely why a book that questions the Darwinian notion
of common descent is so necessary. By presenting a reasonable alternative
to evolution in this second sense, <I>Pandas</I> helps students learn to
work with multiple perspectives, to distinguish those perspectives from
facts, and to guard themselves against the illusion of knowledge.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The final meaning of evolution that Thomson identifies concerns
the mechanism of biological change &shyp;&shyp; the particular explanation
of how evolution in the first two senses occurred. Here the term &quot;evolution&quot;
refers to random variation and natural selection. In Thomson's words:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although many biologists act as though [the mechanism] were
the whole meaning of evolution, it obviously is not. The first and second
meanings could be explained by several different theories, and both had
a serious intellectual history before 1859, while the third meaning is currently
confined to a particular explanatory hypothesis, Darwinism.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Evolution in this third sense asserts that the cause or mechanism
of biological change is purposeless, non&shyp;intelligent, and completely
naturalistic. Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins defended this view in his
best selling book, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I>. Like Darwin himself, Dawkins
acknowledges that biological organisms appear to exhibit remarkable design.
Yet both men claim that this appearance is an illusion, produced entirely
by random variation and natural selection. Blind nature mimics intelligent
design.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; thesis is often touted as
a fact, but it is not. For one thing, Darwinists have never demonstrated
empirically that natural processes can create the complex structures that
characterize living organisms. Like common descent, the blind watchmaker
thesis is based on indirect evidence. It accounts for hypothetical transformations
by extrapolating small observed changes over immense periods of time. Thus,
the blind watchmaker thesis is not a fact, but an inference. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, the blind watchmaker thesis &shyp;&shyp; at least
in its neo&shyp;Darwinian form &shyp;&shyp; may not even be a warranted
inference. As we mentioned at the beginning of this essay, neo&shyp;Darwinism
has come under increasing attack from scientists and philosophers alike.
Scientists have increasingly questioned the ability of mutation and natural
selection to generate new organs, limbs, or body plans. A host of other
problems have led biologists Mae-Wan Ho and Peter Saunders to say:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until only a few years ago, the 'synthetic' or 'neo&shyp;Darwinist'
theory of evolution stood virtually unchallenged as the basis of our understanding
of the organic world....</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the picture is entirely different. More and
more workers are showing signs of dissatisfaction with the synthetic theory.
Some are attacking its philosophical foundations....Others have deliberately
set out to work in just those areas in which neo&shyp;Darwinism is least
comfortable, like the problem of gaps in the fossil record or the mechanisms
of non&shyp;Mendelian inheritance....Perhaps most significantly of all,
there is now appearing a stream of articles and books defending the synthetic
theory. It is not so long ago that hardly anyone thought this was necessary.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> gives students a much&shyp;needed
opportunity to explore the evidence and arguments that have caused some
scientists to doubt contemporary Darwinism. It examines evidence from such
fields as biochemistry, genetics and paleontology--evidence that casts doubt
on the sufficiency of purposeless processes to explain the appearance of
new biological forms.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going a step further, <I>Pandas</I> helps students understand
the positive case for intelligent design. Following a growing number of
scientists and philosophers, the authors argue that life not only <I>appears</I>
to have been intelligently designed, but that it actually was. Drawing on
recent developments in molecular biology, the authors show that even simple
organisms bear all the earmarks of designed systems.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The authors will also discuss what theorists have learned by
applying mathematics and information science to biology. Those insights
suggest that there are ways to distinguish natural systems from intelligently
designed ones--and have led some scientists to conclude that the &quot;coded
genetic information&quot; (or sequence specificity) of DNA, proteins, and
the like, reflects the activity of a pre-existent intelligence. While that
conclusion is still controversial, a growing minority of scientists see
it as a plausible alternative to the blind watchmaker thesis. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By presenting the case for intelligent design the authors demonstrate
that there are alternatives to the blind watchmaker thesis--and that evolution
as a purposeless process is neither an indisputable fact, nor the only inference
supported by biological data.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, then, only in the most trivial sense&shyp;&shyp;change
over time&shyp;&shyp;can evolution be considered a fact. Far from being
a legitimate reason for avoiding alternative views, the alleged &quot;fact
of evolution&quot; underscores precisely why a book like <I>Pandas </I>is
so necessary. If students are to achieve true scientific literacy, they
must learn to distinguish fact from supposition. A curriculum that blurs
this distinction serves neither the students nor society.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Science and the Laws of Nature</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second misconception revolves around the question of what
makes a concept or explanation &quot;scientific.&quot; In particular, some
scientists and philosophers assert that the concept of intelligent design
is inherently non-scientific. According to this view, science must explain
things by using natural laws&shyp;&shyp;not by invoking an the special action
of an intelligent agent. Thus, we no longer explain the orbit of a planet
by saying that an angel pushes it through the heavens. We explain it with
Newton's law of universal gravitation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the same way, design is ruled out&shyp;of&shyp;court because
it invokes an intelligent agent, rather than natural laws. Philosopher of
science Michael Ruse, for example, has said:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Science attempts to understand this empirical world. What is
the basis for this understanding? Surveying science and the history of science
today, one thing stands out: Science involves the search for order. More
specifically, science looks for unbroken, blind, natural regularities (<I>laws</I>).
Things in the world do not happen in just any old way. They follow set paths,
and science tries to capture this fact. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are serious problems with this view, however. One problem
is that it ignores areas of scientific investigation where intelligent design
is a necessary explanatory concept. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) is one example. At the time of this writing, radio telescopes are
scanning the heavens, looking for artificial radio signals that differ from
the random signals generated by natural objects in space. If we were to
limit science to the search for &quot;unbroken, blind, natural regularities
(laws)&quot; we would have to say that SETI is unscientific&shyp;&shyp;by
definition.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Archaeology would meet the same fate. Archaeologists routinely
distinguish manufactured objects (e.g. arrowheads, potsherds) from natural
ones (e.g. stones), even when the differences between them are very subtle.
These manufactured objects then become important clues in reconstructing
past ways of life. But if we arbitrarily assert that science explains solely
by reference to natural laws, if archaeologists are prohibited from invoking
an intelligent manufacturer, the whole archaeological enterprise comes to
a grinding halt.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second problem with limiting science to blind, natural regularities
is that it confuses <I>laws </I>with <I>explanations</I>&shyp;&shyp;an error
that philosopher of science William Alston calls &quot;a 'category mistake'
of the most flagrant sort.&quot; Laws and explanations are often two different
things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Scientific explanations often invoke not only laws, but causal
events and actions. For example, consider the field of modern cosmology.
Most cosmologists explain the features of our universe not only by reference
to the laws of physics, but by reference to a single event: the Big Bang.
The Big Bang, for example, helps explain why galaxies throughout the universe
seem to be receding from each other. It also explains the presence of low
level radiation that seems to permeate space. These phenomena cannot be
explained solely by reference to physical laws, or natural regularities.
Rather, the critical explanatory feature is a one-time event that established
the conditions responsible for the phenomena that we now witness.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Taking this idea a bit farther, sometimes it seems that scientific
laws are hardly relevant to our explanations at all &shyp;&shyp; such as
when we try to explain why things turned out one way rather than another.
For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation may tell us why the
earth has a Newtonian orbit rather than a non&shyp;Newtonian one. But it
doesn't explain why the earth follows it's present orbit, instead of some
other orbit that's equally compatible with Newton's law. That kind of explanation
requires something else &shyp;&shyp; namely, information about how the earth
attained its present position and velocity.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar example can be drawn from the field of historical
geology. If a historical geologist wanted to explain the unusual height
of the Himalayas, invoking natural laws would be of little use. Natural
laws alone cannot tell us why the Himalayas are higher than, say, the Rocky
Mountains. That would require discovering antecedent factors that were present
in building the Himilayas, but not in other mountain&shyp;building episodes.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, scientific explanation not only involves laws, but may
also involve past causal events. If scientists could never invoke past events
and causes, they could not explain many important phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why is this important? Because ignoring the role of causal
events in scientific explanation has created a false dichotomy between agency
&shyp;&shyp; or intelligent design &shyp;&shyp; and the laws of nature.
The fact that scientific explanations may invoke laws doesn't mean that
agency is somehow ruled out. Rather, intelligent agents can alter causal
events and other contributing factors. Although intervention may alter the
course of subsequent events &shyp;&shyp; sometimes in novel and unexpected
ways &shyp;&shyp; it does not violate natural laws.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, the actions of intelligent agents are themselves causal
events. Therefore, citing the action of agents may be necessary to explain
many present phenomena. Imagine trying to explain Mt. Rushmore without reference
to sculptors. Law-like explanations involving only natural processes would
completely miss this critical explanatory factor. That is why archaeologists,
forensic scientists and historians often find it impossible to avoid postulating
intelligent agency.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The notion that science explains solely by reference to natural
law suffers from yet a third problem. In addition to confusing laws with
explanations, it assumes a cookie&shyp;cutter view of science, in which
all disciplines ask similar questions and use the same &quot;scientific
method.&quot; This belies the rich diversity of methods that scientists
use to understand the natural world.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Several philosophers, for instance, have argued that a clear
distinction exists between the &quot;inductive sciences&quot; and the &quot;historical
sciences.&quot; These two broad categories ask different kinds of questions,
and use different kinds of methods. The inductive (or nomological) sciences,
on the one hand, ask questions about how the natural world operates. Hence,
a virologist may try to discover how a particular enzyme helps a virus infect
its host. Or a crystalographer may try to determine the effects of weightlessness
on crystal growth. In each case, scientists seek to uncover the regularities
that characterize natural phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The historical sciences, on the other hand, ask different kinds
of questions. Rather than trying to understand how the natural world operates,
the historical sciences seek to understand how things came to be. One example,
of course, would be the historical geologist who was seeking to explain
the unusual elevation of the Himalayas. Another would be an evolutionary
biologist seeking to explain the origin of giraffes. Still another would
be the archaeologist seeking to reconstruct an ancient culture. Note that
in each case, the goal is not to find new laws or regularities, but to reconstruct
past conditions and events.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of this distinction to our present discussion
is that although postulating intelligent intervention is completely inappropriate
in the inductive sciences, the same is not true in the historical sciences.
In the inductive sciences, the whole point is to discover how the natural
world normally operates on it's own, i.e., <I>in the absence of intelligent
intervention</I>. Postulating an intelligent agent would thus be contrary
to the stated goal of research.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the historical sciences, however, the goal is to reconstruct
past events and conditions. Thus, there is no need to impose such restrictions.
Quite the reverse. As we have seen, the explanation of certain artifacts
or features may require reference to intelligence. Intelligent agents may
have left traces of their activity in the natural world. The historical
scientist need not turn a blind eye to them.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hence, when investigating the origin of the living world, it
is perfectly acceptable to hypothesize an intelligent designer if the evidence
warrants.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Observability</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third misunderstanding concerns the scientific status of
unobservable objects and events. Some philosophers and scientists claim
that intelligent design is not scientific because it invokes an unobservable
intelligent designer. To be scientific, they claim, a concept or idea must
be testable. Because an intelligent designer is unobservable it is not testable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence not scientific.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is by no means clear, however, that something is untestable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence unscientific&shyp;&shyp;simply because it is unobservable. If this
were the case, many accepted theories and concepts would have to be declared
unscientific as well. Chemist J.C. Walton observes:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The postulation of...external intervention [into nature by
a designer] indoubtedly restores order, harmony and simplification to the
data of physics and biology. [Yet] at present there is no unambiguous evidence...for
the existence of the external entity, but this should not be regarded as
a drawback. Many key scientific postulates such as atomic theory, kinetic
theory of the applicability of wave functions to describing molecular properties
were, and still are, equally conjectural. Their acceptance depended, and
still depends, on the comparison of their predictions with observables.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also falling in this category are almost all theories in the
historical sciences&shyp;&shyp;theories that postulate conditions and events
that occured in the unobservable past. The Big Bang is one such theory.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another, ironically, is Neo&shyp;Darwinism. Although Neo&shyp;Darwinism
explains many observable features of the living world, it postulates unobservable
objects and events. For example, the mutational events that allegedly produced
reptiles, birds, mammals, and even humans, have never been observed &shyp;&shyp;
nor will they ever be observed. Similarly, the transitional life forms that
occupy the branching&shyp;points on Darwin's tree of life are also unobservable.
Transitional forms exist now only as theoretical entities that make possible
a coherent Darwinian account of how present&shyp;day species originated.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unobservable character of Darwinism becomes especially
plain when proponents try to reconcile the fossil evidence with their theory.
As paleontologists now admit, the fossil evidence looks a good deal less
&quot;Darwinian&quot; than they had previously acknowledged. Indeed, as
Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould points out, the two outstanding features
of the fossil record are &quot;sudden appearance&quot; and &quot;stasis.&quot;
At any given location, species tend to appear &quot;suddenly,&quot; fully
formed, and exhibit no directional change during their stay on earth.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The standard neo&shyp;Darwinian explanation for these features
is the imperfection of the fossil record: Because fossilization occurs only
under special circumstances, fossils give us only a rough sketch of evolutionary
history. More recently, some have proposed that evolutionary change occurs
rapidly, and in small, isolated populations of organisms. Both explanations,
however, invoke unobserved circumstances (how can one observe a non&shyp;fossilization
event that happened 100 million years ago?) to explain unobserved fossil
organisms.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin himself realized that much of the evidence for his theory
was indirect. Indeed, he spent long hours defending his practice of inferring
the unobservable from the observable.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend
to adduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that
I believe that this view in the main is correct because so many phenomena
can be thus grouped and explained.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If we accepted the principle that unobservable entities are
inadmissable in science, we would have to reject not only Darwin's theory,
but his entire approach to scientific investigation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To be fair, some opponents of intelligent design would argue
that the real problem is not unobervability, but flexibility. The concept
of an intelligent designer is simply too much of a &quot;wild card&quot;:
it can explain anything. Put another way, the concept of an intelligent
designer cannot be falsified.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the contrary, however, intelligent design is not so flexible
that it cannot be falsified. The concept of intelligent design entails a
strong prediction that is readily falsifiable. In particular, the concept
of intelligent design predicts that complex information, like that encoded
in a functioning genome, never arises from purely chemical or physical antecedents.
Experience will show that only intelligent agency gives rise to functional
information. All that is necessary to falsify the hypothesis of intelligent
design is to show confirmed instances of purely physical or chemical antecedents
producing such information.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, intelligent design is not unique in its flexibility.
We have already seen how Darwinists handle the problem of the fossil record
(i.e. in the way they account for unobserved fossil forms by invoking unobserved
geological processes). Indeed, the history of science shows that scientists
have often offered <I>ad hoc</I> explanations to save a cherished theory.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the historical sciences, where
investigators must draw conclusions from incomplete or sketchy evidence.
If flexibility is an issue, therefore, it should be an issue for every scientific
theory, not just intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religion and Intelligent Design</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A final misconception you may confront is that intelligent
design is simply sectarian religion. According to this view, intelligent
design is merely fundamentalism with a new twist &shyp;&shyp; and teaching
it in public schools violates the separation of church and state.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This view is wide of the mark. The idea that life had an intelligent
source is hardly unique to Christian fundamentalism. Advocates of design
have included not only Christians and other religious theists, but pantheists,
Greek and Enlightenment philosophers, and now include many modern scientists
who describe themselves as religiously agnostic. Moreover, the concept of
design implies absolutely nothing about beliefs normally associated with
Christian fundamentalism: such as a young earth, a global flood, or even
the existence of the Christian God. All it implies is that life had an intelligent
source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, sectarianism is more a matter of form than content.
It is marked by a certain narrowness and exclusivity that entertains no
debate and tolerates no opposing viewpoints. Given the broad appeal of intelligent
design (even Richard Dawkins, a staunch Darwinist and author of <I>The Blind
Watchmaker</I>, acknowledges &quot;the appearance of design&quot; in the
living world), it is perhaps more accurate to conclude that the real sectarians
are those who villify design as &quot;fundamentalist religion.&quot; Such
name&shyp;calling is merely another way to avoid debate and keep the real
issues off the intellectual field of play.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even if the design hypothesis were religious, however, criticizing
it on that basis begs the question of whether it's scientifically warranted.
In science, the origin of an idea is supposed to be irrelevant to its validity.
What matters is not the source, but the whether the idea is logically consistent
and empirically supportable. If it is, what justification is there for excluding
it from the classroom?</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its landmark ruling on the Louisiana Balanced Treatment
Act, the United States Supreme Court did not try to shield the classroom
from dissenting viewpoints. Indeed, it affirmed that teachers already had
the flexibility to teach non&shyp;evolutionary views and present scientific
evidence bearing on the question of origins:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Act does not grant teachers a flexibility that they did
not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the
presentation of theories besides evolution, about the origin of life. Indeed,
the Court of Appeals found that no law prohibited Louisiana public schoolteachers
from teaching any scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Neither did the Supreme Court choose to limit that flexibility:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[T]eaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins
of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular
intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is not only consistent with good science, it's consistent
with the highest ideals of a democratic society. As John Scopes, who was
tried 1920s for teaching evolution, said at his own trial, &quot;Education,
you know, means broadening, advancing, and if you limit a teacher to only
one side of anything the whole country will eventually have only one thought,
be one individual. I believe in teaching every aspect of every problem or
theory.&quot;<BR>

When we finally find some evolutionary change, however slight it may seem,
the &quot;typostrophic&quot; sort of affair the <I>Phacops rana</I> lineage
seems to show in the Midwest poses a choice between two unappetizing alternatives:
either you stick to conventional theory despite the rather poor fit of the
fossils, or you focus on the empirics and say that saltation looks like
a reasonable model of the evolutionary process--in which case you must embrace
a set of rather dubious biological propositions. Paleontologists are rather

partly a revolution in what people considered to be &quot;scientific.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>For these purposes, it has little to do with greed. Or wanting to buy
too much at the mall to boost your self-esteem. <BR>
<BR>
Materialism is the modern day philosophy that holds that matter is all there
is. It's the philosophy that says &quot;If you can't touch it, smell it,
taste it or explain it through the hard sciences, it doesn't exist.&quot;
Men are merely complex machines and not spiritual beings. <BR>
<BR>
And it's approved by most intellectuals around the world. <BR>
<BR>
One other thing: we're out to topple it. <BR>

<H4>Darwinism is the belief that we evolved not only from the apes, but
that we started from nothing other than purposeless mass. As late Harvard
evolutionary biologist George Gaylord Simpson said, &quot;<I>Man is the
result of a</I> <I>purposeless and natural process that did not have him
in mind. He was not planned</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin is to Materialism like Karl Marx is to Communism. Like Adam
Smith is to Capitalism. This is not to say that Darwin himself is responsible
for the full course of Darwinism since his death. But he opened the door.

<H4>Materialism is a powerful philosophy of life today because it sets the
boundaries for what is right and wrong in society. It explains the &quot;rules&quot;
that govern our civilization. It goes to the very intellectual roots of
society, the very foundation that our social and cultural institutions are
built upon. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if materialism is right &shyp; as most intellectuals propose &shyp;
then &quot;God&quot; is merely a figment of our imagination. Therefore,
God didn't create man; man created God. Doestoyevsky once said that &quot;
<I>if God is dead</I> <I>then all things are lawful</I>.&quot; Might makes
right. The State is the ultimate enforcer of rules. <BR>
<BR>
Let's look at how materialism has infected the legal system, welfare and
popular culture.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><BR>
Materialism teaches us that God is dead. It follows that divine revelation
cannot be the basis of human law. <BR>
<BR>
Human law can only be based on upon the current opinion of the people who
have the power to make and interpret laws. In our society, that power rests
in the hands of an elite class of judges, lawmakers and other experts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot; We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&quot;
quickly loses much validity if our &quot;Creator&quot; does not exist. Result:
a culture of irresponsibility and victimhood. <BR>
<BR>
The present culture took decades to develop. Look at a 1930s text in criminal
law that upholds the materialist foundation: <BR>
<BR>
<I>&quot;Man is no more responsible for becoming willful and committing
a crime than a flower for becoming red and fragrant. In both instances,
the end products are predetermined by nature.&quot; <BR>

<H4>Dating back to the 1960s, those who conceived the war on poverty believed
that poverty could be eradicated because they believed its root causes were
material: poverty, educational deprivation, crime, etc Thirty five years
later, we realize that throwing material resources at the problem has made
it worse, not better. <BR>
<BR>
By ignoring the moral and spiritual dimensions of poverty, we have ignored
the real problems of poverty: family breakdown, illegitimacy and government-fostered
dependency. </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>If morals are relative and nothing is absolute, anything goes. It requires
no deep intellectual digging to see how materialism has assaulted popular
culture. <BR>
<BR>
Popular culture seldom portrays religion favorably yet often with disdain.
Those characters who seem to hold traditional or conservative values will
surely be mocked, seen as &quot;square&quot; and even &quot;oppressors&quot;
of some sort of unalienable right bestowed upon humankind from Hollywood.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Much depends on how you define &quot;evolution.&quot; Some people think
evolution describes how things change over a period of time ( i.e. a finch's
beak length, a moth's color etc). Others think that slow and <BR>
gradual change to one organism can be translated directly into how life
itself was created. <BR>
<BR>
At a very basic level, we think evolution might explain the survival of
the fittest, not the <I>arrival </I>of the fittest and that it can explain
some form of development, but not original development. <BR>

The idea behind the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF)</CENTER>
</H1>
The idea for creating a legal analog to the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html">Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF)</A> occured to Peter Harter while writing
an essay criticising Senator Exon's &quot;Communications Decency Act of
1995&quot; (S.314). <A HREF="harter.html">Click here</A> to see this unpublished
essay.) The following is a brief idea outline for the Internet Law Task
Force , written prior to the launch of the task force in October of 1995
at Discovery Institute's Internet Law Symposium 95. This idea was the genesis
for what has become The Forum for Internet Law and Policy with further revisions
coming from mebers and interested parties across the Interent community
and around the world.<BR>

<P><B>The Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) Project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea for an Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) came from a solution proposed
by Peter F. Harter in an essay he wrote and submitted to The New York Times
for publication in their Op-Ed page. Although this submission is, as of
the date of this presentation, still under consideration and despite the
youth of this ILTF idea (less than two weeks old), it has gained support.
The idea for an ILTF was unveiled publicly on 12 April 1995 at the Internet
Society Summit, in San Diego, California. In addition to the initial sponsors
listed in this memorandum, additional supporters have agreed to work together
as part of an ad hoc &quot;ILTF formation and steering committee&quot;:
Prof. Hank Perritt of the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy;
David Johnson, Chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bob Collett and
Ron Plesser of the Commercial Internet Xchange; Jeffrey Ritter, Executive
Director of OARNet and founder of the Electronic Commerce, Law, and Information
Policy Strategies project; Jerry Berman, Executive Director, The Center
for Democracy and Technology; Lance Rose, Esq.; Jan Constantine, VP and
General Counsel, Delphi Internet Services; David Maher, Esq., and Co-Chair
of the Internet Task Force of the International Trademarks Association;
Prof. David Post. In addition, David Johnson has agreed to co-chair the
steering committee with Peter Harter in order to determine what shape ILTF
should take.

Q. Can interoperable designs negate need for outside regulation? <BR>
<BR>
A. Yes, if an ILTF exists. <BR>
<BR>
____________________________________________________________________ <BR>
<BR>
<B>I. Introduction.</B> <BR>
<BR>
An Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) can be the legal policy and norms forum
for the Internet. An ILTF must be a large, open, international body consisting
of practicing lawyers, in-house corporate counsel, legislative professionals,
academics, business professionals, technologists, researches, network operators,
publishers, system administrators, and other interested parties. All involved
should be concerned with the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global
electronic community that balances terrestrially bound and geographically
defined interests with the decentralized and transborder nature of internetworked
computer communications that is the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The ILTF shall be an analog to the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force)
so that constituents of the Internet and its related industries and communities
can remain self-regulating by determining and promoting legal policies that
reduce risk and liability. If effective, an ILTF can reduce the need for
governmental entities to regulate the use and operation of the Internet.
Like the IETF, the ILTF can succeed by attracting the active and regular
participation of professionals from around the world and by reaching out
to as many cultures and nations in the world as possible in order to avert
conflicts of law and to attain comity amongst disparate electronic communities
and various computer networks rooted in different and distant countries.
<BR>
<BR>
An ILTF can be begun formally and publicly at the Internet Society's upcoming
Summit in San Diego, California, on April 12, during and or after the legal
panel presentation. At that time an acting advisory committee may be formed
so that an ILTF can be properly constructed. This memorandum is only a sketch
-- a starting point from which the idea for an ILTF can be launched. <BR>
<BR>
The National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) wishes to work with other
organizations and individuals to promote and further develop self-regulation
and accountability within the collection of users and operators of the Internet.
The Internet Society has agreed to help launch this idea with NPTN and has
offered to form a secretariat and to seek funding. Ameritech Advanced Data
Services and America Online have agreed to be the initial sponsors of the
concept of an ILTF. Other organizations are invited to become initial sponsors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II. Why Create an ILTF?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Due to increasing scrutiny by mass media and by legislators and government
officials in the U.S., Canada, and other countries, as well as in states,
provinces, and other terrestrially based jurisdictions, the Internet is
at risk of being Balkanized by inconsistent and ill-thought attempts at
rule making and control. Recently, a Bill introduced in the U.S. Senate
known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S.314) and now likely to
gain passage in that legislative chamber, threatens to impose liability
on those least able to control indecent communications; it ignores the fact
that users are held accountable for their actions already in varying formats
by their system administrators and or network service providers. Users self-regulate
their electronic communities and work with network operators to sustain
the vitality of their networks. S.314 is also embarrassing: It blindly attempts
to regulate a medium that is inherently international in design and destiny.
For S.314 to try and control communications on the Internet assumes that
the U.S. can impose its values on others from around the world and strips
citizens of electronic communities of their right by contract to define
what the acceptable uses of their communities shall be. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are possible alternatives to S.314. On April 7, 1995,
Senator Leahy introduced the &quot;Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill&quot; (S. 714). Leahy's
Bill directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), to conduct a study to address technical means for empowering users
to control information they receive over interactive communications systems
such as the Internet, commercial online services, independent BBSs, and
future interactive media. <BR>
<BR>
S.314, however, is not the first nor will be the last attempt at regulating
the Internet; however, it drove one Internet lawyer to start pamphleteering
about the issue. In an essay submitted on 29 March 1995 to The New York
Times for publication in their Op-Ed page, Peter Harter of NPTN reasoned
that if standardization and regulation of the Internet is to occur, it should
come from the bottom-up -- just as the technical standards for the Internet
evolve via the IETF. After some online consultation with Tony Rutkowski
of the Internet Society, it was agreed that an ILTF was an idea worth considering
-- a concept whose time has come. <BR>
<BR>
It is the desire of the creator and founding members of an ILTF that it
form not to impose rules as a super-legislature. Instead, an ILTF must endeavor
to educate elected officials and governmental entities so that they may
better understand the technical and cultural nature and diversity of the
networks that make up the Internet. ILTF must serve as a coordinator to
and communicator between existing Internet law and policy efforts; ILTF
must not aim to duplicate or displace such existing efforts. In doing so
the ILTF can look to the IETF for structure and lessons as the IETF has
had over thirty productive and substantive working meetings since 1986.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III. Modeling the ILTF After the IETF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>A. Meetings.</B> The ILTF should meet at least twice a year initially
and perhaps more frequently (i.e., the IETF meets three times a year). It
is proposed that the first public meeting of the ILTF be held, perhaps,
on or near Bastille Day, and outside the U.S., so that the inaugural meeting
may be inspired by the relevant symbolism and history as well as the international
component that is integral to building an effective ILTF. By holding regular
meetings the ILTF shall provide an open arena for working groups (see below)
to coordinate development of legal and policy findings and, recommendations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B. Mission.</B> The ILTF mission includes but is not limited to: <BR>
<BR>
* Identifying and proposing solutions and or alternatives to legislative
initiatives arising from any terrestrially based and or electronic governing
body; <BR>
<BR>
* Specifying the development of alternative forms of rules that electronic
communities can opt to use in order to diffuse any conflicts; <BR>
<BR>
* Facilitating the exchange of information between professionals in different
countries so that there may be a better informed and more active legal and
policy community; <BR>
<BR>
* Providing a forum for the exchange of relevant information within the
Internet community between system administrators, users, network operators,
publishers, intellectual property holders, government agencies, businesses,
academics, educators, and concerned citizens; and, <BR>
<BR>
* Publishing online tools and information resources to be used by citizens
of electronic communities, governmental agencies, businesses, and other
interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C. Working Groups.</B> Leading up to the first meeting and in the time
between meetings thereafter, the actual substantive work of the ILTF shall
be done by working groups. Like the working groups that sustain the efforts
of the IETF, workings groups for the ILTF shall be organized by topic into
several areas. The following areas are suggested and additions and modifications
are requested: <BR>
<BR>
Suggested Area Suggested Contact Person(s) <BR>
<BR>
1. Content a. Copyright Lance Rose, Esq. b. Warning Labels David Johnson,
EFF; Howard Shapiro, Playboy Enterprises <BR>
<BR>

14. Technical Matters IETF Representatives <BR>
<BR>
[Nota Bene: The foregoing list of lawyers is subject to change and non-exhaustive.
No contact has been made to any of the above with the exception of Ellen
Kirsh and George Clapp. It is recommended that the acting advisory committee
ask individuals to join the initial slate of working groups.] <BR>
<BR>
Each working group area would have a director that would be a member of
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG) (see below). Under each director
would be a collection of one or more working groups breaking out to tear
through various issues that make up the larger area. As necessary, each
working group within an area could have its own director who would be a
part of an area directorate which reports its findings to the area director
which are then to be communicated to the ILSG. While a very large pyramid
of people can be created here, it is important to have small and focused
efforts in order to cut through issues and not get bogged down in larger
and somewhat alienating meetings. Rough consensus and not strict voting
shall be the proactive rule. <BR>
<BR>
Also, it would be wise to have liaisons set up between ILTF and the IETF,
W3, the U.N. Internet Project, and other organizations and programs as deemed
necessary so that the ILTF may maintain open and interactive communications
links between other organizations to which the ILTF should work in concert
with either intermittently and or regularly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>D. Management.</B> Management of the ILTF shall be handled by individuals
who volunteer to lead a particular topic area and or who represent a particular
region or interest group at large. Together, these volunteers shall form
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG). The acting advisory committee to
be formed at the Internet Society Summit in San Diego after the unveiling
of the ILTF concept shall act as the ILSG until a proper ILSG can be formed.
This is likely to occur after the first successful meeting of the ILTF.
The operational management of the ILTF may be handled by the ILSG under
the auspices of NPTN and the Internet Society. In addition, the ILTF may
decide, at future time, to create an Internet Law Arbitration Board (ILAB)
for the specific purpose of having an independent body to adjudicate disputes
in the working processes of the ILTF. <BR>
<BR>
<B>IV. Policy Development </B>&amp; <B>Dissemination.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Neither the ILTF, nor any voluntary, international body can or should have
the right to somehow claim that its de facto rules can be imposed upon other
bodies. However, the ILTF can draft and adopt high quality policies and
then let the marketplace decide if they want to join in and support them
as norms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>V. International Outreach &amp; Character of ILTF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
To be successful the ILTF must focus on attracting active international
participants and directions. Those volunteers involved in the early stages
of the effort to build an ILTF must not be limited in their thinking; while
the &quot;likely suspects&quot; shall be integral, new and unusual members
must be sought out and asked to adopt the concept of an ILTF as their own
and become an ILTF evangelist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VI. Path Forward.</B> <BR>
<BR>
First, a broad and internationally diverse endorsement of ILTF must be sought.
Second, a plan of action must be drawn up for those leading ILTF. Third,
input must be solicited and integrated. Fourth, a revised memorandum or
formal proposal green paper should be produced and released for comment
and revision. Fifth, plans for a first meeting should b made. Sixth, a formal
white paper should be produced and disseminated for consideration and if
possible adoption and endorsement. Seventh, the processes involved in the
Sixth stage should occur at a live meeting held some time in the summer
of 1995, perhaps around the time of Bastille Day. Eighth, a host for a second
meeting should be sought out in advance and be announced at the conclusion
of the first meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. Appendix A: &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The following is an unordered, unpreferential, unrevised listing of those
individuals and organizations that should be contacted and asked to be involved
in the creation of an ILTF. They are in no particular order. This list is
not exhaustive. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law Task Force Organizing to Achieve Consensus on Internet
Legal Issues</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>OCTOBER 31, 1995</B> -- <B>Seattle,WA</B> -- The first international
conference on the law of the Internet served as the platform for the announcement
of an effort to establish the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) to facilitate
the progressive development of law and public policy in the global information
age.<BR>
<BR>
The ILTF will provide an international forum for issues related to the use
and growth of the Internet including: evolution of the business practices
and legal instruments to assure the validity and acceptance of digital transactions;
property rights; privacy; and the elimination of legal barriers to Internet
commerce and electronic transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to accelerate at the global level the development of solutions
borne of consensus,&quot; stated Peter Harter, former executive director
and general counsel of <A HREF="http://www.nptn.org/">National Public Telecomputing
Network</A>, and now public policy counsel of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications</A>, who first advanced the ILTF concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Developing standards and practices to protect digital information
and promote the integrity of electronic markets is essential for extending
the Internet to developing countries and nations in transition,&quot; said
Jeffrey Ritter, a legal advisor to the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">United
Nations</A> on the automation of international trade. &quot;Quite simply,
without an established framework, the Internet faces a confusing, and potentially
disabling, assortment of national laws seeking to govern a global environment,&quot;
Ritter added.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle-based <A HREF="index.html">Discovery Institute</A>, will provide
organizatinal support for the ILTF. The organizing committee will be jointly
chaired by Albert Gidari, a partner with the Seattle-based law firm Perkins
Coie and senior fellow of Discover Institute; Harter; and Ritter, program
director for <A HREF="/Eclips/eclips.html">ECLIPS</A>, a research program
of the Ohio Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to mature the ILTF into an operating non-governmental
organization as soon as practicable, but ILTF must be a collaborative operation.
We look forward to seeking and obtaining broad-based support for moving
ahead.&quot; the organizers said.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet Law Symposium '95, hosted by the Discovery Institute, was the
first conference devoted to analyzing the legal aspects of an evolving global
space. Bruce Chapman, President of Discovery Institute, announced that most
of those attending added their names to the global listserv--an electronic
discussion group--established for continuing dialogue on the structure and
direction of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
The concept has attracted widespread interest from industry, which has grown
increasingly concerned by the growing efforts of governments to attempt
to regulate the Internet. According to Harter, since the early dialogue
on the need for an ILTF, over one hundred interested organizations and professionals
from four continents have urged establishment of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For commerce to succeed in cyberspace greater certainty, not inconsistent
regulatory regimes around the globe, is needed,&quot; Gidari said.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>According to a recent study, people who are now in their
twenties believe they are more likely to see a UFO than Social Security
benefits. <BR>
<BR>
</B>THE FACTS ARE CLEAR. When the baby boomers hit retirement, Social Security
will run out of money, and the timetable for reform requires meaningful
change by the end of the century. Based on over three years of extensive
research and consultation with S.S.I. experts and authorities, <I>Restoring
Hope in America</I> presents a bold plan to save <B>your</B> Social Security
benefits and guarantee financial security in <B>your</B> retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Social Secuirty reform must happen within the next five years or America
will face economic disaster in the next century, and unacceptable social
consequences in the pitting of young against old. Resotring Hope In America
is a call to action -- action based on accountability and reason in establishing
a new &quot;Declaration of Financial Independence&quot; for the modern workforce
and instituting guidelines for pension management by the government.<BR>

traders. But many people are left out of the boom, including bank tellers
and telephone operators, middle managers and others whose jobs are being
rendered obsolete by new technologies, corporate down-sizing and international
competition. They can get jobs in this economy, but often not at levels
commensurate with their backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
In the short term, there is no easy answer to such people's underemployment,
but there is one field that offers substantial opportunity for workers of
all kinds, from the minimally skilled to the highly educated. That field
is tourism. Paying an average of 10 percent more than other employment,
today's tourism industry is a source of good jobs as well as more jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Tourism matters to Washington State because the region is an increasingly
popular visitor destination, but also because Seattle is headquarters for
such top travel companies as Westin Hotels, Alaska Airlines, Holland America
cruise lines and, of course, Boeing. Unfortunately, state and local governments
have put relatively little emphasis on exploiting this strength. At 15.2
percent, Seattle has the second highest hotel room tax in the country--surpassed
only by Columbus, Ohio, hardly a tourist magnet. Yet, Washington State ranks
47th among states investing such dollars in development of the tourism industry.<BR>
<BR>
What's our problem? Perhaps we still think of tourism as a frill, or as
an industry with a real future only in sunnier climes. Or we fret that the
tourists who visit from Japan or Scandinavia will go home, quit their jobs
and move in on us. Neither statistics nor experience back up those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
How underrated is tourism? Well, how many of us realize that it is now the
number one industry in the world? The stunning fact is that tourism business
generated $3.4 trillion last year, even surpassing conventional manufacturing
categories like steel or autos. Seattle and King County stand to gain greatly
from this global development; our own annual tourism business has grown
from $900 million to $2.7 billion in the past decade. The number of foreign
visitors--480,000 last year--also has doubled in that period, not even counting
two million Canadians. But we can do much better.<BR>
<BR>
The foreign market, indeed, is one of the most promising. This is especially
so in Asia, where the middle class is doubling its massive size in this
generation--from 200 million to 400 million in India, for example. Worldwide,
women are becoming a bigger share of travelers now--already up to 33 percent.
Another trend: leisure visitors, rather than business travelers, will soon
account for 80 percent of air travelers.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have found that these new international tourists are very cost
conscious--just at the point in history when the United States finally has
become more affordable. Moreover, 75 percent of current foreign visitors
to the US have been here before, so there is fresh curiosity about destinations
other than standard gateway cities like New York and Los Angeles. Seattle,
for instance: close to Asia, up-to-date, well-priced, and also friendly
and safe. <BR>
<BR>
Juergen Bartels, the new chairman and CEO of Westin Hotels, a company that
began in Seattle 65 years ago and today is a leading hotelier in 80 locations
around the world, was asked recently why Westin decided to remain here.
His response was that &quot;Seattle is not in the middle of the country,
but it is in the middle of the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lest that sound like mere boosterism, the German-born Bartels is quick to
point out that the &quot;world&quot; Westin has identified as leading the
travel boom is the Pacific Rim, and especially Asia. Seattle is a good location
from which to launch an ambitious hotel expansion scheme like Westin's,
which aims to open 60 new hotels in the next five years, an average of one
a month.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle's position in international travel is improved further by our new
status as U.S. home to APEC (the Asian Pacific Economic Council) and the
prestige of the Henry M. Jackson School at the University of Washington,
whose international program is particularly strong in Asian studies. The
Port of Seattle's new International Conference Center that opens next summer
and the coming expansion of the Washington State Convention Center will
help establish Seattle as an especially well-endowed meeting location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing so far, however, is a well-orchestrated, high priority effort
to build on this area's international tourism potential. We cannot and should
not count on the federal government to lead; its whole tourism budget is
only about the size of Luxembourg's, and nothing like, say, Canada's. In
Olympia, Governor Lowry and a couple of state legislators intend next month
to propose a doubling of the state budget for tourism--but that still will
amount to only $4.6 million, far less than the programs of neighboring states,
let alone, British Columbia. It's time for state and local governments to
see the full scope of the opportunity and to collaborate in meeting it.<BR>
<BR>
The best strategy is, first, to increase spending in tourism development
by tapping into the huge tax revenue provided by the tourist industry itself
in the form of the hotel tax. Judicious use of that source should not alarm
the general taxpayer and will return its investment manifold. When a modest
public and private promotional budget was deployed by the Seattle area in
Great Britain recently, it resulted in a doubling of British tourist visits
here. <BR>
<BR>
Pooling existing funds of government and private sector alike, as in the
British promotional case, should be the second emphasis of an international
tourism strategy. A common promotional campaign will go much farther than
many divergent ones. Indeed, we should solidify the tentative efforts now
underway to link the overseas tourism programs of the Northwest states with
the more advanced foreign visitors campaign of British Columbia and build
up the international appeal of the whole Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, isn't it time that we stopped looking the gift horse of tourism
in the mouth?

    <TITLE>Curbin America's Appetite for Lawsuits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>From the Friday, December 8, 1995, <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</I></B>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
It's time to curb America's appetite for lawsuits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="katz.html">[Read Roberta Katz's remarks on reform of the adversarial
legal system]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>A woman at McDonald's spills hot coffee in her lap and a jury awards
her $2.7 million. Another jury awards a man $4 million from BMW because
he wasn't told that his new car had received a minor paint touch-up before
he bought it. Yet another man is awarded $12.3 million, most of it in &quot;punitive&quot;
damages,&quot; because he fractured his neck on a Slip 'n Slide lawn toy
whose wrapper, he charges, did not warn him adequately that adults could
get hurt playing with such a thing. (It just shows that we must keep toys
out of the hands of grown ups.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Winning the lawsuit sweepstakes in today's America is a lot easier than
winning the lottery, and while news of enormous legal awards arouse amazement
and anger in most of us, it evidently incites a drooling appetite to sue
in the rest. No wonder we now have 14 million lawsuits a year, one for every
17 Americans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The western district of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than all of Japan.
California as a whole is definitely a Golden State for trial lawyers; 99
of 100 auto accidents, including fender benders, result in lawsuits. Overall,
Americans' chance of being in a suit is now three times that of Canadians.
And it isn't just big businesses that gets hit, but also mom and pop stores,
charitable groups and local governments--anyone, however remotely connected
to a problem, with &quot;deep pockets&quot; that can be invaded when the
real source of a grievance is poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When lawsuits hit the jackpot, who do you think benefits almost as much
as the alleged victim (who gets an average of 43 percent of awards)? That's
right, the lawyers get about 33 percent, and the rest goes to administrative
and other costs. Top corporate lawyers in America do very well in life,
but the top trial lawyers eclipse them, some raking in $15-$90 million a
year, a recent review inForbes magazine shows. Especially well-rewarded
are those who figure out how to get a parade of new clients to sue the same
company for the same problem over and over and to get &quot;punitive damages&quot;
each time in order to &quot;send a message&quot;--a message that sometimes
reads &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; Juries are not allowed to learn about this
tactic, or they would rebel more often.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And who, in addition to the manufacturer or store owner, pays? Right again:
you do--in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices and lowered
stock values in your personal or pension portfolio. Even though some of
the most outrageous suits are later reduced by judges, the whole litigious
system in this country, according to a study by the management consulting
firm of Tillinghast/ Perrin Towers, is freighting our economy with a burden
$140 billion annually. That is money that otherwise could create new jobs,
raise pay and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the trial attorneys and the professional &quot;consumer advocates&quot;
they so often support race to their word processors to protest my bias (or
maybe start a class action suit!) let it readily be acknowledged that businesses
and ordinary citizens do sometimes commit terrible blunders that harm others,
and that &quot;tort law&quot; is an entirely proper corrective. Lawsuits
often have forced negligent companies, doctors and other entities and individuals
to accept proper financial responsibilities and to improve safety standards.
Even the &quot;contingency fee&quot; arrangement that assures a plaintiff
that he will not pay the lawyer unless he wins the case can be defended
on the basis that it allows poor people access to justice in a system that
favors wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, however, is that the system has slowly gone nearly out of control
and has become counterproductive. Trial attorneys' jaundiced eyes and wily
ways may have motivated some otherwise indifferent firms to act more responsibly,
but at least as often the fear of legal action reaches a point where companies
are driven out of business by ruthless legal speculators. Doctors stop entering
certain fields that have become overly attractive to lawsuits. In some states,
people who might otherwise be good Samaritans when confronted by a person
in distress, instead refuse to help because of a wholly rational fear of
being sued. Another example of the chilling effect of over-litigation is
the growing trend among employers to avoid giving objective references for
former employee because they know that certain trial attorneys' latest speculative
field is &quot;wrongful termination&quot; (cases doubled between 1991 and
1994). The result is that many employers are wary of new hiring altogether.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognition of these consequences of over-litigation has finally created
a backlash. This year alone some 20 states have passed tort reforms. A study
by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows considerable stimulus
of economic growth in those states where tort reforms have been enacted,
and a drag on the economies of states where lawsuits hobble enterprise,
and that kind of study will fuel still more reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, trial attorneys are used to calling the shots in Washington,
D.C. , perhaps because they are generous campaign contributors, last year,
for example, donating $14 million. But they are conspicuously apprehensive
that Congress might pass serious tort reform legislation in this session;
indeed, in the next few weeks. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives,
led by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, passed a fairly broad bill, including
caps on punitive damages and much-needed malpractice limitations. But the
Senate, where floor-leader Slade Gorton of Washington feared that too narrow
a victory would invite a Presidential veto, came up with a much more limited
reform bill that mainly covers product liability. (Another bill to limit
frivolous class action suits by supposedly aggrieved stockholders disappointed
at the failure of managers to anticipate stock price fluctuations seems
to be coasting to a surprisingly easy victory and Presidential signature.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, while the trial attorney lobby believed that House-Senate differences
were too great to allow any bill to pass this year, the two houses' &quot;Conference
Committee&quot; suddenly appears close to a resolution. Reform-minded senators
now think that their present veto-proof majority might be willing to accept
certain obviously reasonable aspects of the House bill--for example, a financial
limit on civil actions that don't involve physical injury or suffering,
and a limit on actions taken against non-profit organizations and local
governments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If Congress passes any tort reform bill this session, the cause of major
reform will not be drained of energy, as some reformers fear, but reinvigorated.
A public appetite for suing one another took us down the present path, and
an appetite for restoration of a more civil society can now be stimulated
through the steady introduction of successive and successful steps toward
the thorough overhaul our system really needs. Legal utopianism paradoxically
diminishes the very justice it claims to seek. We have another, better tradition,
and that is common sense. It has a much better record of achieving justice
in this all too imperfect world.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Happy Conservative Pit-Bull Turns Ten <BR>
by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
Polls show that the public primarily blame Republicans in Congress, rather
than President Clinton, for the recent (and future?) government shutdown.
Those who blame both sides equally think that the battle is merely &quot;political&quot;
in the worst sense. At the state level, Referendum 48, the property rights
initiative, was soundly defeated earlier this month by a margin of 60-40.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is the conservative revolution running out of steam? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No--not to hear John Carlson tell it on his KVI radio afternoon talk show.
Indeed, the jovial Carlson, who infuriates liberals, is even more gleeful
than usual these days as he urges Seattle area listeners to deluge the President
with ball point pens to encourage him to sign a balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, there are good reasons for conservatives to smile. Though politically
at sea for years, they finally can smell dry land. History, their onetime
foe, seems to be on their side now. Significantly, while conservatives are
keeping their promises, the opposition is accepting their premises. The
issue in Washington, D.C., for example, no longer is whether to seek a balanced
budget, but how to achieve it, and how soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get the issues defined your way, it is possible to stop fighting
rear-guard actions and go for a clear cut victory. When you really reduce
spending growth to below the rate of inflation and commit in fact, not fancy,
to a balanced budget, you can expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates. In anticipation of that, markets already have rallied. If you go
on to reduce taxes on families and capital gains, economic expansion becomes
sturdier, and philanthropic giving grows. If you genuinely constrain government
over-regulation and decentralize government functions, personal liberty
is enlarged. Seeing that all this really is possible, the voters want more.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, conservatives may lose some day-to-day propaganda struggles, but the
long term &quot;fundamentals&quot; of their position (as economists might
say) are sound. In about two more elections they may emerge not only as
the normal governing majority in politics, but also the major force in intellectual
life--the status that liberals have occupied since the Depression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The liberals' ideas came out of academia, starting with the first self-conscious
&quot;political scientists&quot; at Princeton and Johns Hopkins at the turn
of the century. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created
the huge federal civil service, and it, too, generated ideas. The media,
which was mostly conservative or neutral until 40 years ago, swung to the
left in the 1950s, with a few notable exceptions, and gave liberalism an
aura of moral superiority and political inevitability. Even big business
was leery of wandering outside of the supposed liberal &quot;consensus.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of conservative renaissance, however, were planted during the
very heyday of the liberal intellectuals by a philosopher named Russell
Kirk and a small magazine edited by young Bill Buckley, <I>National Review</I>.
But it has prospered thanks largely to an institution created in the present
generation: the think tank. Some think tanks--or public policy institutes--are
liberal, but most are not, and as you look at the pages of national and
local magazines and newspapers, or listen to TV discussions and radio talk-shows,
you are bombarded by the news and views of &quot;fellows&quot; in &quot;institutes.&quot;
That's new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In national affairs, it happened first in Washington, D.C. with creation
of the American Enterprise Institute (eclectic conservative), the Heritage
Foundation (&quot;movement&quot; conservative, with a $28 million budget),
and Cato Institute (libertarian), among others. But then a second phase
occurred--explosively--at the state level, and, at last count, there are
now some 60 think tanks around the country specializing in local and regional
issues. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Portland, there is the Cascade Institute and in Olympia, the Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, led by former state legislator Bob Williams. But the
oldest public policy group in the Northwest is the Washington Institute,
founded by John Carlson, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am prejudiced, I admit it. I have enjoyed John's company ever since he
was a delightfully irreverent college student at the University of Washington,
assaulting the choleric dogmas of The UW Daily . He is still irreverent,
and whether you find that delightful or not probably depends on your politics.
He's also smart and constructive. By founding the Washington Institute in
1985 and helping it to survive this long, he has given state and local government
a whole new source of political ideas and initiative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John has now graduated to a perch as institute &quot;chairman&quot; so that
he can devote more of his time to harrying the left from his talk show,
a weekly column and regular appearances on two TV discussion programs. Stomping
around on the grapes of liberal wrath, he still lands hard on the toes of
antagonists, but his writing and wit have matured like a vintage Merlot.
Visiting dignitaries pay him court, and one of these days he is going to
wake up and find that he is part of the Establishment. But, happily, not
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, an energetic former insurance executive, Bill Baldwin, runs the
institute's show out of donated offices in a West Seattle building with
the biggest American flag you ever saw. From there issue papers decrying
state regulatory and budgetary excesses, calls for stronger defense of property
rights and a tough line on crime. A couple of years ago the institute helped
conceptualize the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; legislation that
now wins nods even from The White House. Institute arguments were used by
state legislators who rolled back Gov. Lowry's health care plan. At the
moment, high priority is attached to increasing privatization of many state
government functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of this policy agenda, Washington Institute also publishes
Counterpoint, a newsletter that assigns itself the role of watchdog on the
watchdogs of the media, usually biting at their heels, but also making &quot;good
dog&quot; awards. Overall, critiquing the press is not exactly a winning
strategy for assuring coverage of your other programs, but it does keep
many readers amused and gratified, and maybe it does some good in reminding
members of the Fourth Estate that they, too, are human. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For all of this, the state's watchdogs of the right are grinning as they
nip away. Every dog must have its day, and, after 10 years, the sun does
not seem at all ready to set on the Washington Institute. <BR>

    <TITLE>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday November 3, 1995 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism is Not Unique to Quebec </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by <BR>
Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>What do you follow in politics, economics or your heart? The moral discipline
of the market or the lure of memory? Your future as an individual or the
passions of your group? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Quebec was asked such questions this week, it split almost neatly in
two. And so might many of us. Indeed, what Canada faced, and will face,
is not dissimilar to what America faces and much of the world faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By a victory margin of only one percent, the decent, muddle-through confederation
of Canada--engaging affection not because of its pride, but because of its
humility--managed to hold on to just enough of the French-speaking community
to give it a reprieve from permanent division. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We now see, moreover, that what was averted may have been worse than even
the loss of a major province; namely, a complete breakup. When it seemed
that the &quot;sovereignist&quot; side might prevail in Quebec, large crowds
nationwide rallied 'round the Maple Leaf; and in that sense, Canada at last
found its patriotic voice. But at the same time, some commentators began
to re-investigate old arguments for an independent British Columbia, Alberta
or Ontario. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Gibson of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, whose <I>Thirty Million
Musketeers: One Canada for All Canadians</I> , has just been published,
warned that a &quot;majority-plus-one 'yes' vote&quot; in Quebec very quickly
might result in several nation-states emerging across the broad pink map
that now represents Canada. But Quebec, voting a majority-plus-one percent
&quot;no,&quot; did not secede, for the moment, though another attempt will
be made in a few years. In the long run, however, economics, the moral discipline
of the market and individualism--rather than ethnic nationalism--will prevail.
And, they should prevail. Je me souviens (&quot;I remember&quot;) is a bitter-sweet
ethnic sentiment, not a principle for just governance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the battered federalist victors in Monday's vote have another
chance to revise political Canada. One way to try to prevent dissolution
is devolution. Not just heavily subsidized Quebec, but also the relatively
well-off provinces of Ontario, B.C. and Alberta, want more power to make
policies on pensions, labor training and economic development. Driven by
the brutal demands of Canada's federal debt--roughly $400 billion U.S. dollars--and
huge provincial debts, too, the governing Liberal Party in Ottawa may well
agree. Otherwise, as Gordon Gibson notes, the twin to the danger of losing
Quebec will be losing Canada's sovereignty to foreign credit markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the way, as federal power is devolved to the provinces, the level
of federal funding will be cut. Taxes probably will not go up, however,
and eventually must come down, for political as well as economic reasons;
Canadians are punished by high taxation and are showing interest in the
supply-side economics of the relatively new Reform Party. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If cutting spending and devolution sound like an echo of the policies of
the Republican Congress elected last year in the United States, that is
because these trends are, in fact, widespread. Pruning back years of government
growth, privatizing and decentralizing are logical responses to increasing
global economic competition. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The frugality medicine is hard enough to swallow in the United States, but
Canada is likely to gag on it. But, one of the reasons for the strong separatist
vote in Quebec is the poor state of the Canadian economy, and the main reason
for the poor economy--high unemployment, high interest rates, sagging dollar--is
government's refusal until now to take the medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The moral discipline of the market does lead to economic--and social--health,
that is the good news. You can see the results in the recent improvements
in such far-flung countries as Chile, New Zealand, the Czech Republic and
Estonia. The government of President Meri of Estonia, who visited Seattle
this week, cut taxes and eliminated tariffs and reports a sustained six
percent growth rate, in contrast to dawdling, centralist Russia, next door.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estonians also have the second highest per capita Internet use in Eastern
Europe (after Finland). High technology, indeed, is another force for decentralization
and greater economic freedom world wide. The Internet is almost an emblem
of what is happening to communication and commerce today. It ignores national
borders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But does this free and open world, with its economy driven by high technology,
sound a bit frightening? If you feel that way, you have company in more
places than Quebec. In Eastern Europe, for example, the collapse of communism
caused even more fear than pain and often stimulated an escape to the seemingly
warm hearth of ethnic nationalism. Chechnya, Bosnia and the peaceful but
foolish secession of Slovakia from its Czech partner show the devastating
consequences of that illusion. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our own country, we only have to get over two generations' growth of
the welfare state, not totalitarian socialism. But the appeal of ethnic
nationalism is strong here, too, as witness the black separatist ambitions
(though now ambiguous) of Louis Farrakhan. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you are, if you are hurting and fearful, it is tempting to nourish
your resentments and to imagine that you are stronger in a group-- racial,
ethnic, religious, geographic, gender, or whatever. The group, you find,
derives its justification in grievances against some other group. If only
you can remember past wrongs to the group and elevate the group identity
to your all-purpose answer, you can forget the moral discipline of the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders and the classical liberal economists had a different
vision: of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The Canadians have
their own version of the same understanding. Because it respects all individuals
as equal before God and the law, this vision benefits society as a whole.
It tries, at least, to see you for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For people have souls as well as hearts, and souls do not go to heaven in
groups, but one by one.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>For Canada breaking up is hard <BR>
-- and wrong -- thing to do</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Canada is a country where something terrible is always just about to happen,
but never does. The terrible thing is usually the secession of Quebec. The
mere possibility of a province seceding reminds a citizen of the United
States of what stability was bequeathed to our country by the Civil War.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other respects, Canada's political scene is usually so calm that Americans
pay it no attention. We tend to see our northern neighbor as simply that
big happy vacation land that produces great comedians and Hollywood movie
locations that look more like American cities than our own do. &quot;Politics
in Canada&quot; sounds like the title of a boring book.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But hardly anything disturbs the political calm like breaking up one's country.
And in Canada that seems to be a constant and real threat. For nearly three
decades Canada, like Sisyphus, has been condemned to roll the rock of Quebec
up the hill of federalism, only to have it roll back down again, over and
over. Worse, federalist forces have to win every election held on on the
issue of separation, while secessionists need only win once. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably. In Canada, elections often settle even less than they do here,
especially since Canadians are masters of the art of Awkward Compromise
that leaves everybody somewhat satisfied, but also a little grumpy. If Quebeckers
next Monday vote for &quot;sovereignty&quot; and empowerment of provincial
leaders to negotiate a new relationship with the rest of Canada, it is still
unclear what that will mean in concrete terms. Prime Minister Jean Chretien
says it means separation, clear and simple. No more Canadian passports.
A division of the national debt, and no special favors. On the other side,
the Bloc Quebecois, led by Lucien Bouchard, argues that Quebec will be an
independent &quot;nation&quot; if the &quot;yes&quot; vote prevails, but
nationhood in this instance apparebtly is conceived as something between
the existence of a strong province and a truly foreign state. Both sides
claim the other is insincere and unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going into the final week of the campaign, the &quot;yes&quot; vote on sovereignty
was pulling ahead. If the final returns run along those lines, there will
be a political earthquake of long duration in Canada. Already, in dreadful
anticipation, the Canadian dollar and stock prices have been falling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best hope for federalism, acording to a former Liberal Party cabinet
minister, Gordon Gibson, who is now a fellow of the free-market Fraser Institute
in Vancouver, is &quot;ballot box chill.&quot; As seems to have happened
in 1980, Quebec voters may celebrate independence over the weekend, then
soberly vote their economic interests--which surely lie with federalism--the
next day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, Quebec sovereignty is a deep cultural aspiration for many of the
francophone citizens of la belle province, and to the extent that economic
motives operate beyond that aspiration, popular disatisfaction over the
currently stagnant economy seems to make &quot;change&quot; the ally of
separation rather than of continued federalism. Sadly, Quebec is no different
than the rest of Canada in its bad fiscal management in recent years. Government
deficits at both national and provincial levels are so high that America's
appear mild in comparison and elsewhere even the dominant Liberal Party
has been forced to economy measures, many Quebeckers have not got the word.
Though they are, on balance, subsidized by the federal government, they
think their economic difficulties come from unfair treatment at the hands
of &quot;TROC&quot;--the rest of Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That makes TROC as angry as reserved Canadians allow themselves to get.
Annoyance is especially strong in the West, and nobably across our border
in British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That raises the obvious question, how would a &quot;yes&quot; vote in Quebec
affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Americans, especially those living close to the border, the obvious
question is, how will this affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is complex. However annoyed English (or better, non-French) Canada
may be with Quebec, the prospect of disunion would be a real blow to national
morale. Worldwide, Canadian prestige would be hurt. Despite the high cost
of keeping Quebec in the style to which &quot;le Belle Province&quot; is
accustomed, the loss of Quebec and the literal division of the country,
would damage Canada economically. Even more than the US, Canada needs budgetary
belt-tightening combined with sound growth if it is to avoid economic decline.
Yet, as the breakup of the USSR has shown, it is difficult to reform oneself
economically while the whole map is being redrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Canada in not a basket case like some of the former Soviet states.
Unfortunately, Americans tend to think of Canada mainly as a place that
produces great comedians, shares our baseball games (where we fly their
flag upside down and get their national anthem wrong), and looks more &quot;American&quot;
in Hollywood movie productions than many locations in the United States.
It's our little brother that we alternately ignore or enjoy teasing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, in reality, Canada is a big, independent, powerful country. If it seems
less sometimes that is only because Canada is next door to, well, us. It
wins awards as the most &quot;livable&quot; country in the world. It is
democratic. In their quiet way, Canadians are passionate about freedom.
When times are tough, as when our diplomats were taken hostage by Iran,
or on any number of ocassions at the UN, when a confidential friend or honest
broker has been needed, Canada has taken on the job. In trouble spots around
the world or in a natural disaster, Canada is almost always at our side,
or there before us. Canada is our NATO ally. And our biggest trading partner.
Canada's well-being and its self-confidence matters--to us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, a vote for disunion may, once more, be avoided. Quebec's voters
may have their separatist victory party Saturday night and then sober up
the next day and again vote &quot;non.&quot; Alternatively, disunion for
a diminished Canada, if it happens could prove endurable, or even beneficial
for Canada. Like the Czech Republic without Slovakia or Slovenia without
the rest of Yugoslavia, a smaller Canada might actually prosper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, meanwhile, we in the Pacific Northwest have especially strong reasons
to be concerned about the Quebec vote. Our commercial and cultural ties
with British Columbia are growing stronger all the time. Regardless of the
Quebec vote, we have cause to persevere with our concept of &quot;Cascadia&quot;
as a cooperative region of US states--particularly Washington and Oregon--with
Western Canada--particularly B.C. We have great opportunities to promote
both sides of the border in this distinct and fortunate geographic region,
whether the collaboration is expressed in expanding tourism from overseas,
conducting ocassional joint trade missions, reducing border delays, improving
bi-national transportation, forming education partnerships among our universities,
boosting regional sports teams and arts activities, and just learning from
one another. Cross-border Cascadians have much in common, including a bright
future. Let us also make it plain that we have never wanted political union,
just friendship and cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The genuine crisis a Quebec separatist vote would cause Canada, and the
chronic frustration the issue will continue to cause in Canadian politics
even if the federalists prevail by a narrow margin, can evoke only one legitimate
response down here. Regret. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing we can do after Sunday's vote is to emphasize how much we
in the Northwest value the close ties we have with our provincial neighbors
in &quot;Cascadia,&quot; as well as with the rest of Canada.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What Laws Should Govern the Internet? </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><CENTER>Individuals, not governments, should shape Internet's future</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bruce Chapman </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The two traits that have always distinguished the American character are
a fierce insistence on personal liberty and &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;
Both live on brightly in the Internet, the winning future of communications
and commerce. Forget Al Gore's industrial era image of &quot;the information
superhighway,&quot; conjuring up visions of interactive televisions and
a big regulatory job for government. The concept isn't big enough or open
enough for what the Internet already is becoming. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet began as an obscure Defense Department communications project
a quarter of a century ago, but for the past twenty years it has been changing
in form and content. It is no longer a government network tying computer
users together, but a worldwide network of many networks, free and open
to all, and increasingly easy to access. There is no monopoly potential
to it, so government's excuse to regulate it is almost nil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More than 40 million people presently use the &quot;Net&quot;, some just
for electronic mail. However, 22 million of them also use it for research,
education, buying and selling, video-conferencing, publishing, or simply
seeking information in text and motion pictures from around the world. With
the number of &quot;domains&quot;--Net locations you can contact--growing
about seven thousand a month, and with numbers of users doubling annually,
the Internet is a whole new communications revolution. Further, its low
cost general offerings are greatly enriched by various for-profit services
and software products that, in turn, help America's economy to expand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But (good news for lawyers, alas) there are legal problems on the Net. If
the Internet it to continue to flourish, these problems must be met head
on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When businessmen, attorneys, techies, academics and government officials
meet in Seattle for the first International Internet Law Symposium later
this month, they will be responding to a sense that Internet service providers
and users need to find answers to certain legal issues before the government
does. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A government-run Internet is no more in the public interest than a monopoly-run
Internet. But neither is a lawless Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, this column belongs to the Seattle Post-Intelligencernow and,
per agreement, to me later. In a few days I'll put it on the Internet &quot;home
page&quot; of my think tank and make it available to readers all over the
world (I can dream, can't I?). But what if someone plagiarizes it? Or simply
reprints it and sells it commercially? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, if it were not a column, but,
say, a book--say, your book--you might care a lot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, copyright law has to apply somehow to the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so do other property rights, including the right to protect one's reputation.
Who, for example, owns e-mail within a company? What are standards of libel
in cyberspace? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or take the issue of gambling, which is now illegal in most states, with
certain exceptions. A huge battle is building over a proposal to provide
Bingo and other gambling on the Internet, organized through a Native American
company, Multimedia Games, Inc., in Oklahoma, and operated through outlets
on reservations nation-wide. How can gambling be controlled when state and
eveninternational borders mean nothing? Among other things, how can it be
taxed? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like most legal disputes, these involve both important principles and practical
trade-offs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pornography is another example. When both models and customers may be children--including
children receiving unsolicited filth through the Internet--the principle
of offended &quot;community standards&quot; normally would be invoked. But
what is the &quot;community&quot; in this case: Seattle? The world? The
&quot;community&quot; of Internet users? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the related problem of persons inventing false identities
and deploying the Internet to attract gullible minors to real life sexual
encounters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any added legal sanctions, of course, must be understood as complimenting,
not contradicting, other important values, such as privacy and free speech.
Fortunately, law enforcement is getting into the field in both a vigorous
and reasonable way. Which raises the question, do we need new laws in this
area, or just common sense extensions of the ones we have? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trend towards digitized cash is yet another story. Banking is heavily
regulated now and while many of us are intrigued by the trend toward commercial
transactions conducted over the Internet, unless people have good assurances
of security, such innovations won't succeed. Unfortunately, federal law
presently prevents U.S. businesses from encrypting their transactions internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case, transfers of money electronically, as ATM's have shown in a
modest way, do not have to be fail-safe. They just need to be as safe as
transactions that use cash or checks. In a few years, cash in your wallet
may be almost as rare as a silver dollar. Money will move internationally
the way it moves around town now. Ah, but when all that happens, what becomes
of the IRS? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of these questions are fascinating to discuss and deliberate. But first,
one major medium for discussing them, the Internet iteself, needs to be
better understood. At the moment, while the telecommunications bills before
Congress move in the direction of a freedom model, they still ignore the
Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ordinary people should shape the exciting future of the Internet. Government's
job is simply to be sure that the laws that keep normal commerce reliable
and free also protect the Internet. But, even that job is going to require
careful foresight. <BR>

<P>Ross Perot may have walked into a trap of his own devising. By deciding
to set up an official political party instead of merely running for President
as an independent candidate, Perot will be subject to all the legal difficulties
that beset the two major parties. It will be harder now for him to play
the reformist outsider. And the state versions of his new party are almost
sure to cause problems. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What will he have gained? Practically nothing. Organizing a new political
party in these times is like starting a typewriter company; you're investing
in a declining market. Political parties historically had four main roles:
control of nominations, financing candidates, filling patronage jobs and
creating a cohesive caucus in the Congress and state legislatures. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All but the last role have been reduced in the past thirty years, thanks
to one &quot;reform&quot; after another. Primary voters, not party regulars,
pick most nominees; candidates' organizations, not parties, raise most campaign
funds; and patronage--after a century of civil service reform--is down to
token numbers, and those few are hired by office-holders without much consultation
with their party. And the last role--forming legislative caucuses--is not
one that will benefit Perot's Independence Party, since it is unlikely to
elect many local candidates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we assume that Perot will be able to get his party legally recognized
in all 50 states, and that is a big assumption, there still are enormous
obstacles to operating the party successfully. Laws governing parties differ
widely from state to state. For example, the latitude for a party to give
financial support to particular candidates is far greater in a state like
Ohio than it is in a state like California. Separate legal teams, and legal
procedures, will be needed for each state. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With 50 new state Independence parties will come a certain amount of &quot;independence&quot;
for those parties internally. The publisher of the daily political Hotline
in Washington, D.C., Douglas Bailey, predicts that &quot;Once Perot creates
all these state parties, there is nothing to stop them from running local
candidates with their own ideas and their own personal baggage. Then Perot
loses control.&quot; New York's Independence Party, which suggested to Perot
that he use its name, already plans to slate up to a thousand candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot also may lose some of his self-styled reformer image. In the past,
he has wanted us to believe that the two major parties get into trouble
so often because their candidates are morally weak and lack his wonderous
&quot;common sense.&quot; Only Perot, standing above the fray, was pure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In reality, most election scandals are the result of some petty infraction
or wrong assumption about the nation's increasingly dense weave of campaign
laws. Never before, including the Progressive Era, have so many ethics laws
been put on the books. Even with relatively experienced personnel, the Republicans
and Democrats cannot help making the kind of petty bookkeeping and judgment
errors that, taken out of context and exaggerated by a hostile opponent
or the media, can be made to look serious and intentional. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot's United We Stand, America is legally a mere non-profit organization
and, for example, does not have to follow financial disclosure laws. But
Perot's new and official party will be held to the same strict standards
as the Republicans and Democrats. His organization will find the reporting
of contributions alone to be a tricky challenge. Then will come the scrutiny
by the media and political foes. Did anyone contribute more than the permitted
$1000 per person? Was any of the money from a source that someone, somewhere
deems disreputable? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, when something goes wrong, the blame will tend to fall directly
on Perot himself, for his party will still be identified as more of a one-man
show than any since 1968, when the American Independence Party was organized
by and for Alabama Governor George Wallace. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if Perot is the Independence Party presidential candidate, one of
the &quot;reforms&quot; most likely to develop wide public interest in 1996
will be ending the advantage allowed for rich individuals like him to buy
advertising and organizing talent that other parties must obtain through
broad solicitations. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Perot may persuade Colin Powell to run at the head of the new
party, which surely would increase the flow of individual contributions
and expand the party's showing at the polls. What opinion surveys indicate
so far is that the Independence Party would do its best with Powell as its
nominee. But the ticket still would not win. In contrast, the surveys suggest
that Powell as a Republican would win. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This raises another question. Other than Perot's o'ervaulting ambition,
what substantive reason is there for the Independence Party? Is there some
novel insight it brings to a deficient political system--as the new Republican
Party did with its clear anti-slavery message in the 1850s, which helped
it replace the badly divided Whigs? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No. Except for his anti-free trade position, Perot's main themes, including
budget cutting, echo the Republicans. The difference is that they are in
office, and he is not. They take the heat; he carps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the head of a national party, that stand-offish role will change. Ross
Perot running as an outsider, as in 1992, might make enough of an impression
on the electorate to defeat the Republicans' presidential nominee again,
and help re-elect President Clinton. But as the head of an official political
party? <BR>
<I><BR>
Wal, I don't have to tell you people, that great sucking sound is jest Ross
sinking down to the level of the rest of 'em! <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Public needn't fear budgetary 'train wreck' rhetoric </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
The noise you hear coming from Washington, D.C. is not the screeching prelude
to a budgetary &quot;train wreck.&quot; It's only the noise of a rhetoric
wreck. There is nothing at all unusual about the failure of Congress and
the President to reach agreement on a budget by the formal deadline, October
1 (this Sunday). And the &quot;crisis&quot; over the debt ceiling that is
slated to follow later on this fall is only slightly more worrisome. We
have gone through such &quot;crises&quot; many times since the 1970's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On one occasion, when Budget Director Jim Miller warned Ronald Reagan that
refusal to reach a compromise with the Democratic Congress could bring government
operations to a halt, the President replied, &quot;Jim, Jim, settle down.
Let's close the place down and see if anybody notices.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody did. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In similar stalemates now Congress almost routinely adopts a &quot;continuing
resolution&quot; that allows spending on essential services (such as defense)
and entitlements (such as Social Security) to carry on, and for other programs
to operate at a maintenance level. Such a resolution is available this weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The situation will not be much different around mid-November if Congress,
on another issue, tries to force financial discipline on the Administration
by refusing to raise the federal debt limit. Mr. Clinton and his allies
already are warning that Republican &quot;blackmail&quot; will spook the
markets. Air traffic will be grounded. Federal contractors will be stiffed.
Children will starve. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps these horror tales are meant to frighten us out of that national
&quot;funk&quot; that concerns the President. Or perhaps the Democrats are
just getting an early start on Halloween. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, all the whoops of distress have but one purpose, which is to deflect
the majority in Congress from doing what they promised: to cut the budget
now in order to balance it by 2002. The people whose careers are built on
an ever-expanding government sector--people who believe that downsizing
is only for the private sector--are going to try to make you believe that
the world is coming to an end. But it's only their political assumptions
that are ending. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get me wrong. Many proposed budget cuts are difficult to accept. Some
reductions don't make sense when considered by themselves. And almost all
of us are for government spending when it favors a cause close to our own
hearts. I can see the desirability of eliminating the national service program,
&quot;Americorps,&quot; but a student benefiting from its payments probably
does not. Consumers in Seattle and New York might cheer the overdue effort
to end farm subsidies, but it's a hard sell in Louisiana cotton country
or Wisconsin dairlyand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the truth is that relatively little of the budget savings needed
will be achieved just by cutting &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; or
even by tackling special interest spending. At some point, you have to go
into broadly popular programs. That Republicans are doing so, though gingerly,
and that these reductions are being presented before television cameras
as the mad slashing of mean-spirited conservatives, accounts for the sagging
public approval ratings of Congress. Yet, with a national debt equal to
$71,860 per family of four, we just can't afford all the good things government
intends to do for us. Spending growth needs to slacken. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, taxes do need to go down. The reason is not to make the rich richer,
but to raise our savings rate, spark the investments that create jobs and
to help working families make ends meet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question for voters is, do you really want to stay on the track to long
term economic growth, or do you want to derail the train at the first signs
of difficulty? For the Republican majority in Congress, the question is
almost identical. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most Democrats, as in the '80's, have already given their
answer: Real cuts are for budgetary &quot;outyears,&quot; Washington, D.C.'s
equivalent of the sweet-by-and-by. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 80's, when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats
controlled Congress, the tactical advantage is now with the GOP. If Congress
wants to spend, a President has few ways to prevent it. If--as now--Congress
does not want to spend, the President has even fewer ways to force it to
do so. In a contest of wills, Congress probably can stand the pressure better
than the President. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That means they also may not be deterred by short term drops in the polls.
Perhaps the left has forgotten a pertinent lesson from the past, but it
has not been forgotten by the GOP elephant. In 1990, when President George
Bush tried to force budgetary restraint on a Democratic Congress, the artificial
heat generated in the ensuing &quot;crisis&quot; was especially intense.
Bush finally cracked and backed down. In return for limited future spending
controls, he agreed to break his pledge on taxes (Remember &quot;Read my
lips&quot;?). He was a hero to the media at the time, a real statesman.
And the voters didn't seem to care much--until they trounced him soundly
in the next election. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 the Republicans ran on a Contract with America. They told the voters
exactly what they wanted to do: cut spending, cut taxes and revive America's
economic growth. And they won a history-making victory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
They are now trying to do what they promised. Boogeymen are being thrown
up to scare them off track, including Mr. Clinton's holograph of a government
&quot;train wreck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the ghost of George Bush scares them a lot more. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tithing tax break offers better reform <BR>
than block-grant push </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Wailing critics in Washington, D.C. would like you to believe that America's
poor are about to be devastated by plans to block grant welfare funds and
send them to the states. The House of Representative's desire to add specific
mandates to that approach simply raises the wailing to a higher pitch. <BR>
<BR>
But the truth is that 70 of the 80 major federal and state welfare-related
programs are not affected by the reform bills, while those that are affected
will go through a slower rate of growth, not real reductions. Adopting &quot;workfare&quot;
or allowing the states to experiment with other structural changes does
not automatically assure more innovative use of the money, let alone savings.
<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of whether the Senate bill or the House bill emerges from the
conference committee set up to reconcile their differences, and regardless
of the President's relative enthusiasm,&quot;welfare as we know it&quot;
is not really going to end. But, maybe it should. <BR>
<BR>
Why must we always turn to government--at whatever level--for welfare solutions?
Since the 1960's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; spending on cash and in-kind
transfers (cash, food, housing, energy, medical aid, etc.) has increased
640 percent in real, inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet most social problems--such
as out-of-wedlock birth rates--are far worse today. Perhaps welfare reformers
are not being &quot;radical&quot; enough. &quot;Radical,&quot; after all,
means getting at the roots, and when it comes to helping the poor, we need
to recognize that the private sectors of society--including churches and
other non-profit organizations, as well as the job-creating profit sector--tend
to do a better job than government. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to find ways to enable the non-government sectors gradually
to take on greater responsibility, while government's role is reduced. The
idea is not to leave the poor without friends, but to find them truer friends.
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana proposes to stimulate private giving with an
increase in the tax deductibility of charitable donations, from 100 to 120
percent. Reps. Joe Knollenberg of Michigan and Jim Kolbe of Arizona would
give a $100 tax credit for gifts to community groups that work with the
poor. Sen. Coats of Indiana would increase that to $500. <BR>
<BR>
In Seattle, philanthropist and former businessman Mark Bloome asserts that
society would be spiritually improved overall and the poor allowed to advance
more surely, if the old Judeo-Christian ideal of the &quot;tithe&quot; could
be reinvigorated. He does not necessarily connect his idea with welfare
reform, but welfare reform certainly would benefit from being connected
with his idea. Tithing, the gift of 10 percent of one's income to the church
or other charity, is rare today, a victim mainly of high taxes. The answer,
Bloome believes, is to provide a federal tax credit for those charitable
contributions a person makes beyond five percent of his income (which are
tax deductible) and up to ten percent (the tithe). In contrast to a mere
deduction, the tithe would encourage people to give beyond the five percent
threshold, which is already a sacrifice, while the ten percent ceiling would
prevent tax-credited benevolence from bankrupting the federal treasury.
<BR>
<BR>
Tax reform advocates, as well as welfare reformers, would do well to consider
the wisdom of ideas like Bloome's. Experience in the 80's--when marginal
tax rates were lower and charitable giving was higher--and the 90's--when
tax rates went up and charitable giving stagnated--supports the common sense
expectation that people will give more when they have more to give. Thus,
lower and flatter tax rates probably will increase charitable giving even
as they boost the overall economy and personal income growth. <BR>
<BR>
What tax reformers tend to overlook is the political, if the not the moral,
desirability of linking a more productive tax system to one that assuredly
serves the poor directly. The tithing idea would do it. <BR>
<BR>
Private charity is intrinsic to the American character. It is more personal
and voluntary, and hence more moral, than government distributed tax funds.
And it tends to be more effective. Perhaps private charity cannot supplant
all government welfare, but it can redress the present imbalance. It offers
citizens of many political persuasions a potentially better choice than
either the present welfare mess or any of the conventional political proposals
for reform. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to get radical.

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Endless campaign a poor way to choose a president&quot;
</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>By Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>

<BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
In the recent dog days of summer, over a hundred people showed up at Seattle's
Washington Institute to meet one of the superficially more improbable candidates
for President in 1996, the articulate black Republican, Alan Keyes. <BR>
<BR>
A former Reagan Administration official, Keyes believes that the decline
of the family is the central problem in society, around which almost all
other problems revolve. His message went over well. He said he'll be back
soon. <BR>
<BR>
For so many citizens to appear at such events a full year before the 1996
national nominating conventions and fifteen months before the final election
might seem remarkable. But, decision time for activists is not next spring;
it's now. <BR>
<BR>
Presidential campaigns are being organized and financed earlier than ever
before. Competition to attract attention from candidates and the media has
encouraged states to set their primaries earlier and earlier on the calendar.
As a result, the first primaries next year will come in February. Only seven
weeks later, in April, over 80 percent of all public votes for delegates
will be over. <BR>
<BR>
If candidates waited to enter the race until the primary season was nearly
underway, as Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952, they would be too late to qualify
legally, let alone to assemble a team. (Attention, Gen. Colin Powell.) A
strategy like President Franklin Roosevelt's in 1940--when he did not declare
his candidacy until the eve of the Democratic convention--is unimaginable
in our time. <BR>
<BR>
Since Washington State recently moved its own presidential primary forward
to March 26, we, too, are suddenly part of the scramble. That and fundraising
opportunities are the reasons that candidates already are showing up. Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have all flown in.
Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, who still thinks a coherent foreign policy is
important, apparently has decided that Washington could be a breakthrough
state for his candidacy and is planning several visits. Malcom S. (&quot;Steve&quot;)
Forbes, Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine (&quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;),
may visit Seattle soon after a likely declaration of candidacy this month.
Now that our primary falls on the same date as nearby California's, even
the frontrunning Sen. Bob Dole is increasing his interest in Washington
State, according to his national political consultant, Don Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Washington is a must-win state for the Democrats in the final
election, so don't be surprised to see lots of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore. <BR>
<BR>
In the month of March in past presidential election years, we were all watching
the first primary. But next March, Washington State will be taking part
in one of the last of the important ones. Thereafter, the identity of the
two presidential nominees may well be known--and then we will fall into
the rut of a six month long final election drive. Spring's excitement will
be brief, the frustrations that follow interminable. <BR>
<BR>
If you believe that democracy benefits from some relatively quiet time between
spasms of political extravagance, this is not the way to organize our national
elections. Neither a sitting president nor his opponent is likely to behave
like a statesman when a campaign atmosphere dominates. Leadership suffers
when a presidency is preoccupied with the next election for a full two years
out of a four year term of office. <BR>
<BR>
When you consider that the first six months or so of a president's term
are absorbed in putting an administration together--another process elongated
in recent times--the normal tasks of governing actually are getting only
about a year and a half of our Chief Executive's undivided attention. And
the same is true for most of his would-be opponents. <BR>
<BR>
Americans don't hate these politicians. They just get very tired of them.
But, no immediate change is possible. Party rules and presidential primary
dates are already locked into place for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
The only cure for the coming epidemic of politics-fatigue is for citizens
in this election cycle to demand that the two major parties and Congress
push the primaries back to something like their old schedule for the year
2000. Parties, for example, should pass rules precluding the seating of
convention delegates that are chosen before, say, April of an election year.
And Congress should refuse to provide candidates with federal matching funds
until roughly the same period. <BR>
<BR>
In an era of instantaneous and ubiquitous communications, why should our
political system require five times as long to choose a president as it
did in the days of Grover Cleveland?

Forward Thrust or Bust? </CENTER>

<P>The danger in next month's capital improvements election--with the Seattle
Commons, neighborhood ball parks and a big outdoor ballpark for the Mariners
on the ballot--is not that voters of Seattle and King County will lack the
facts upon which to make a sound judgment. There will be plenty of healthy
debate. The real danger, especially for young voters and newcomers, is that
the choices may take place in an historical vacuum. <BR>
<BR>
The best argument for the bond issues is that, unlike so many federal, state
and even government promises, voters in this case can be fairly sure of
what they are getting for their money. They will be able to see the results.
But if they are skeptical, they might want to review what happened with
some other great decisions in Seattle history, including most recently,
&quot;Forward Thrust.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even people who experienced it may have forgotten what that former citizens'
crusade did to make Seattle a better place to live. Indeed, our area today
is at a crucial point not unlike that of 27 years ago. The economic boom
back then had left many people worried, for the first time, that the area's
&quot;livability&quot; was threatened. Yet, voters may have been more optimistic
then, if only because family income was growing faster than it is now. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, that optimism was somewhat unwarranted. Within a couple
of years after the first and determinative Forward Thrust election of 1968,
Seattle suffered the famous &quot;Boeing recession.&quot; In the subsequent,
less hopeful atmosphere of 1970, the remaining Forward Thrust proposals
that were put on that year's ballot were defeated. <BR>
<BR>
But then a wonderful thing happened--several wonderful things, really. The
Forward Thrust projects that King County residents had approved in the palmy
days of 1968 began development in the early 70's at just the right time
to help revive the economy. A spectacular series of civic improvements ensued,
including new parks, recreation and professional sports facilities, sanitation,
fire stations, a youth service center, and community centers. It was largely
due to the major Forward Thrust projects, and the many smaller projects
inspired by them, that Seattle started winning &quot;Most Livable City&quot;
awards over the following decade. A successful 1972 vote for a metropolitican
bus system (the often-forgotten third ballot vote of the Forward Thrust
series), and the state legislature's adoption of Forward Thrust measures
to modernize SeaTac Airport and our seaport added to the momentum. <BR>
<BR>
I was newly on the City Council then and delighted with the opportunities
Forward Thrust offered Seattle. Many of them were serendipitous and unanticipated.
For example, historic preservation had not been considered when the Forward
Thrust parks proposal was planned, but by 1972 we were able to use historic
preservation techniques to find new uses for old Seattle landmarks and to
save money on building some of the &quot;new&quot; facilities Forward Thrust
had promised. <BR>
<BR>
As for the parks themselves, Forward Thrust allowed Seattle area governments
to pick up properties for what we can now see were bargain prices. For example,
the land for Mercer Island's Luther Burbank Park, presently valued at $70
million, was acquired for all of $l.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
Though capital funds were relatively plentiful in the '70's, thanks to Forward
Thrust, maintenance funds were not. But Forward Thrust inspired City Hall
to find creative ways to close much of the gap. One way was to combine projects
in order to reduce overhead expenses. Merging the new aquarium with the
Waterfront Park is an example. <BR>
<BR>
We also found we could get some of the new parks actually to generate revenue
to offset their maintenance costs, as was the case again at Waterfront Park.
Re-using the existing old piers as part of the park design was entirely
in keeping with the park's theme, and it also permitted us to expand visitor
interest with shops and restaurants. And, ever since, these private concessions
have provided the city with rent and sales tax revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the inspiration of the father of the Forward Thrust movement, Jim
Ellis, the city and county also learned how to leverage bond moneys to attract
public grants, private investments and gifts. These ranged from highway
funds and a new private building that helped make Freeway Park possible
to private flower garden donations for the park's operations. Thus, the
citizens of Seattle and King County actually got far more than they voted
for. How often does that happen with government? <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the total bond moneys of $330 million were nearly doubled by federal
and state public grants, along with private investments and gifts ($240
million), plus interest on the bonds ($55 million). Throw in the increased
property values of recent decades, and Forward Thrust turns out to have
been the best bargain for Seattleites since we built the City Light hydroelectric
dams at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
People over 40 often ask what happened to the kind of enlightened and inventive
civic leadership that gave us Forward Thrust. Part of the answer is that
while contemporary Americans demand leadership, we denigrate leaders. We
are particularly cynical about motives now, even with citizen volunteers.
And then there is the problem of time. Back in the '60's, Jim Ellis expected
to spend less than two years on Forward Thrust and wound up devoting seven.
Today's extensive approval processes and other hurdles make public projects
exhausting for citizen leaders. <BR>
<BR>
But the rest of the answer to the leadership question is more heartening.
The truth is that both the Seattle Commons idea and the proposal to build
a new outdoor stadium initially arose from outside of government and have
elicited almost exactly the same quality of citizen spirit that gave us
Forward Thrust-or, earlier, the Century 21 World's Fair that left us the
Seattle Center. <BR>
<BR>
Over several years more than 2500 citizens from all walks of life have donated
personal time, financial contributions and talent to the Commons idea. At
first, there was not even any great interest from the organized business
community or from government. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hidden agenda. The uncommon Commons vision is persuasive because
it has just the right mix of boldness and prudence, like Forward Thrust.
The vision is to create 18,000 good new jobs, anchor a good share of the
city's new, multi-income housing growth at the south end of Lake Union,
with a landmark central park that everyone can use, and in the process help
reduce urban sprawl and traffic congestion. It will be a model of a more
sensible urban envirornment. <BR>
<BR>
As with Forward Thrust, the citizens who have thrown themselves into the
Commons effort have figured out how to blend many aims to produce a package
with wide appeal. The neighborhood ballparks are needed, though they are
not urgent. But the plan to use the Commons project as a means to solve
the near-legendary Mercer Street traffic mess is an excellent case of sound
multi-purpose planning. <BR>
<BR>
The Commons, if adopted, probably will excel Forward Thrust in attracting
private investments and and already has done so with philanthropic gifts
and loans. The Commons group also has figured out how to attract money from
outside the area. As an immediate consequence of approval of the Commons'
bonds, $18 million of bond funds will be used to secure matching state and
federal highway grants to widen the Mercer corridor and put it underground.
<BR>
<BR>
When you think of it, the Forward Thrust spirit is also alive in the unfairly-maligned
plan to build a Mariners ballpark. It, too, will be multi-purpose, not just
the place for a baseball fan to enjoy a soft summer night, but a place for
any of us, and our children, to enjoy a wide range of civic events and celebrations.
And thanks to an ingenious retractable roof, it will work regardless of
the weather. <BR>
<BR>
The ballpark proposal bespeaks the all too-unusual civic dedication of the
wealthy individuals who risked their own money--starting with the Japanese
owner of Nintendo who effectively gifted us with $50 million--to save the
local professional baseball team. That is what we now have on the line.
<BR>
<BR>
You don't put your money into a baseball team in Seattle to get rich (or
richer) these days, whatever you may tell your spouse. And you don't go
to endless Commons meetings to advance your career. Maybe you step forward
because you are nostalgic for your youth, or for the dreams you had of the
city you'd like to see, or maybe you are that old fashioned type of person
who believes in the concept of civic virtue. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its source, we can't buy that kind of civic spirit at any price.
Like the citizens of the ancient Roman republic--or Seattle at the high
points of its history--we can only try to call it forth. <BR>
<BR>
This town has lots of other needs and opportunities beyond those on the
current ballot. But that is not a reason for discouragement. We also have
better prospects than we have ever enjoyed. Surely we would like to see
more of the newly wealthy Seattleites step up to the challenge of philanthropy
and to endow our next genereation with new civic advantages--in schools,
city beautification, housing, camps, museums, public gardens, transportation
amenities, music, medical care, and job opportunities. But, how do we entice
our new millionaires to play this role unless we honor those who do? <BR>
<BR>
This town, as part of its heritage, also probably has more than its fair
share of talented potential citizen leaders, regardless of financial resources,
good people of a new generation whose imagination, know-how and drive we
would like to enlist for our community's benefit. They will do the volunteer
chores others shirk. But what do we have to entice those individuals--other
than the respect we pay them by taking their efforts seriously? <BR>
<BR>
Is ours going to be the era of Forward Bust? Or are we headed for another
Forward Thrust, with all the good it can bring us? The September ballot
will not finally answer that question. But it can become an important sign
that civic confidence--and the calling forth of public service--is once
again ignited. It can light our way. <BR>
<BR>
If you doubt what such measures can do for a city, drive around. Many of
the best features of contemporary Seattle sprang from the public spirited
efforts of earlier citizens, including the Progressive Era generation at
the turn of the century who built our first comprehensive boulevard and
parks systems, the ship canals and locks, our exemplary water reservoirs
and power dams and the Denny Regrade. Those folks are all gone. <BR>
<BR>
But the Forward Thrust generation, most of them, are still here. From our
clean water to a vibrant cultural life, you also can see their works. The
point is that Seattle did not become the envy of the nation by accident.
Seattle citizens--with remarkable frequency--have made wise choices at the
right time. <BR>
<BR>
Just look around you.

</H2>
<BR>
Good morning, and Happy Leap Year, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I am honored to be asked my opinion about the 2000 Census.<BR>
Leap Year, indeed, is a good time to review the Census Bureau's plans, because
a great statistical leap into the 21st century is what the Bureau is proposing.
The Congress may wish to look very hard before you take this leap, however,
because it is a leap into the unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly concerned about the plan to use sampling to adjust the
hard count for the 2000 Census. Looked at through a green eye shade, it
may seem prudent. Obviously, it is financially burdensome to obtain the
last 10 percent or so of Census names, so sampling looks like a winning
solution. Undoubtedly that thought must have weighed heavily in the recommendations
of several bodies that are advocating adjustment. But if money is what matters
most, you could save even more by relying on still more sampling. The Census
is, indeed, expensive. But consider what you get with it. It holds up the
whole statistical system of the Unite States. Having said that, I do acknowledge
the legitimacy of the cost issue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The statistical accuracy argument must also be acknowledged. It is embarrassing
to have an undercount after every decennial Census. However, it is an embarrassment
the republic has managed to survive each decade for two centuries. I am
not sure how well we would survive its alternative. The problem with sampling
and adjustment does not lie only with accuracy, which statisticians can
debate, but with its admitted core of artificiality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My argument with adjustment, thus, is not primarily a matter of statistical
methodology. That's not my background, in any case. If anybody could pull
off an adjustment in a conscientious manner it is the U.S. Census Bureau.
My experiences at the Bureau left me with the greatest respect for the honesty,
ability and public spirit of the people who work there, right up to and
including the outstanding current director, Dr. Martha Riche. Moreover,
many of the statistical and management innovations the Bureau has proposed
for the 2000 Census, including new &quot;matching&quot; software to spot
double-counting, the digital &quot;capture&quot; of data on forms, more
user-friendly forms and the added mail contacts with each address, all have
excellent prospects, in my view. The 2000 Census, as with past censuses,
will see improvements, regardless of adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should an official adjustment take place, however, and you have one national
number, the Census will still not have counted everyone, even in theory.
For example, the present plan will have done nothing to count the literally
hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not employed by the government
and who are temporarily living overseas. (Overseas government employees
now are counted, of course.) The people I'm talking about are U.S. citizens;
some of them own homes and other property here; some are on the voter roles
and motor vehicle license lists. I certainly agree with the proposal to
explore the use of many other administrative records, such as Social Security
and welfare rolls, to seek names of people who may have been missed in the
Census head count. I also understand why the Bureau must count illegal immigrants,
even though they may lack reliable addresses and their stay in this country
may be very temporary, indeed. But shouldn't we also be trying to identify
citizens of the U.S. who happen to be out of the country around the Census
time, but whose names can be found in public records and who count the United
States as home? Isn't their stake in the country important enough to be
reflected in the numbers that are used, for example, to apportion Congress?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer given by the Census Bureau, with OMB no doubt looking over its
shoulder, is that such a search would be costly. Well, if so, why isn't
it proposed to sample and adjust for the overseas Americans, too? But, meanwhile,
the controversy of this very subject returns us again to the central problem
in the 2000 Census plan, and that is the moral or philosophical concept
of an official, adjusted enumeration. Sampling is a proven and accepted
form of measurement, but there usually has to be some hard, broadly accepted
data base from which the sample is drawn. More importantly, I can't think
of a statistical sample that is so closely tied to a civic act as is the
Census enumeration, any more than I can think of an election survey that
has the moral authority of an actual election.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census enumeration is a participatory function of government hallowed
by Constitutional mandate. There are not too many comparable civic acts;
voting is one, serving on juries is another. Perhaps participation in the
Census falls between those two--it is neither as voluntary as voting, nor
as demanding as jury service. In any case, the Census is one of the fundamental
democratic institutions of our society, and I believe, it is a noble one.
It gives us the numbers that make other numbers meaningful. It must not
only be trustworthy, but palpably trustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The current Census director herself has spoken of the three legs of the
Census stool that must dictate the process: cost, accuracy and public perception.
The first two legs are important, as I have acknowledged, but if the latter
breaks, the whole construction comes down. The term &quot;public perception&quot;
could also be described as trustworthiness. In a time when public mistrust
of government is rife, I question a change that would introduce the invention
of statistical persons into the Census--robots constructed of sampled data
and intellectual abstractions--to stand in the place of real human beings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census has long represented an honest attempt to count every person
in the United States--every real person, not every &quot;virtual&quot; person,
not every &quot;statistical analog&quot; for a person, not every &quot;full
time equivalent&quot; of a person, but every real person. Once citizens
realize that the Census number is partly an invention--however brilliant
an invention it is--they will begin to question many things. Suspicions
will be aroused. How, some will ask, do we know that the creation of statistical
persons does not have some partisan or factional or geographic regional
basis? How does this corrupted Census count infect other numbers and political
institutions?<BR>
Let me stress again my own full confidence in the integrity of the individuals
who serve at the U.S. Census Bureau. It is largely because I don't want
to see that integrity even put up to question that I raise this problem
of perception--of evident trustworthiness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's next consider legal problems with the Census; do you think you have
them now? In fact, the costly lawsuits challenging the Census invariably
are won by the government. Common sense tells a judge that a good faith
effort to count every person cannot be faulted for occasional human mistakes,
especially when plaintiffs can seldom if ever produce evidence of actual
individuals who have not been counted. But under an adjusted Census it will
not be difficult at all to produce evidence that the Census erred, and erred
intentionally, by imputing fictitious people into neighborhoods where the
real neighbors can readily prove that the interlopers do not, in plain truth,
exist. In some cases, the fictional, imputed people are going to amount
to a difference between drawing a redistricting line one place rather than
another, and maybe even change the apportionment of states. (After all,
isn't that part of the whole idea?) In such cases, I suggest, common sense
will now become the government's enemy, because you will need to give all
the judges and ordinary citizens an extensive course in statistics to persuade
them that it is just and fair to invent people for something as supposedly
straightforward as a U.S. Census. How especially do we explain including
invented people in determining such matters as apportioning Congress when,
as I noted before, we do not count real American citizens living abroad?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the American public will accept all this with total unconcern or even
satisfaction. But maybe, instead, this will be seen as one more way the
government is trying to pull a fast one on the people. Won't any resulting
public cynicism make the hard count even more difficult to obtain in the
first place? If it contributes to further falloff of response, won't that
and the ever-present financial incentives, lead to still more sampling in
subsequent Censuses, in a downward spiral? And won't it seem perfectly acceptable
soon to conduct the whole Census through sampling? And won't there be an
irrestible temptation to try, Census by Census, to improve the content of
what constitutes the invented persons created through the sample, and hence
the meaning of such invented persons?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am here to urge
you to look at the Census as one of the most venerable civic institutions
of the United States, and to do all you can to protect it. Once trust in
it is undermined, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to restore. <BR>

Today the craft  of film-making is awe inspiring, but the sensibility is often pernicious.  Take three leading contenders for Oscars, The English Patient, The People  vs. Larry Flynt and Evita. All three films display adroit writing, acting  and editing. And all three use the bedazzling tricks of Hollywood to gain  audience sympathy for scoundrels.</P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The English Patient presents us with a handsome count in North Africa who,  as World War II approaches, seduces a friend's wife (and much of the theater  audience). When they are nearly killed by her jealous husband, the count  leaves her wounded in the desert to get help. He is arrested mistakenly  by the British, kills an innocent guard and then, to get a plane to return  him to his lover, offers precious maps of the desert to the Germans, helping  to doom thousands of British soldiers. The person after whom the story  is modeled, Count Almasy, was in fact a spy for the Nazis and later the  Soviets. Yet there were many wet eyes at the end of the film about this  irresponsible relativist. After all, who are we to judge such a romantic  figure?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  A hero's mantle from the costume racks also magically transforms Hustler  magazine publisher, Larry Flynt. No pander was ever half so endearing as  actor Woody Harrelson portrays Flynt. Gloria Steinhem for once has it right:  The real-life Flynt earns his millions by degrading women, in some cases  celebrating violence done to them. In an apparently successful effort to  disarm viewers, the film almost admits as much, but we are supposed to  be charmed.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Businessman Flynt uses the First Amendment strictly to protect his production  of salable sex, but the film offers him up as a rustic champion of a robust  Constitution, just a little left of Tom Paine. Could manipulated theatergoers,  like the woman seated behind me, who exclaimed loudly that the film was  the &quot;best movie I have ever seen,&quot; be made to feel the same about  a film toasting pedophilia or bestiality?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Very possibly so, because the point of the Flynt film is that the First  Amendment is absolute and that those who constantly extend the plumbing  of its depths deserve not just legal toleration and fat bank accounts,  but also the public's thanks. Understandably, the real Larry Flynt, however  rich, is used to being a social pariah. But a few days ago he was invited  onto a national TV talk show and was delighted--and amazed-- by the immense  ovation that greeted him. Hollywood has lionized another skunk.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Then there is Evita. This is the film with a screenplay co-authored by  Oliver Stone, who has done so much for bogus history in JFK and Nixon.  It arguably is the worst film of the three exactly because its lying is  the most persuasive. Stuffed with rolls of cinematic gauze, the satirical  bite of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original stage musical is reduced to gumming.  In the lyrics of Tim Rice an echo of sarcasm remains, but it is lost in  the visual schmaltz. Imagery and music easily drown out words in a film  whose makers have fallen in love with the villains.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Oh, people are shown getting beaten up by the Peronistas and there is a  sly allusion (but only that) to Juan Peron's similarities to Benito Mussolini.  But you would have to guess that the Perons themselves were responsible  for the beatings and murders, and you would hardly imagine that the Italians  who pelted Eva with eggs during her visit to Rome did so because Juan Peron  had been an outspoken admirer of Il Duce and Der Fuehrer. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  In the film there is no disclosure that the Perons were anti-Semitic or  that they welcomed up to 15,000 escaping Nazis at the close of World War  II, raking in untold millions in gold from them. The Perons' economic policies--in  the film, an amusing redistribution of wealth from the stuffy privileged  classes--resulted in long term financial desolation for all classes. At  one time living standards in Argentina rivaled Canada's. Thanks largely  to the Perons, Argentina sank to third world status.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  But in today's Hollywood, Eva Peron's sins are washed away and restored  as 90's virtues. Her sexual power-seeking warrants admiring chuckles; what  pluck! On screen, she is a Latin feminist, seizing authority from hidebound  men who don't realize that glamour has a right to rule. Her propaganda  lines and staged humility (&quot;I only bring the people to the heart of  Peron!&quot;) no longer ring hollow, as in Andrew Lloyd Webber's play.  They chime cheerily to a generation of movie-goers who know little of fascism.  The film's violence is just an exotic backdrop for Webber's operatic themes  and Madonna's fashion parade.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, Madonna is the perfect vehicle for Oliver Stone's mock-populist  revisionism. Perhaps we can see her next as poor, misunderstood Lady Mac  Beth, and after that the noted &quot;Renaissance woman,&quot; Lucretia  Borgia. Then she can rehabilitate that suffering citizen of revolutionary  France, Madame Lafarge.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There are so many historical and fictional rascals left, each of whose  appearance needs to be uplifted by Hollywood's celluloid implants.<BR>  <BR>  </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery  Institute.

At least one early morning  a week, you will find George Benson, 78, down on the waterfront picking  up trash along the tracks or over at the car barn shining glass lenses  on the headlamps of the city's vintage streetcars. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why such devotion? &quot;It's my baby!&quot; George  exclaims. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, it is. Back in 1974 Councilman Benson had the idea that Seattle  should retrieve part of its abandoned transportation heritage, streetcars.  Not &quot;trolleys&quot; that run on wires, mind you, but real streetcars  that run on tracks. Like other American cities, Seattle once had an intricate  web of them, including an &quot;Interurban&quot; that could take you to  Everett or Tacoma in about the time you can make it now in an auto at rush  hour. The automotive lobby long ago seduced Seattle and most other cities  into abandoning streetcars, and only in recent years have modern variations  on the old theme begun to return to fashionability. But rare are the lucky  burgs with old fashioned, strap-hanging, bell-clanging streetcars. New  Orleans. Philadelphia. San Francisco, of course.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  And, thanks to George Benson, Seattle. On one short line from the Myrtle  Edwards Park at the north end of the waterfront, along Alaska Way to Pioneer  Square and on to the International District, Metro operates five beautifully  restored vehicles that together carry nearly 500,000 passengers a year.  Many passengers take advantage of Seattle's general policy of free transit  within downtown (a policy also dating to the '70's). But another large  group--177,971, to be exact--are paying customers, most of them tourists  taking in the sights.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There were other municipal advocates of a new/old streetcar route back  in 1974. But it was George Benson, the enthusiast, who persevered with  such detailed attention that all obstacles (lack of local car stock, the  need for businesses to support a local improvement district, safety concerns,  and on and on) gradually were overcome--after only eight and a half years  of effort.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was one of George's colleagues on the Council, and now I am an occasional  customer of his streetcars, which I find ideal for showing visitors our  town. So when we talked at a recent dinner for former and present Council  members, I told Geroge I had a dream that I bet he shared: to extend the  current one-way, back and forth route into a loop. With a loop line, passengers  could expand the current trip to the waterfront, Pioneer Square, the Kingdome  and the International District into a grander tour of downtown, adding  the Municipal and County buildings, the financial district, the art museum,  the forthcoming symphony hall, hotels, and shopping opportunities around  Westlake Mall and the Convention Center, followed by a jaunt across the  newly trendy Denny Regrade to Seattle Center before heading back to the  waterfront for another loop.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was right. George lit up like a streetcar beacon. A loop route is his  secret passion. We have been talking precise routes ever since. It's a  game anyone can play, so readers are invited to share their concepts, too.  But in this game there are a couple of rules. For one, these streetcars  cannot go down a steep incline, so east-west routes in the center of our  hilly downtown won't work. For another, many motorists are made nervous  by the strangeness of a streetcar next to them, so a new route should not  cram streetcars and autos too closely together. Beyond all, safety must  prevail. People are used to dodging cars, but not streetcars--despite the  ringing bells.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It isn't hard to find fault with the idea. Because so many passengers travel  free, the present route doesn't pay for itself directly. (Of course, neither  do buses downtown.) A loop route might attract still more passengers, but  it is hard to see it breaking even under present pricing arrangements.  Also, the Engineering Department, which must guide any new development,  is anxious about congestion that may eventuate as new tracks head back  through busy north/south avenues.<BR>  A little imagination and Bensonian grit in the current city leadership  might help at this point. Perhaps the streetcar route could go through  the bus tunnel under Third Avenue. Perhaps a little longer trip at the  north end of a loop, along Denny Way past the Pacific Science Center to  Bay Street, would provide a sufficiently gradual grade to assure streetcar  traction. Perhaps the relatively high ridership of the system would allow  its integration into the new regional and intermodal transit plan and help  cover startup costs.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Certainly a streetcar loop would be popular with visitors, and, in fact,  maybe all of us who use it should--on this one downtown run--pay the going  cost. To have the pleasure of getting from one attractive destination to  another on an easy-to-comprehend streetcar loop would make Seattle's downtown  even more appealing, especially in the rain--for locals as well as tourists.  Starting, of course, with George Benson.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  <B>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery Institute.

When such a law is passed,  Congressmen will be arresting each other literally right and left, until  there's no one around to run the country. Rather, the sane solution heads  in the opposite direction: admit that scandal-mongering has become a degenerative  disease of democracy and rewrite our over-regulatory laws to give politicians  some slack. Allow more room for conflicting interpretations of political  &quot;truth&quot; and reduce penalties to a point that a legislator is  not threatened with ruin for a minor failing. Towering cases of real corruption  might be more visible in our system if we did not permit puny underbrush  to obstruct the view. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Representative government accepts that people with different philosophies  and different stakes are going to see things differently. Politics is supposed  to make a virtue of these disagreements so that voters can make up their  own minds at election time. However, what the current ethics laws and regulations  do is change politics from a game where the point is to impress public  opinion at election time to one whose purpose is to destroy the opposition  personally in a legal setting. The problem goes back a generation or more,  but it is getting worse. As we are seeing, even the House Ethics Committee,  which has standing only under House rules and is not a court, can become  so preoccupied with legal-sounding procedural issues that members from  the two parties can hardly speak to each other any more, let alone work  together. Cooperation on any subject is now endangered.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It needs saying that citizens as well as politicians bring their biases  to these matters. For all of us, there are three mental and moral exercises  that might help bring such bias to the surface and put issues into proper  perspective. The first is to imagine a reversal of identities in the parties  to a given conflict and see if, in that case, one would feel the same way.  For example, if a Democrat, instead of Newt Gingrich, had raised money  for a non-profit organization to finance a college course with what some  people could interpret as a partisan point of view, would that have been  seen as seriously reprehensible? If a Republican member of Congress had  distributed a tape of a cellular phone call to friendly news media, as  Rep. Jim McDermott is accused of doing, would that be have been seen as  materially different?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Secondly, one can ask in these ethics cases how a particular standard applied  to politicians would look if it were applied to critics in the media. It  supposedly is terrible if a politician &quot;misleads&quot; his collegues.  But media commentators mislead the public quite often, for roughly similar  reasons: ignorance, prejudice, stress, time pressure, recklessness. You  could hardly hold a Sunday TV talk show anymore if the shouting heads were  held legally responsible for their veracity. Why, to use another example,  is it reprehensible that Jim McDermott passed along an illicit phone tape  to the New York Times (if indeed he did), while there is no discussion  at all about the propriety of the Times' publishing a transcript of it?  Do we only care about violations of privacy by private citizens and politicians,  never by the media? </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Third, one might explore the practical circumstances and conequences, not  just the formal cause, of the alleged ethical misbehavior. Circumstances  and consequences count. Did someone abuse his office for personal gain,  or was it a mainly political maneuver? Who was really hurt, how much and  in what way? Gingrich's course wound up being non-partisan, in fact, and  was never used for the Speaker's financial advantage. His &quot;misleading&quot;  paperwork submitted to the Ethics Committee, though wrong, related to a  non-crime. Likewise, McDermott's supposed delivery of a telephone tape  to The New York Times was a political blunder more than a crime, an ethics  weapon that backfired.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  If all sides in Congress could declare a temporary truce, they might spend  some time trying to reform the ethics laws and regulations so that petty  infractions are given only proportionate punishment. Under more realistic  rules, the legal payoff for exaggerating scandals necessarily would diminish  (for media as well as politicians) and today's gladiators-to-the-death  would become merely happy warriors, their conflicts ritualized in more  traditional parliamentary forms. The business of government could proceed  on its more or less dignified course. Politics as usual. It actually would  be a relief.<BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

Poor old Will!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	     Why, I never knew the old fellow was ill!&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But he is ill, at least in a majority of the universities  of America, where a new report shows that even English majors no longer  are required to take a course on one of the greatest writers--if not the  greatest--in any language.  The report, &quot;The Shakespeare File:  What  English Majors are Really Studying,&quot; produced by the National Alumni  Forum, provides an insight into declining academic standards overall and  the growing failure even to acknowledge standards.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At Georgetown University, for example, you can still  take a course on Shakespeare, but despite a university administration effort  to cloud the issue, you can graduate as an &quot;English major&quot; without  doing so.  The emphasis now is on &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;a wide range  of literary and non-literary genres such as mass media.&quot;  Within such  &quot;genres&quot; are courses in &quot;Gangster Films&quot; and &quot;Detective  Fiction as Social Critique.&quot;  In the latter course the student learns  what detective novels tell us about &quot;the nuclear family, traditional  masculine values, and capitalist ideology.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You can understand why a 19 year old would rather take  some temporarily trendy course on gangster films than something he knows  little about, like Shakespeare, but whose worth and universal significance  have been proven over centuries.  But what parent forking over $30,000  a year to Georgetown wants the English major debased by such topical triflings?   Where is the foundation--the &quot;canon,&quot; in academic terms--upon  which a life of reading and reflection is erected?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the National Alumni Forum's report, the  trend not only is widespread, but dominant.  Out of 70 of the nation's  top colleges and universities (including those listed in the annual report  of U.S. News and World Report), &quot;only 23 now require English majors  to take a course in Shakespeare.  At Duke, Shakespeare yields to &quot;Melodrama  and Soap Opera,&quot; at Oberlin &quot;The Uses of Deviance.&quot;  Other  schools offer English--yes, English--classes in sports, textile trade,  theme parks, third world liberation struggles, mail-order brides, computer  games, advertising imagery and world fairs.  A high sounding course at  Cornell on the &quot;Languages of Community&quot; really involves study  of &quot;innovative cultural texts such as alternative 'zines, Nuyorican  performance poetry, and Internet News groups.&quot; (Note:  &quot;'zines&quot;  means magazines and &quot;Nuyorican&quot; means New Yorker.  Big deal.)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Alumni Forum report comments on the strange &quot;combination  of low culture with high theory (in many courses), as if enough theoretical  jargon made any subject worth study.&quot;  At Bowdoin College, &quot;An  Introduction to Literary Theory through Popular Culture&quot; provides  a &quot;structuralist, deconstructive, feminist, psychoanalytic, new historicist,  African-American, and lesbian and gay theory&quot; on such matters as &quot;best-selling  novels, music videos, Hollywood films, and soap opera.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why?  It cannot be that Shakespeare no longer is worthy  of an audience or is irrelevant to our age.  The audience is still there.   There have never been so many new films of Shakespeare's plays and adaptations  of them.  Imaginative new versions of Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are just  now opening, for example.  Sneak Previews' critic Michael Medved says that  Shakespeare &quot;is the hottest thing going in film right now.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Shakespeare may be irrelevant, indeed, to the careers  of English professors who obtained degrees in the riotous 60's.  They seem  unable to identify with an artist who was not at war with his times, whose  genius it was to perfectly express the society of his period even while  brilliantly transcending it.  They prefer the post-modern sensibility that  conceives of the artist's job as confronting and shocking society, even  though the confrontation is a pose and the shocks quickly wear thin.  They  regard the continuing high reputation of Shakespeare outside the university  as the rueful Cassius did Caesar:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Like a Colossus, and we petty men</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Walk under his legs and peep about</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	They also may believe that teaching of a long tradition  in literature does nothing to enhance their own stature among their academic  peers.  You don't attract attention by teaching Shakespeare, Chaucer and  Milton these days; you attract it by inventing new forms of literary criticism  that only other colleagues read.  Maybe that's their idea of the business  they are in.  But, again, why would any parent want to pay for such self-dramatizing  mediocrity?  Do we really want to reward Professor Glutz for his marvelous  insights into soap operas, or to teach Macbeth and Midsummer Night's Dream?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Of course, knocking the bust of Shakespeare off its pedestal  is only an indication of the tyranny of levelling in our culture.  A whole  range of great and tested authors, not just Shakespeare, endures the academy's  neglect.  Forget for a moment the divisions of liberal and conservative,  rich and poor.  Some of the worst damage to our cohesion as a people now  comes from supposed experts in education who denigrate lasting achievements  and celebrate the notional.  It is giving us two societies:  a small, remnant  strata that enjoys and benefits from the inspiration of our civilization's  long traditions, and the consumerist, throw-away culture that screams its  adoration of pop idols before discarding them for something still newer.   At peril is the Thomas Jefferson vision of a democratic culture that elevates  all.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is not new that a majority of citizens don't know  much of Shakespeare--or of the great figures of history, economics, philosophy  or science.  What is new is that university graduates--sometimes supposed  specialists, as in English departments--don't know about them either and,  most importantly, are not expected to.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This latest news about falling academic standards in  English, in particular, has serious implications for the next generation  of teachers of high school, who can hardly introduce children to the glories  of King Lear or Henry IV if they are barely acquainted with them themselves.   It is a sad loss for our culture, where next to the Bible (which terrifies  many colleges as well as common schools), Shakespeare is the well from  which writers of all kinds have drawn deepest inspiration for four centuries--writers  who shared their allusions with the whole reading public.  It's more bad  news for newspapers, for the theater (especially the various Shakespeare  festivals) and eventually even films. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is terrible news for the regents and trustees of our  colleges and universities.  The National Alumni Forum makes it clear that  most university English departments are so lost in political correctness  and intellectual consumerism that they cannot be reformed from within.   They will have to be rescued by the people who have ultimate legal responsibility,  college and university trustees.  Most trustees would rather duck the responsibility,  but ethically they cannot.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If English departments will not stress the generally  recognized best in English and American literature, Dr. Jerry Martin of  the Alumni Forum says, it plainly is up to trustees to call together a  distinguished national panel of professors to critique such departments  for the trustees' benefit and recommend changes (as the Forum itself did).   But perhaps another panel also could give advice:  Bring in the leading  practitioners of good writing in our society, the men and women who have  won fiction and non-fiction prizes, and the newspaper and magazine editors  and book editors of greatest distinction.  Ask them about these trends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Conservatives who despair that the problem of lowering  standards in the academy is a disease recognized only by themselves might  be surprised by the broad support--left as well as right--the Shakespeare  report has elicited out in the real world.  Martin Peretz of the liberal  New Republic magazine, for example, praised the Alumni Forum report, as  did Robert Brustein of the American Repertory Theater.  Roger Shattuck,  University Professor, Boston University, stated, &quot;The (current) situation  constitutes a breech of contract.  In fact, parents should sue for breech  of contract.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some English department chairs probably will assert that  their preferences merely reflect new scholarly understandings, perhaps  accessible only to academics; and under their breath they will rail against  efforts to resurrect &quot;dead white males&quot; like Shakespeare.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let them read Maya Angelou, the African American poet  who appeared at President Clinton's first inaugural.  Chided for reading  Shakespeare as a youth, Angelou recounts (in <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird  Sings</I>), &quot;...(Y)ears later, when I physically and psychologically  left that country, that condition, which is Stamps Arkansas...I found myself  and still find myself, whenever I like, stepping back into Shakespeare.   Whenever I like I pull him to me.  He wrote it for me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I all alone beweep my outcast state</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And look upon myself and curse my fate,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	With what I most enjoy contented least...'</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Of course he wrote it for me,&quot; Angelou continues;  &quot;that is the condition of the black woman.  Of course, he was a black  woman.  I understand that.  Nobody else understands it; but I know that  William Shakespeare was a black woman.  That is the role of art.&quot;</FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Maya Angelou understands.  The National Alumni Forum    understands.

Instead of coming up with  a list of New Year's Resolutions for 1997, it appears that our public leaders  are putting together a list of New Year's Irresolutions. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  At the top of the list is Social Security reform. The advisory council  on Social Security recommends that the private investment market be used  to shore up the nation's endangered old age insurance system. Failure to  do so offers the prospect of higher payroll taxes and benefit reductions  in the years ahead, while prompt action to link Social Security to the  private sector and the &quot;miracle of compound interest&quot; offers  nothing less than capitalistic ownership of the means of production by  the entire workforce and a better retirement for everyone. Seldom has there  been a subject where the choices are so clear and where so many are affected  so deeply. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Yet the initial reaction of politicians to the latest call for action is--irresolution.  The typical official response is &quot;cautious,&quot; which in government  lingo means, &quot;Let's punt.&quot; In private, Republicans embrace the  idea and such Democrats as the influential Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New  York acknowledge that it needs to be addressed. Some other Democrats, including  the President, are thought to be supportive of reform. However, excepting  Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, they are not about to say so. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Social Security reform is only one of the 600  pound policy gorillas officialdom is determined to ignore in hopes that  maybe they will go away. The solvency of Medicare is still more pressing,  so it will take the full concentration of our leaders to pretend that they  are doing something about that problem while doing nothing.<BR>  The same goes for tax reform, upon which the government also has resolved  to be irresolute. The distilled opinion coming out of the election campaign  was that tax cuts could stimulate growth and stabilize the economy. Dole's  proposed 15% rate reduction across the board may never have caught fire,  and neither did Clinton's parade of &quot;targeted&quot; cuts, but everyone  professed to believe that something could and should be done. Now that  talk apparently can be filed under &quot;Campaign Rhetoric.&quot; </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maybe in the information age it doesn't matter  whether the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation, the tax code punishes  marriage and raising children and discourages investment. Maybe we have  repealed economic cycles and are fated to plug along with low, but satisfactory  growth. Maybe. But nothing in economics is as seductive--and wrong--as  the impression that present trends can be extended indefinitely into the  future. The statesman knows that and looks ahead. So where are the statesmen?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Next on the list of New Years Irresolutions comes the long range foreign  policy of this country. You would think that we had made the world safe  and serene forever and that violence in the Middle East or the Balkans  are simply curiosities on the evening news. Are think tanks and recently  retired generals warning us about reduced fighting readiness in the US  military and demoralization in the ranks over gender issues? Defense can  wait until we discover a breakdown in the course of an emergency. Put it  all on the New Year's Irresolutions List. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  How about the environmental reforms that both liberals and conservatives  supposedly agree need addressing? Liberal environmentalists professedly  realize that the current, mainly proscriptive laws read great, but are  not really protecting the environment. Conservatives continue to complain  that the same laws handicap the economy and actually make sensible conservation  more difficult. It is time to find a pathway to reform--of the Environmental  Protection Agency, for example, and of the Endangered Species Act, for  another--that aims more at consequences than procedural purity. Any takers?  Or do we put the environment also on the Irresolutions list?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Telecommunications mistakes found in the 1996 act? Live with them. Impending  disaster with Amtrak? Hold off hearings until everyone agrees--in the sweet  bye and bye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The great thing about such a long list of New Year's Irresolutions is that  it frees the body politic to attend to matters that are much more amusing,  if infinitely less important: petty scandals. We already are into the middle  of January and the topic that Congress and the media find most engrossing  is whether Newt Gingrich used non-profit money to organize a partisan college  course, or used political funds to organize a non-partisan college course.  Now, if you don't find that sexy, look to the Paula Jones scandal spread  over the latest issue of Newsweek. What's the future of Social Security,  the solvency of Medicare and the state of America's defenses in comparison  to a soap opera like that?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><BR><B><I>Bruce Chapman, president of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute,writes on this page each Friday.</I></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><B><I></I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But that assumption goes almost  wholly uninspected. Few people know what actually was taught in the course,&quot;Renewing  American Civilization.&quot; Media accounts have utterly failed to give  details on it. That is entirely unnecessary, for the classes were video  taped and the tapes have been for sale for three years through a &quot;1-800&quot;  number (none of which profits Gingrich personally).</P>  <P>	Seeing the charge of alleged ethics violations start to develop last  fall I decided to get a full set of the tapes. &quot;Oh, joy,&quot; my  wife said dryly when they arrived in a big box, &quot;twenty hours of Newt  Gingrich!&quot; With a somewhat heavy heart myself, I sat down at the VCR.  But, fortunately, Gingrich at length is far more nuanced and interesting  than the sound bite Gingrich on the TV news.</P>  <P>	At heart, as he told the Ethics Committee, Gingrich is a professor.  Years ago, when he first entered Congress, I visited his office several  times, and before I could get to my business I had to hear all about the  latest four or five books he had read. Then he would wait expectantly for  me to write down the titles. I'm told he still does it.  Sen. Pat Moynihan  of New York, another former academic, will make you listen at length to  his interpretations of history, but at least he doesn't expect you to take  notes. </P>  <P>	Gingrich on camera in front of a class is just the same, only now he  has assembled  his ideas into a public policy tour of grand ambition. The  title, &quot;Renewing American Civilization,&quot; sounds grandiose, but  the product turns out to be well-organized and coherent. It is something  he almost alone in Congress (again excepting Moynihan) could have accomplished.  </P>  <P>	Gingrich argues for American exceptionalism, describing from history  the decisve effects inventors and entrepreneurs have had upon our economic  rise and the moral as well as self-interested grounds  for an internationalist  foreign policy and free trade. His grasp of technology's role in shaping  a better future is masterful. At the same time, he recounts with specificity  the unintended effects of sixty years of welfare state policies onAmerican  culture, leaving us with two societies--the educated and uneducated, the  successful and the unsuccessful. His examination of inner city problems  is one of serious concern. Finally, he analyzes the economic and social  strategies that various individuals have proposed to restore to all citizens'  control over their own destinies.</P>  <P>	 Having once taken the famous college course on American Intellectual  History taught by Professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a politically active  Democrat, I found the Gingrich class comparably engaging. There is this  distinction, however: Gingrich's course is less partisan. It displays a  Gingrich conversant with a wide array of knowledge and able to synthesize  it. He is fair-minded and positive. He frequently presents noted Democrats  and other liberals in a favorable light.</P>  <P>	 Many Republicans cannot be thrilled, for example, that Gingrich dotes   on Alvin and Heidi Toffler, authors of &quot;The Third Wave.&quot;  Once  the noted literary couple get off the  familiar theme of the hunter-farming  society yielding to the Industrial Revolution, which  yields in turn to  the Information Revolution, they are given to expressing alarmist environmental  and social concerns that make conservatives gnash their teeth. On the night  before the recent presidential election, Gingrich's class on the role of  volunteers in American public life, carried nationally on Mind Extention  University cable tv, included generous tributes to former President Jimmy  Carter and to handicapped activist Max Cleland, even though Cleland was  on the ballot the next day as a Democratic candidate for the US Senate  in Georgia (he won).</P>  <P>	Maury Kennedy, a businessman who took the Gingrich course a couple  of years ago and now markets the tapes, complains of the ethics charges,  &quot;I manage this course every day of the week and I fail to see what  partisan political benefit he (Gingrich) or anyone else gets out of it.&quot;  The course is not a political recruiting device. About 7500 people subscribe  to a newsletter that follows the course themes.</P>  <P>	This confirms what I suspected all along. Gingrich is accused of using  this non-profit course and the colleges where he taught it on behalf of  his partisan objectives, specifically those of his action organization,  GOPAC. The reality is closer to the reverse: he initially  used GOPAC and  his political connections to start an academic course that refines his  philosophical and academic interests. But there is nothing morally wrong  with that. </P>  <P>	It often is on the side of their virtues rather than their vices that  politicians fail to guard themselves, which is how they fall into the kind  of procedural mistakes with which Gingrich's political opponents would  like to ensnare him now. Particularly when you are dealing with a politician  who also is an intellectual, it often is impossible to separate the man  of action from the man of ideas. From the standpoint of public interest,  it is an error to try too hard to do so. </P>  <P>	There is some danger that Gingrich's college course will be used as  an excuse to further restrict use of tax exempt educational moneys, a move  with potential to throttle, rather than improve, public discourse. It would  be wiser to broaden tax deductibility to include legitimate educational  research  conducted by parties and elected officials. Why should Republicans  and Democrats be denied the advantages enjoyed by the Chamber of Commerce  Foundation or the Sierra Club? Why this cute game where you can call something  &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; and it's okay with the  professional ethicists, but calling it &quot;Repubican&quot; or &quot;Democrat&quot;  makes it unacceptable?</P>  <P>	Newt Gingrich may have been careless as he moved his intellectual pursuits  from the political to the educational realm, and he was right to apologize  for that.  But his was the kind of minor failure you must tolerate in a  leader or sacrifice the First Amendment--which, above all, protects political  speech--and the capacity of representative government to function effectively.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Bruce Chapman, a former Secretary of State in Washington  State and a Reagan Administration official, is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

Discovery Institute Press Release August 10, 1996</H5>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

<H3><CENTER>Microsoft suddenly sees itself beset by broadband rebels and
its own middle age</CENTER>
</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
GOLIATH IN THE VALE of Elah roared his contempt at the weapons and zeal
of David: &quot;Do you think me a dog that you contest me with sticks and
stones?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, the Goliath of software, sees himself simi-larly beset by zealous
rivals with risible weapons. Entering his modest second-floor office on
the edge of the Microsoft campus on a twilight evening in late November,
I find him irked and addled by what he sees as a siege of slingshots from
irrational media and capital markets in his industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft entered November on an autumnal blaze of upside news-earnings
up 53%, sales up 63%, a double gi-gabuck quarter. But now, amazingly, people
were speaking of a &quot;crisis&quot; at Microsoft. &quot;That's an emotional
word,&quot; says Gates, twisting uncomfortably in his chair. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH when Netscape came on with 9,000 lines of code for a World
Wide Web browser that took six weeks to build and that was given away free,
and people began talking of his company's downfall. Gates had pulled that
trick himself in 1976, with a few thousand lines of code for the Basic programming
language for the PC and then again in 1980 with MS-DOS. But to do it to
Goliath seemed l&eacute;se-majest&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then comes Sun Microsystems with a new program-ming language called Java,
and people like me, who by Mi-crosoft standards don't know anything about
programming, who have never written a single line of code, presumed to tell
him about its virtues. It's safe, secure, interpreted, plat-form independent;
it collects your garbage (automatic garbage collection). It compiles as
if by incantation. It builds market cap as by magic. Give poor Bill a break.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Gates. &quot;I have to wonder who screwed
your head around....&quot; Oh, he knows, he knows. &quot;The In-ternet&quot;
makes everything different. You can make any claim you want, however bizarre
or ludicrous, that would ordi-narily be laughed off the stage, and if you
add the mantra &quot;on the Internet&quot; at the end you can morph yourself
from a typical media clown into a visionary, a prophet, a guru. &quot;Nobody
pauses to say, 'Huh?' &quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the analysts will nod and the market will bow. It's &quot;on the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One day in November, three days before my visit, Rick Sherlund, the Goldman
Sachs analyst who helped bring Microsoft public in 1986 and had touted the
stock for a decade, downgraded Microsoft's shares from buy to &quot;mod-erately
outperform&quot; on the basis of Internet incantations from Sun and Netscape.
Sherlund also replaced Microsoft with Netscape on his recommended list.
Indeed, Goliath's net worth was shrinking by the minute as Microsoft's mar-ket
cap sank by $9 billion, and Sun's and Netscape's surged by $9 billion in
a matter of weeks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does Bill Gates know Rick Sherlund, by any chance? Sure, Gates answers,
&quot;extremely well.&quot; &quot;He's your man, he's great,&quot; says
Gates, &quot;if you want to run a spreadsheet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this world of manias and emotions, &quot;I have to make rational decisions,&quot;
Gates says, glaring at me. &quot;Somebody who thinks that because of a browser
that anyone can clone, because of a language that is magic, they [Netscape
and Sun, the unmentionables] can overthrow the world-that person can't even
think two chess moves ahead. You're not even in the game I'm playing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, thinking forward a couple of moves, what is the big thing bearing
down on Microsoft on that road ahead? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's middle age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, in Redmond, they have another name for it. Throughout the company, wherever
you go-from hum-mus on pita bread at the cafeteria with a glib former Holly-wood
agent hired to handle publicity, to a Starbucks latte at the Microsoft model
&quot;home&quot; with software sage Rick Rashid incandescent on a couch,
or off to Rover's Restau-rant where Nathan Myhrvold spiels refulgently at
a cor-ner table through 12 courses of rococo &quot;fatware&quot; and my
two missed flights-the word is middleband. From the top down, Microsoft
is becoming a middleband company. <BR>
<BR>

Gates, Myhrvold, James Allchin, Craig Mundie- nearly anyone in Redmond will
step you through it. The future is not broadband, not narrow-band; it is
some middle way. It takes Excel and Word and Pow-erPoint presentation graphics
and multimedia CD-ROMs and the new Video ROMs-indeed all the front and back
Office suites that are the core of the company, all the teeming tow-ers
of legacy code-and attaches that to the Internet. It's Encarta and Baseball
and digital TV all tied to the Web over middle-band circuits. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates explains: &quot;We will translate Encarta into many lan-guages and
make it a front end to the Internet, so that when-ever you look up a topic
in the encyclopedia, we can link you into what there is in the Inter-net
on that topic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the Internet is not fast enough when you just want to go pure
Internet, so every year you can buy the CD that holds the bulk of the material.&quot;
It will be a middleband world. I see the millennium at hand: People are
all queu-ing up at Egghead for their Encarta update CDs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From Gates on down, however, Microsoft leaders do grasp the essence of the
change. Myhrvold trenchantly points out that communications standards no
longer rise from the center out, from the LAN to the WAN. They be-gin on
the Net and move inward to the LAN and transform it. &quot;The LAN is dead,&quot;
as Myhrvold says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these same Microsoft leaders seem to believe that the transforming power
of the Net stops short of the PC and operating system. Sun will set, but
Windows will open wide on the World Wide Web (up to ISDN speeds). After
all, as Allchin puts it, &quot;We see the Internet as an extension of the
operating system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask Gates how we can have a middleband world in the face of a rising tide
of bandwidth. Gates in the past has spo-ken of virtually &quot;infinite
bandwidth.&quot; But he does not see it today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty years from now we will have broadband in homes, he explains, but
until then middleband is the best you can expect. Indeed, in his presentation
to the press the week after my visit, on December 7, he strangely declared
&quot;broad-band is the holy grail, [but] it's much further away than ever
before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask about cable modems. But to Gates, cable modems are mere middleband:
&quot;Don't get me wrong-you can do a lot in middleband. But cable is a
shared medium. Cable modems are middleband. You get 10 megabits per second
and share it with 500 homes and you are back to ISDN speeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, I protest, Netscape has a different view. It has joined with @Home
(the Kleiner Perkins-TCI joint venture) to supply browsers and servers for
a new scalably broadband Internet based on cable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates's voice reaches a new pitch. &quot;I assure you Netscape has no relationship
with @Home that Microsoft does not have. I didn't spend three years talking
with John Malone for nothing three years with Bruce Ravenel [Tele-Communications
Technology Ventures' senior vice-president and chief operating officer].
In the first place, browsers are trivial. We will have cable browsers. And
we will have cable servers. We will do anything with @Home that Netscape
does.&quot; After all, TCI Technology Ventures invested $125 million in
MSN (Microsoft Network). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it went in the Redmond gloaming. I deeply admire Gates. The guts to leave
Harvard at the end of his junior year and launch a new industry; the tenacity
to build it into a planetary utility; the audacity and ingenuity of the
original deal with IBM; the entrepreneurial confidence to cut loose from
OS/2. The vision to be the only major software company to embrace Macintosh
and save Apple by en-dowing the Mac with the leading GUI spreadsheet and
word processor, Excel and Word, while at the same time gaining the graphics
skills to create Windows. The bold challenge to Unix through Windows NT.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that Gates has been the exemplary business leader of our
era. Compared with the leaders of IBM, heavy with &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here)
and degrees in business administration and finance, who could not even grasp
the concept of sunk costs or the rule of self-cannibalization well enough
to burke OS/2, who could not even see the huge opportunity to embrace the
Mac OS, Gates is indeed a giant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A week later, in an announcement emblazoned in Com-puterworld as &quot;Capitulation,&quot;
Gates showed his superiority to the NIH syndrome at IBM. He declared that
he was licensing Sun's Java Internet animation language, in which he seemed
suddenly to have discovered new virtues, and was essentially abandoning
Microsoft Network as a proprietary paid service. It would serve as an attractive
Inter-net entry point, open to all, with content and advertising prepared
with anyone's available software. Beyond that, Microsoft announced an array
of impressive-sounding new Internet products: Blackbird publication tools
for the Net; Gibraltar Internet server products four times as fast as Netscape's;
Visual Basic as a scripting language for the Net already far easier and
more familiar than Java; upgrades of current Word versions that allow direct
creation of HTML documents; and an array of other announcements. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But all the brave talk, the bestselling book, the stilted TV appearances,
the an-nouncement of a news channel with NBC, the stream of new products,
the bold embrace of an In-ternet strategy, the spread of Windows 95, could
not disguise the rising confu-sion in Redmond. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden, Gates seemed to have lost his bearings. The man who elbowed
aside an on-air Connie Chung as if she were a bothersome gnat and shunned
NBC as a nuisance, now was clutch-ing the old network, of all things, as
a source of news and investing in it, as if it had a future. It was as if
old NBC with its Max Headrooms of smiling anchor faces and two-minute splashes
of &quot;news&quot; could morph into an in-formation resource simply by
invoking the mantra &quot;on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in his long romance with Warren Buffett, Gates seemed to be reaching
out to old money, power and pres-tige to bolster his company as it whirled
in the vortex that he had described as the &quot;Internet tidal wave.&quot;
It was as if he no longer trusted the PC to sustain his growth as an $8
billion revenue company, as if he needed sustenance from mass media. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Netscape, Sun, @Home and other firms, Silicon Valley is in the ascendant
again. But the software colossus is still losing ground on the road ahead,
so Gates pivots on his peerless pinnacle simultaneously at the summit of
the New York Times bestseller list and the Forbes 400 and looks back with
a Macaulay Culkin smile from the cover of a book that is mostly news of
yesterday. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I N T E L   O U T S I D E ? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, back in Silicon Valley from the Vale of Elah, I visit Goliath's
prime mover, Andrew Grove of Intel. With revenues more than twice as large
as Micro-soft's and a price/earnings ratio less than half as high, and commanding
the world's most awesome manufactur-ing facilities for the world's most
complex and portentous product, Intel seems to stand on firmer foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove opens the meeting with jokes about the &quot;tunnel of death&quot;
that perpetually menaces his industry in the pages of the media. Ensconced
in a small open cubicle on the fifth floor of the Robert Noyce headquarters
in Santa Clara at the heart of Silicon Valley, with &quot;Intel Inside&quot;
inscribed on the roof to enlighten the planes from nearby San Jose In-ternational
Airport, Grove effervesces wit and irony and bonhomie where Gates seethed
sarcasm and defensiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Grove, there is no longing for canonization by old money, no sell-sign
craving for the sickly glamour of Hol-lywood and TV, no fashionable yearning
for business in &quot;content.&quot; Grove grasps that the PC is the ascendant
force in the global culture of capitalism and that the Internet consummates
the PC. Nonetheless, asked about the possibility of the teleputer-the $500
Internet PC-freed from the coils of Wintel, he echoes Gates in a cele-bration
of current PC culture that somehow misses the point. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove associates the teleputer with dumb or static appliances, from set-top
boxes to PDAs, in the catalog of PC sub-species that emerged in hype as
substitute PCs. Most of them sold a few hundred thousand units, and then
expired. &quot;The new device will be produced and it too will sell a few
hundred thousand units. But not 10 million units,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Forbes ASAP editor Rich Karlgaard and I prepare to leave his office,
he asks us to guess the cycle rate of the up-coming '96 basic home-based
PC. I suggest 100 megahertz. Grove shakes his head. He confides that he
is headed for a meeting to decide whether the 1996 PC will bear a 120- megahertz
or a 133-megahertz Pentium. &quot;Everyone un-derestimates the progress
of PCs,&quot; he says with satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could fix on a special-purpose device today, to satisfy Larry
Ellison's mother [who wants a simpler PC], but by the time it came out,
the PC will have moved on, powered by incomparably more potent microprocessors,
leaving the new machine trivialized and obsolete in its wake.&quot; In other
words, evolutionary products will suffice in this revolutionary time of
exponentially expanding Nets and peripheral CPUs. Nonetheless, moving a
few miles north on California's Route 101, out of the hypergravita-tional
fields of Philistea, one can still feel a radical shift-ing in the spheres
of possibility. &quot;And David took his staff in his hand and chose him
five smooth stones.&quot; I Samuel 17:40 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR THE NEW ORDER, the ultrawideband wireless Sand Hill slingshot-the capitalist
conjurer of the forces causing new sleeplessness in Seattle-is John Doerr
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Shunning Herb Allen's summits of
schmooze, where the entrepreneurial big-time is an &quot;au-dacious&quot;
investment in Coke or NBC, Doerr epitomizes the venture capitalist as industrial
demiurge. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As technology investor Roger McNamee puts it: &quot;While other venture
capitalists say, 'Let's start a company,' John says, 'Let's start an industry.'
&quot; So far, beginning at Intel in the early years, he has played a key
role in launching in-dustries in electronic design automation, RISC workstations,
personal computers, financial software, multimedia and wire-less pen appliances
(well, let that last one pass). His current new industry will be the biggest
yet. It is broadband Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From the vertiginous launch of Sun, Lotus and Compaq in the early 1980s
to a fund gush-ing Go at pens, his career has seen several peaks and valleys.
Doerr has even dallied with middle age. He once weighed a mid-life retreat
from the madding bustle of Silicon Val-ley to contemplate the Tantra or
the Tao: &quot;I sometimes think,&quot; Doerr told the New York Times in
1987, &quot;I would like to become a Buddhist monk.&quot; Sure, John. But,
tell me, what yoga discipline was he brewing two years ago in Palo Alto,
at breakfast at Il Fornaio head-to-head with Jim Clark? What karmic rites
was he conjuring with Clark and Bill Joy in the winter of 1994 on a three-hour
conference call among wildernesses of Marriott on the road? What karass
was he kenning in December 1994 among the tacky booths and bins, the barkers
and indoor bikinis at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim? What tables were
tipping in January 1995 in his Woodside home, among pizzas and pastas with
his wife, Anne, and Marc Andreessen, Bill Joy, Andy Bech-tolsheim, Jim Gosling
and Rick Schell (Netscape's VP of engineering)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why, in early 1995, was he lurking around the NASA Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif.? Is he seeking evidence of alien
IPOs, or just some hard-core Unix Christian libertarian netbender from outer
space to levitate a new industry in Palo Alto? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T venturer Thomas Judge told Forbes ASAP's Nancy Rutter in 1993:
&quot;You have to be on the fringes to make money in [Doerr's] business,
and that's where he is.&quot; Follow Doerr, however, from day to day, call
to call, from Sun to Oracle to America Online to Netscape to Macro-mind,
and you will find yourself at the fringes just as they invert into the Zen
center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A lean figure, with blondish hair, a cowlick and horn-rims, Doerr at 44
is as bashfully all-business and freneti-cally bitwise as Gates whom he
resembles, but he is still flouting the gravity of middle age. On a crisp
Sunday in mid-December, I catch up with him at Buck's restaurant, near his
home in Woodside in Silicon Valley. Wearing a dark suit from church, he
checks for messages on his Skytel pager, greets fellow venturer Bill Davidow
passing by and then opens a black briefcase full of technotoys. From across
the restaurant, this venture colossus looks to be a frowsy salesman perhaps
a little desperate to present his wares. He removes a Mac Power-Book 5300
and Sony speakers and lays them out on the table. Amid empty latte glasses
and plates of ravioli pesto and his own half-eaten hamburger, Doerr is ready
to give a demo of the new industry-a fore-cast for next year's Netscape-style
IPO. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a minute or so to boot up the Mac, checking through the 32 megabytes
of RAM (teleputers, Doerr says, will boot up instantly from flash ROM).
But from there on out, it is all immediate grati-fication. Click to ignite
a Java Web page with streaming stockmarket data, a c/net talking- head newscaster
and a vocano video from Venezuela. &quot;Wow, look at that new PowerBook
go,&quot; exults a jolly woman observing from the next table. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Doerr is on a rush through a world of his own. Click again and you have
the Sunnyvale Sun, efflorescent with vivid speech, sports clips and classified
personals. Newspapers will be hot on the broadband Internet. Click on the
classifieds and you can presumably meet their makers in living color. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a glimpse of @Home, a mere demo of Doerr's new broadband Internet
company. As the service develops you will soon be able to download movies
and other pro-grams on demand. Over 28.8 modems or even 128-kilobit-per-
second ISDN lines, all such dynamic fare would be ag-onizingly slow to access.
By contrast, Doerr says, in @Home everything is instant, full motion and
always on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How can this be, you ask, on an essentially middleband Internet? &quot;That's
the genius of Milo Medin, @Home's net-work chief,&quot; he explains, &quot;linked
to the genius of Marc An-dreessen of Netscape.&quot; NASA Ames's network
king, Medin is now building a scalable, extensible architecture for a cable-based
World Wide Web. With some help, I might add, from John Doerr and his five
smooth stones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
B R E A K I N G   W I N D O W S   A N D   B O T T L E N E C K S <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, four of the five companies-Sun, Netscape, Macromind and Intuit-Doerr
estimates, &quot;have added more than $10 billion to their market cap in
the last six months because of their Internet initiatives,&quot; this new
model of computing based on the Web, while Microsoft lost a similar total
by briefly resisting it. Now @Home is on target to generate another multibillion
market cap by exploding the current bandwidth bottlenecks of the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At Intel, Doerr worked at a desk down a corridor from Bruce Ravenel. Then
an architect of the 8086 and the 8087, Ravenel is now TCI Technology Ventures'
influential chief of technology. Igniting the fuse for @Home were words
between Doerr and Ravenel as the two old grads from &quot;Noyce-Moore U&quot;
wove their way through the Western Cable Show in the first week of December
1994. &quot;I dare not call it an epiphany,&quot; Doerr says, &quot;but
Bruce and I were at the Motorola booth where they were showing off a sleek
little $300 box the size of a modem that would enable telephone calls over
a cable line. 'What would it cost,' I asked, 'to add an Ethernet port to
the device, so you could link a computer to the Internet through it at up
to 10 megabits per sec-ond? ' When the Motorola guy guessed, 'Maybe $30,'
our eyes got as big as saucers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Doerr sees a hole in the line, he hits it hard and fast. Two weeks
later, four days before Christmas 1994, he was in John Malone's office in
Denver presenting a plan for a Silicon Valley startup to bring broadband
Internet over cable. Likely IPO market value in two years? $3 billion. Malone
also hits hard and fast. After a three-hour meeting, the TCI chief signed
off on the venture with-out a qualm. Doerr's chief job was to &quot;line
up some unique Silicon Valley technical genius to make it work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tapping Internet experts at Sun and around the Valley, Doerr found only
one name popping up on every list. It was that hard-core Unix Christian
libertarian netbender from outer space, Milo Medin. A 32-year-old wunderkind
manager of the multiple networks converging at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Medin had spent the last 12 years making increasingly
crucial contributions to the Internet's growth. But uh-oh. For a week or
more, Medin refused to answer any calls from Kleiner Perkins. He says, &quot;I
thought they were a bunch of lawyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DOERR WAS ATTACKING the key problem of the Internet. With the number of
host computers doubling every year since 1970 and the power of the computers
doubling every 18 months, the Internet had mastered every challenge of capacity
by multiplying cheap local routers and servers. The Net has already overtaken
the U.S. Postal Service as a carrier of mail (by one estimate, a trillion
e-mail messages compared with 180 billion postal deliveries). And the Net
similarly has pushed the number of digital data bits ahead of the total
of voice bits on the phone system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last two years, however, the traffic has taken a turn toward GIFs
and graphics, doubling the number of bits every few months. As the Internet
careens toward its destined collisions with television and telephony as
the prime sources of information, entertainment and commu-nication for the
public, the prime obstacle is bandwidth. Many in the industry have begun
to blink and bluster in the bright light of optical media and other broadband
pipes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Led by Bill Gates, they believe in middleband and ISDN. They dabble defen-sively
in TV. As a shared medium, even cable, so Gates contends, will dwin-dle
to ISDN rates as the number of customers on the system rises. But at 128-kilobit-per-sec-ond
or even at 1.54- megabit-per-second T1 rates, ISDN means picture quality
inferior to NTSC television. A shared medium linked to slow routers means
bottlenecks throughout the system if cable modems yield a thou-sandfold
increase in bit traffic beyond existing modems (up from 28.8 kilobits to
close to 30 megabits per second). On-line services will bog down in slow
access, sticky searches, jerky movement, blurred faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such a middleband net will not be able to maintain its current momentum
of growth and power. It will not be able to challenge television and telephony.
Yet the valuations of Internet companies depend on a continued exponential
ascent. Thus many people believe the Net is overhyped, overvalued, starved
for &quot;content.&quot; They believe Doerr's broadband revolution will
fail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Milo Medin is Doerr's weapon to break the bottleneck. He has spent most
of his adult life overcoming crises on the Net. Medin's fast rise began
in 1987 when he led the creation of NASA's Internet and almost came to an
end in 1993, when the swarthy Serb with the spruce mustache and the piping
voice and broadband gush had barged into Washington to persuade the entire
government to em-brace the Internet protocols (TCP/IP). Fueled by this uni-versal
language, the Net had grown exponentially up a wall of worry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problems did not reach critical mass until 1994, however, when its traffic
began doubling every couple of months. Andreessen's Mosaic browser had spurred
the World Wide Web into a multiterabyte cyclone of growth and expansion,
concentrated in California. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the entire Internet converged in one room in one building at Ames.
On one side of the room were the Cisco 7000 routers and Digital gigaswitches
and Northern Telecom add-drop multiplexers of the FIX (the Federal In-ternet
Exchange), the government peering-and-exchange point, managed mostly by
Medin. On the other side was MAE West, the Internet access exchange point
for most of the private Internet, including the pullulating college and
university Nets, the regnant Internet service providers such as ANS and
Sprint, and the budding local fiefdoms of Netcom and The Well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in April 1994, the government ended its $25 million in annual Internet
subsidies and arranged for a private takeover. Among the winning bidders
were Pac-Bell and Ameritech, assigned to run two key network ac-cess points
(NAPs). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long expecting the withdrawal of government subsi-dies to throw the Net
into chaos, many observers would welcome the ensuing crash. The private
sector would flub the job. There would be a tragedy of the commons. As in
feudal Britain, when the commonly owned lands were overgrazed and ruined,
the commonly owned Internet would suffer a glut of graphics &quot;GIFraff&quot;
and traffic jams. Sure enough it was happening. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PacBell's ATM switches from Newbridge Networks, with skimpy buffers designed
like a PBX for voice-traffic pat-terns, choked. California, the source of
two-fifths of In-ternet traffic, was down. The Western NAP jammed, and Ameritech's
Chicago NAP was also largely out of commis-sion. Bay Area e-mail from a
student on Netcom to a small business on BBN's BARNet had to steer clear
of the Ames hub and pinball through routers all the way across the country
to Sprint's NAPs in Pennsauken, N.J., or Reston, Va., and then all the way
back again. As a result, the Eastern Inter-net hubs also began to tilt.
An obvious solution seemed to be to have FIX West, the government hub at
Ames, take over the traf-fic that was fleeing the Pacific Bell NAP. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Savvy residents of Silicon Valley, the Ames management was sympathetic.
Then Medin gained the blessing of NSF networking chief Steve Wolff and enlisted
Jack Waters at MCI, a crucial Internet backbone supplier that no longer
used its PacBell connection. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Within two weeks, Medin created a system comparable in capacity and reliability
to the original FIX, with expanded Net management capabilities, power supplies,
communications ports and routing facilities. The result was a broadband
national peer-ing- and-exchange point, with a cumulative capacity of some
10 gigabits per second. It combined traffic from all the major commercial
Internet suppliers with the bitstreams from government laboratories and
agencies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, throughout this period of crisis and turbu-lence, no ordinary
Internet customer experienced any un-toward deterioration of service. Although
Medin's contri-bution was only part of a major national effort, he became
the talk of the Net. Doerr had to sign him up. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AS DOERR SUMS IT UP, &quot;Milo was running the largest IP net in the federal
government. When they decided to set up a White House.gov Web site, they
asked where to put it. They put it on Milo's server. Milo helped run the
fiber ring around Moscow. Internet connections for Australia and Antarctica
and for deep space probes ran through Milo. He was supplying IP connectivity
for the entire Scandinavian subcontinent. He had some 200 remote nodes.
And he ran it all with some 99.98% uptime.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
@Home CEO Will Hearst of Kleiner Perkins likes to tell a story that gives
some clues as to how this young Net nerd from NASA became a legend in his
own time: &quot;In 1988, a Finn-call him Lars-hacks his way into Milo's
comput-ers. Ticks Milo off. He does a trace route and finds his way back
to the administrator of the domain in Finland. It's an academic site. Milo
already knows Lars's IP address. You can't hide from Milo. He says to the
administrator, 'We have a problem. Please have a conversation with Lars.'
That upset the Finns, who say, 'We are not going to do that! We respect
civil liberties here! You can post a complaint if you like, but we can't
tell the guy what to do.' So Milo goes into a slow boil. Says, 'I'll give
you about 30 minutes to get that guy's files off our machine.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing happens. So Milo issues an order: 'Take down Scandinavia.'
The switch is pulled. Three countries go dark. They don't notice it immediately,
but pretty soon e-mail messages are not getting returned. At last, three
senior administrators go to Lars, so the story goes, and they say: 'We don't
care if you hack into the CIA; we don't care if you bring down NSA; and
we don't mind if you abscond with all the financial bits in the Federal
Reserve. But don't mess with Milo at NASA.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Finns called back Milo, said the situation had been taken care
of. Milo said fine and put the service back up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOW DOERR and Medin are again confronting the perennial doomsday adven-tists
who gather on mountaintops of slightly older money and disparage the future
of the Net, talking crisis, over-load, overhype, overvaluation. Tragedy
of the Commons. The experts are chiming in. From Howard Anderson of the
Yankee Group to Andrew Seybold and Bob Metcalfe, lead-ing analysts are prophesying
a crash in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin has been there before. The answer to traffic jams on a narrowband
Net is creation of a broadband Net. Don't tell him it is not technically
possible. Who are you kidding? This is the age of the telecosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, though, thinks it is the age of middleband. It is obvious beyond
cavil to Gates that his regime, ruling 80% of the world's computers, is
destined to prevail. He commands a market share so overwhelming that Wash-ington's
antitrusters see it as a monopoly in need of gov-ernment dissolution. For
Gates, among the most ludicrous claims to be validated by the mantra &quot;on
the Internet,&quot; is the idea that Windows machines are an inferior minority
system difficult to digest in the prevailing habitat of Unix and TCP/IP.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Medin, however, it is a matter of simple fact that Win-dows and NT are
awkward systems, hard to incorporate in his domains except as mere terminals.
To Medin, Unix is the heart of the Internet, the matrix of creativity in
net-working, the bearer of thousands of programs and services and tools
and scripts and languages that together comprise the pullulating fabric
of the rampantly growing Web. So far, Medin has a strong case. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sixty percent of the managers of Internet host comput-ers use Macintoshes
as their preferred personal machine. On the Internet, as a platform for
servers, whether for the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher or
NeWS, Microsoft's favored NT now ranks seventh, with a 4% share, behind
Sun, which commands a 56% share, Apple, Silicon Graphics, IBM, Digital Equip-ment
and Windows 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Around the time that Gates was assuring me of Microsoft's impregnable position
with @Home, Medin was reviewing the Seattle company's software concepts
for his new network. The @Home people wanted to adopt Microsoft's Explorer
browser if they could (TCI fa-vored its interactive TV ally), but it was
simply impossible. Explorer ran on neither Unix nor Macs, and could not
handle mul-ticasting. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's browser already worked with all the existing systems, including
the various Windows. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of Marc Andreessen, who had learned net-working in the
broadband 45- megabit-per-second environment of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Netscape had long ago left behind all
the comforts of middleband. Andreessen was eager for broadband con-nections.
Gates was not even in the game that Medin and Andreessen were playing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All right, suppose that &quot;browsers are a trivial tech-nology,&quot;
as Gates told me dismissively. It was servers that Microsoft really wanted
to sell to @Home. Their Gibral-tar system was running Microsoft's somewhat
balky inter-nal Internet at a pace some four times faster than Netscape's
server might. Here, Microsoft benefited from its homogeneous cam-pus environment.
Netscape had to employ the &quot;union&quot; code-using the lowest-common-denominator
instructions to coordinate several varieties of Unix, Mac and Windows NT.
Meanwhile, Microsoft could optimize Gibraltar for all the most powerful
instructions in Windows NT, so it was much faster. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the @Home people were perplexed. How could they use Windows NT, an alien
system on the Internet, unfa-miliar to their employees or to the Internet
service-provider personnel who would work the @Home headends and oth-er
nodes? Microsoft was behaving in the Internet environ-ment as if the company
were still safe in the imperial realms of Windows desktops. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So @Home, which promises to be the most important force in the next phase
of Internet evolution, and Medin, the intellectual firebrand at the heart
of @Home, seem un-likely to embrace Microsoft's offerings. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MILO'S DARK SHADOW OVER MICROSOFT <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As for TCI, its enthusiasm was dented a bit by the collapse of the MSN project,
in which Malone invested $125 mil-lion. But TCI has recouped its loss. Jim
Clark was persuaded to offer TCI a small share of the Netscape IPO. After
the initial public offering and the subsequent boom in Net-scape shares,
TCI's holding was worth $125 million, leav-ing TCI quite comfortable with
its new allies in Moun-tain View. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A deeper look at Medin's plans casts darker shadows in the path of Microsoft.
Asked about the notion of an Internet computer being free of Windows and
other Mi-crosoft levies, Gates stops rocking on his chair and gets to his
feet. He turns and paces urgently back and forth across his office. He gestic-ulates,
summons the history of past challenges, refers repeatedly to dumb termi-nals
and other unappetizing machines, and hurls forth rhetorical questions: &quot;Do
you want to go onto the Internet when you are doing word pro-cessing, do
you want to go on the Internet when you are using PowerPoint or Excel?&quot;
In other words, do you want to forgo all the wonderful new OLE interactions
among Microsoft programs and all the new Microsoft hot links and other forthcoming
tools when you go on the Net? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the pressure of Gates's energy and conviction and hypotheticals, I
answer, &quot;Of course not.&quot; But the real answer is, &quot;Sure, if
in exchange I can have a computer that outperforms a current Wintel machine
on the Net and con-tains linking capabilities comparable to OLE for one-third
the price.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates himself sketched out the answer in his famous In-ternet Tidal Wave
memo, issued in May to galvanize his company in the face of the new threat.
He pointed out that not only could he access far more information on the
In-ternet, he could also find, search and browse it more read-ily on the
Net than on a LAN or, for that matter, he might have pointed out, Gates's
own hard drive or CD-ROM. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The error of all the critics of the $500 teleputer is their assumption that
it will be inferior to current PCs. It will be, they claim, a PC minus a
fast CPU, short a high-reso-lution monitor, without a fast memory or large
drive. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This assumption misses the compounding impact of mi-crocosm and telecosm.
The advance of chip technology through Moore's Law, together with the advance
of net-work bandwidth, will endow a machine not inferior but hugely more
powerful, than the most supercharged Pentium workstation on a local-area
network linked to the Internet at ISDN speeds. The Law of the Microcosm
ordains that one-chip sys-tems will be better, not worse, than intersecting
boards strewn with devices linked by wires and buses. As Wilf Cor-rigan,
chief of LSI Logic, observes, &quot;From calculators to cellular phones,
every time a system has moved onto a sin-gle chip, it has wreaked havoc
with the existing industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IN PREPARING THE WAY for one-chip teleputers, Medin con-cedes that the current
Inter-net will not support broadband services. &quot;You link a broad-band
modem to the existing Internet and what you get is an impedance mismatch&quot;-a
bunch of fire hoses attached to a network of garden hoses. In order to accommodate
the fire hoses of @Home, Medin will have to enlarge the band-width of the
Net, from the humblest service provider to the NAPs at the top of the net-work
hierarchy, where the leading service providers join to &quot;peer and exchange&quot;
data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leasing capacity from the telephone companies, @Home will create a new broadband
network linking to the existing NAPs at MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
at the Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, N.J., and at MAE West in Mountain View.
This will expand the capacity of the so-called Internet back-bone (in fact,
an ever-shifting array of virtual vertebrae), which currently works with
maximum pipes running at 45 megabits per second. Over the next two years,
Medin plans to upgrade his backbone to 622 megabits a second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important and revolutionary, though, are Medin's plans for the local
loops and service providers of the Net. Contrary to the claims of many critics
that the Internet PC implies a return to the now-discredited model of the
main-frame and dumb terminals, @Home resolutely distributes intelligence
and memory through the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the @Home system is ingenious hierar-chical memory management
and caching to conceal the mazes of slow routers, sluggish switches and
narrowband wires that lurk treacherously among the higher reaches of the
Internet. Indeed, when Doerr finally got through to Medin and, with Will
Hearst, first proposed cable modems to him, he said they wouldn't work.
There would be &quot;im-pedance mismatches&quot; with the hardware and software
in the rest of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of blew the air out of their tires,&quot; says Medin. &quot;But
then I told them how the system could work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to think of it as a distributed computer sys-tem. In such
systems, every processor cannot access memory at once. You build caches
and shared-memory pro-tocols and you mirror and replicate a lot of the data
so that it's always available locally. That's what you're going to have
to do on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the Internet is a computer on a plan-et. Like a computer
on a chip, its raw bandwidth cannot handle the necessary throughput. Thus
its communica-tions depend on ingenious hierarchical memory manage-ment,
with registers, buffers, latches, caches and direct-memory access controllers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Studies of Internet use show that some 80% of the traffic is still local.
If a particular Web page is popular in a particular locality, you have to
have that page in the hard drive or even in RAM on a local server. You have
to use the multicast ca-pabilities of cable to broadcast popular information
to all ad-dresses. Above all, you have to make the system scalable. You
have to phase in bandwidth, moving fiber links and nodes deeper into neighborhoods
as demand rises. All this is per-fectly possible technically, Medin assured
Doerr. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After I was through, they decided they had to hire me. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still thought we would have to build all the software ourselves.
I didn't know Netscape was thinking the same way. But I went down to Netscape
and got together with Marc Andreessen, who is a friend, and we had a real
mind-meld on all this stuff. They were doing the software already. Netscape
became our main software partner. It turned out that their browser is de-signed
for multicast. And their proxy server is great for caching information and
delivering it to users on demand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin thinks that a key to making the system work is to distribute lots
of cache through all the local points of presence. With this kind of network,
the teleputer might become not only far cheaper but also far superior to
today's PC. A now famous Gartner Group study shows that the average office
PC costs $40,000 over five years when you factor in software and network
maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 75% of cumulative PC costs now come from staff support. @Home will
supply tech support, mainte-nance and storage more efficiently, whether
centrally by phone or at local headends. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a glimpse of the future, visit Boston College, where cable modems supplied
by Continental Cablevision are already becoming &quot;addictive&quot; to
many students and professors. On the basis of this experience, Forrester
Re-search is now predicting sales of some 7 million cable modems by the
turn of the century. Medin thinks this es-timate is conservative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With cable modems you will come to demand wireless connectivity throughout
your home or small office, so that your teleputers can link to the Net wherever
they are with-out plugging them in to a connector or dialing up a connection.
Only cable can accomodate such demands. &quot;Internet PCs fit with @Home
like ice cream and hot fudge,&quot; sums up Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the big question: Is it possible to build such a machine? &quot;Sure
it is,&quot; says Medin. &quot;Just take a Sony PlayStation, essentially
based on a one-chip ASIC, and re-place the CD-ROM connec-tor with an Ethernet
adapter. You'll get 3D graphics, Dol-by III sound, a 30-megahertz CPU controller,
a memory-access controller, and a 10-megabit-per-second 10BaseT link to
your cable headend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C O N S T E R N A T I O N    I N S I D E    I N T E L <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the new paradigm be-gins to threaten the cause and complacency not
only of Bill Gates but also of the other master of Wintel, Andy Grove. When
I ask him about such an ASIC so-lution to the problem of the $500 PC, consternation
breaks briefly through the surface of his bonhomie. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He snaps: &quot;I won't comment on the fantasies of Brian Halla,&quot; the
former Intel manager now executive vice-president of product marketing at
LSI Logic. Yet LSI Logic offers precisely Medin's PlayStation so-lution
to the problem of cheap teleputers, free of Wintel code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LSI Logic is the supplier of the workhorse chip for the PlayStation. Using
some 2 million transistors, this integrated chip combines a 30- megahertz
Silicon Graphics MIPS processor, a 60-MIPS geometry transfer engine, a direct-mem-ory
access unit, and Sony's proprietary MDEC device (for hybrid MPEG and JPEG
decompression) for full-screen video playback. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a Netstation, the MDEC would be replaced with the appropriate decompression
engines, and added to those would be Reed-Solomon and Viterbi error correction
to-gether with a cable modem module that receives 64-QAM signals and sends
QPSK. Based on its experience with the PlayStation chip, which LSI Logic
will be producing in volume on the world's first commercial 0.25-micron
fab-rication lines, LSI Logic estimates that it could sell a tele-puter
on a chip for around $50 in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This machine is the consummation of a long LSI Logic strategy. In the mid-1980s,
the company suffered a serious crisis as NEC, Fujitsu and Toshiba all opened
fast-turnaround design centers in the U.S. to deliver high-speed, high-density
gate arrays. At the same time, LSI launched a spinoff, Headland Tech-nology,
to make chipsets for PCs in competition with Chips &amp; Technologies and
VLSI Technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Supporting Headland,&quot; says Halla, &quot;was like walk-ing around
with an open artery. Intel remorselessly sucks out all the margins in PC
hardware.&quot; Chastened by the Japanese in gate ar-rays, LSI learned from
Grove not to take on Intel in PC markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To a company special-izing in gate arrays and chipsets, these lessons were
not inspiring. Then Wilf Corrigan, LSI's salty founder and CEO-a Silicon
Valley legend from Liverpool who previously played key roles at Fairchild
and Motorola-underwent a triple bypass. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People talked of retiring him, giving him a title with a new consortium,
U.S. Memories, where he might have learned not to compete with the Koreans
in DRAMs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after surgery, however, Corrigan returned to work at LSI and developed
a new strategy that would transcend the strategies of both Intel and the
Japanese. Under the new plan, LSI built state-of-the-art fabrication facilities
and design tools that could enable creation of a software library of &quot;Core-Ware.&quot;
CoreWare programs would generate a large variety of key functions, from
CPU kernels to signal processors and graphics engines, that could be deployed
in weeks on single special-purpose chips tailored to high-volume applications
mostly outside the Wintel ambit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By 1995, this strategy was bearing rich fruit. The com-pany announced it
had developed a fab process that could place some 49 million transistors
on a single sliver of silicon some 200 millimeters square. LSI released
a series of bellwether high-volume devices that moved the company beyond
the path of the PC, out into the network and into the consumer appliance.
The Sony PlayStation chip ran 1995's most successful CD game machine. LSI's
MPEG-2 decoder will go in the next version of RCA-Thomson's hugely successful
direct-broadcast satellite receiver. LSI also sup-plied the first ATM segmentation
and reassembly chip for several key equipment companies, and the first 100-megabit
switched-Ethernet solution for a fast Ethernet pioneer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking beyond Intel, this experience led Corrigan and Halla to conclude
that their company commanded all the crucial CoreWare ready to deploy a
teleputer on a single device manufacturable in volume for about $50. Attesting
that Halla's view is not fantasy is the success of the Sony PlayStation,
now on sale for $299, leaving room to buy a monitor and still stay under
$500. LSI also has several as-yet-unannounced design wins for cable modem
chips aimed at the markets to be opened by @Home. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel's response to such capabilities is its currently embattled program
for native signal processing. NSP allows software implementation of real-time
functions performed in special-purpose hardware under the &quot;CoreWare&quot;
model. As Grove points out, DSPs and com-pression chips may be getting cheaper
all the time, but from Indeo video to Proshare teleconferencing to Intel's
new Vertical Blanking Interval webware, NSP comes free of charge-if you
are already buying a Pentium (and you prob-ably are). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But no sooner will the CPU suck in another real-time role than a new virtual
temptation will glimmer on the hori-zon. For reaching the ever-receding
real-time goals-from continuous speech recognition to 3D rendering-the Core-Ware
approach will prevail, at least until the arrival of the new super broadband
mediaprocessors from MicroUnity and other Silicon Valley firms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS on these far frontiers of tech-nology, John Doerr
will launch his five smooth stones as the foundation for a new industry.
With Intuit leading the move to Internet financial services, Netscape pioneering
Internet software, Macromind supplying the authoring tools for multimedia,
@Home providing the bandwidth and Sun offering Java and UltraSPARC, the
entente is on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps Doerr's most important stone is Sun. Asked to name the key influences
in TCI's shift toward the Net, John Malone mentions Doerr first, hesitates
and then stress-es the role of Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.
Relentlessly, year after year, McNealy would travel to Denver and give his
pitch to Malone: Buy sets of Sun servers and link them to your headends
in order to supply data services. At first Malone resisted. &quot;Two-way
data,&quot; he used to say, &quot;is not a business that I want to be in.&quot;
But as the Internet grew, McNealy's argument gained new force. In late 1994,
it triumphed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Malone now believes that two-way broadband com-munications is the heart
of his business. For a total in-vestment of less than $188 million, Doerr
claims @Home can launch a business yielding at least $500 million in cu-mulative
revenues by the year 2000. Later this year, the Sunnyvale system will be
up and running. Weeks later, depending on cooperation from other cable companies,
the entire state of Con-necticut will move onto broadband two-way cable.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that point, all the other cable companies will accelerate their dri-ve
to upgrade their facilities to ac-commodate the gold rush. By the turn of
the century, @Home hopes to extend service to all the major urban and suburban
centers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Sprint, TCI leads a cable group that is paying $2 billion for wireless
personal communications service (PCS) spectrum across the country. Through
New York-based Teleport Communications and other bypass providers, TCI and
other cable firms already command fiber-optic rings through most major metropolitan
areas. With cable providing broadband backhaul for PCS, @Home's founders
think the company will emerge as the backbone for a full-service digital
communications network, including high-resolution teleconferencing, on-demand
films and other pay-per-view video, local news and school listings, classi-fied
advertisements, World Wide Web resources, and mul-timedia programming. TCI
itself is furiously upgrading and streamlining all its billing systems to
accommodate this rich transactional environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Z E R O   M A R G I N A L    M A G I C <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, as Nathan Myhrvold ex-plains, is the extension of
the computer model of flat-rate pricing into the field of communications.
When you buy a PC, you purchase its MIPS and bits essentially at a flat
rate. The average cost per MIP or bit of memory you use is de-termined by
how much you use the machine. The marginal cost is zero. As a result, people
have a powerful incentive to use computers as intensively and creatively
as possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This flat-rate pricing effect-where incremental costs are essentially zero-largely
explains the huge success of the general-purpose PC and the companies supplying
it with software and peripherals. Faced with a zero marginal cost of incremental
use, PC owners channel as much of their information processing, education
and entertainment as possible through the PC. Flat-rate pricing makes the
PC a dire threat to all contiguous industries and related functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, on the Internet model, you will pay a flat rate for bandwidth.
Again marginal costs will be zero. Average cost will respond to the extent
of usage rather than to a Public Utilities Commission tariff or some per-minute
charge. As Myhrvold points out, this approach will give you a tremendous
incentive to exploit bandwidth as fully as you can, channeling as much communication
as possible away from systems that charge incrementally and toward flat-rate
systems. In the end, nearly all communications will gravitate toward the
Internet model, and companies will prosper to the extent that they can ally
themselves with this tremendous force of creativity and economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Myhrvold now says that bandwidth is growing at the same pace as Moore's
Law. Gates, too, though long alert to the effects of exponentials in semiconductors,
is strange-ly blind to the faster trajec-tory of communications. He finds
the Internet a big sur-prise: &quot;Who predicted it?&quot; he asks. &quot;Let's
find the guy and make him king.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But by any measure- nodes, total bandwidth, traf-fic- the Internet has been
dou-bling every year since 1970, and many people have pre-dicted that it
would come to dominate communications. I prophesied in 1989 that it would
usurp television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I believe the band-width tidal wave will sweep away the notions of
Gates and Myhrvold of a smooth middleband transition for Microsoft and its
boob-tube collaborators. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Increasingly released from regulatory restrictions, band-width is now expanding
far faster than MIPS and bits (see <I>Forbes ASAP</I>, &quot;The Bandwidth
Tidal Wave,&quot; Dec. 5, 1994). Over the next five years, for example,
@Home will increase the bandwidth to home- and small-business computers
by a factor of thousands. While Moore's Law doubles com-puter power every
18 months, the law of the telecosm, by the most conservative possible measure,
doubles total band-width every 12 months. This adds up. Over the next decade,
computers will im-prove a hundredfold while bandwidth will expand a thou-sandfold.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this year, the computer and software industries have drafted behind
Moore's Law, while hiding behind what Roger McNamee has dubbed &quot;Moron's
Law&quot;-the telecom regulations that stifle bandwidth expansion. The industry
thus has thrived by employing MIPS and bits as a replacement for bandwidth
by using compression, de-compression, switching speed, and logic circuitry
to make up for the constrained bandwidth of public networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove capped off this tradition in early October, in a memorable keynote
address, following South African pres-ident Nelson Mandela to the podium,
at the Telecom 95 quadrennial exposition in Geneva. Grove wowed the large
audience of telco potentates with an on-stage real-time demonstration of
Intel's Proshare teleconferencing tech-nology. And yet, what chiefly struck
the viewer was the mediocrity of the partial-screen facial images. They
were far lower in resolution than ordinary television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as the pictures are inferior to TV images, PC teleconferencing will
remain chiefly a niche or a stunt. As bandwidth expands powerful-ly over
the next decade, it will seem increasingly perverse to substitute processing
for band-width, and more and more inviting to substitute band-width for
processing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The logic of MIPS and bandwidth works both ways. Not only can processing
make up for bandwidth, but bandwidth, as Claude Shan-non pointed out in
1948, can serve as a substitute for switching and other comput-er functions.
With bandwidth now expanding faster than processing speeds, new ar-chitectures
will prevail by substituting bandwidth for MIPS and bits. Today, the bulk
of bandwidth to homes is coaxial cable laid over the last 25 years by the
cable tele-vision industry. Exploiting that bandwidth for the Inter-net
is the single greatest opportunity in the history of in-formation technology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HAVING ASCERTAINED that Doerr had been meeting reg-ularly with all the pioneers
of the new paradigm that Andreessen was &quot;mind-melding&quot; with Medin,
and that Mal-one had been consulting with Doerr and McNealy, I ask McNealy
whether he has talked to Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he answers, &quot;I have not talked with Medin at all ...
since lunch on Wednesday. But back then he and I had sore necks from basically
agreeing with what the other was saying. We're fighting like crazy to become
the standard platform for Medin's environment. Our companies are in-credibly
well aligned. We have a list of about 12 engineering efforts that we are
undertaking and driving at Medin's request. The power of a network comes
from the number of nodes times the bandwidth. By this measure, the @Home
opportunity is as big as there is.&quot; McNealy revealed that the day before
in his office at Sun, he saw the demo of &quot;a diskless, CD-less, floppyless,
OS-less computer, and it was great. It had just about every bus, serial
and parallel and S-bus, and every kind of interface you can imagine. With
connectors on all four sides, it was a model for what I call a zero-administration
client. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Consider: If you give a user a disk drive, a CD, a floppy, an OS and
16 megabytes of memory, you have made him, whether he wants it or not, a
system administrator. He has so many resources to manage. What they showed
me yesterday was a virtual machine written in Java, and it booted up instantly
off flash ROM and ran like crazy be-cause the virtual machine rides so close
on the hardware.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Echoing Medin and Corrigan, McNealy evoked the future of the teleputer:
&quot;Put a touch screen on it and make it a kiosk, put a large screen on
it and make it a worksta-tion, put in an infrared detector and make it a
set-top box, put a joystick on it and make a game machine, put a cable modem
or an ISDN port on it and make it a PC or a digital phone. You never run
out of disk space; you never have to back it up; it's mirrored so you never
lose your files. You have an uninterruptible power supply. Your phone or
cable line is much more reliable than your hard drive on your PC. You get
used to the security of the system with no disks to corrupt and with Java
programs that execute only in a virtual machine and cannot invade your system.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
McNealy might have added, in ecumenical concern for Larry Ellison's mother,
&quot;Put in some Oracle code and you have a terrific, cheap database client
in an emerging world of far-flung databases.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the participants in the new regime agree. Combined with a broadband
network, the teleputer will be more flex-ible and powerful than existing
PCs. Rolling out both the network and the teleputer will be the central
activity in the industry over the next two years. Responding to it will
be the principal challenge to Gates and Grove, and possibly a route of redemption
for their companies. All the leading figures in this Silicon Valley renaissance
have endured recent periods of trial and failure. Malone suf-fered the collapse
of his Bell Atlantic merger in 1994 and the long stagnation of his stock.
Corrigan suffered physical collapse and the slump of his company. McNealy
endured a long tunnel of shrinking market share as his SuperSPARC processor
proved too complex to keep pace with rivals. Clark of Netscape lost influence
at Silicon Graphics, the company he had founded, and finally had to leave
in order to retain his self-respect. Even Doerr lost his touch for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Bill Gates, however, business life has been an al-most unrelenting ascent
toward riches untold for one so young. In the end, his success has made
him seem a bionic business leader leached of his humanity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His company has appeared to government and to competitors alike as a monopoly
threat, targeting existing rivals and systematically suppressing them, rather
than creating new products and industries. Much the same is said of Intel.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps this is the time for the Wintel team to face a domestic challenge.
From it they may well emerge stronger. Without them, it is clear, the Internet
will be weaker. Only from the crucible of competition between paradigms
can emerge a robust and redemptive new economy of information. <BR>

<BR>
Well, it had to happen. As the Internet emerges as the central nervous system
of global capitalism, the Luddite left is bursting into &quot;flames&quot;
against the microcosm and telecosm, against interlinked computers and the
global radiance of electromagnetic communications. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This rising resistance resonates with the press coverage that has long lavished
attention on the excesses of the Net. Richard Shaffer of the Computer Letter
counts 39,158 Internet stories during the first three quarters of 1995,
beating O.J. by some 15,000 citations. Much of the coverage has been lurid.
For psychedelic visions of virtual reality, the media have exalted Jaron
Lanier in dreadlocks and bankruptcy above Bob Metcalfe, creator of Ethernet,
or Gordon Moore, inventor of IC processing, or Charles Kao, father of fiber
optics, all of whom reshaped the boundaries of human possibility. Computer
viruses and Net porn win headlines and magazine covers that elude the creators
of vast new computer powers, such as RSA encryption or the World Wide Web
or new tools of chip fabrication at the quarter-micron level. Last August,
Windows 95, a modest advance in operating systems, exploded across the press
and the airwaves as if the entire media had been preempted for a Microsoft
infomercial. No wonder befuddled academics, politicians and book publishers
gain a grotesquely distorted view of the industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Tom Peters's first Forbes ASAP interview (March 29, 1993), he predicted
that the '90s would see a fabulous unfolding of new technology, accompanied
with increasing outbreaks of technophobia, Ludditism and Marxism. Alvin
Toffler greeted the initial readers of Wired with a similar dual prophecy
of networked marvels, foiled by a multifront war against the Third Wave.
Once again, Peters and Toffler may well be right, as from Hollywood to Harvard,
America's brainlords rebel against computer technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his pungent new book War of the Worlds, Mark Slouka joins the rising
chorus of resistance. Slouka finds it all a &quot;kind of lie.&quot; Like
a &quot;speech of Ronald Reagan&quot; or a spiritual vision from the &quot;religious
right,&quot; the virtual world is increasingly usurping reality and identity
itself. &quot;Rather than doing away with the couch potato, the telecomputer
has actually created a new, more tenacious variety of tuber: the individual
who swivels from the television screen to computer monitor without missing
a beat . . . .&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, Sandra Bullock writhes in anguish in the sinister clutches of The
Net, with a blond, predatory, arachnoid Bill Gates (using &quot;Gateway&quot;
software) masterminding the Web. Similar chimeras recur in antitech crusades.
Bathed in the ultraviolet frequencies of sunlight, humans throughout the
history of the species have raced through a planetary magnetic field of
half a gauss in power on a terrestrial sphere charged by worldwide lightning
strikes a hundred times a second to a capacitive level of 100 volts per
meter of height. Yet Paul Brodeur and other electrophobes panic at power
lines, power plants, cathode-ray tubes, microprocessors, cellular antennas
and other high-tech oscillators with an impact on humans measurable only
in millionths of a gauss. They defy the fact that around the world use of
electricity correlates almost perfectly with greater longevity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, despite the higher longevity and the globally spreading jobs
and riches springing from high technology, pseudoeconomists prattle endlessly
about the growing gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; Publishers sign up other disgruntled nerds to write hymns to
noble savagery and gardening. And from the fever swamps, a Marxist enrage
posts bombs through the mail and addled editors detonate them in the pages
of the Washington Post. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such fears and fantasies have always afflicted the course of human innovation
and progress. With life expectancies rising eight years in the developed
countries and 22 years in the Third World since 1950, people have more time
to lash out at industrial benefactors who gain wealth and create it from
sources hard to comprehend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Misconceptions about the Internet, however, also abound in more savvy circles.
From Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference to the Internet Society, serious
critics are emerging to predict that the network itself will bog down and
degrade, jammed by traffic and trivia. Often unconsciously, these critics
feed upon a spurious vision of capitalist ecology. Constantly recycling
Garrett Hardin's &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; as a theory of the
Internet, writers such as Clifford Stoll in Silicon Snake Oil, and others
from publications such as the New York Times to the National Review and
the Atlantic, predict that the Web, as a public good, will be overgrazed,
like the commonly owned fields of feudal Britain. Each herdsman or entrepreneur
gains from adding to his herd or bandwidth, beating rivals to the remaining
grass or spectrum, until congestion ruins the common space. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the epitome of a capitalist commons, the Internet, according to the critics'
predictions, will collapse under the impact of this law, clogged with traffic
and polluted with porn and violence. As a precursor, the same writers cite
citizens band radio, an earlier fad that rose meteorically and collapsed
ignominiously when, as they see it, millions of middle- and lower-class
hoi polloi rushed in and polluted the bandwidth without renewing it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the resistance converges many streams of reaction. In general,
the &quot;humanist&quot; opponents mistake the Internet for a continuation
of television technology. Thus they ascribe to the Internet the very flaws
that they find in TV -- crudeness, violence, porn, entertainment for &quot;diverting
ourselves to death&quot; -- and extend to the computer the old and mostly
valid arguments of Neil Postman and Jerry Mander against the idiot box.
Some of the other critics of the Internet benefit from TV and fear the Web
will replace their familiar tube. The executives of media companies are
mostly baffled by the new technology. Paralyzed by market research, as Jim
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape puts it, &quot;They are trying to build bridges
by counting the swimmers.&quot; A Washington lobbyist for a long-distance
carrier wonders poignantly if &quot;America is ready for all this bandwidth.&quot;
Baby Bells spurn the Internet to fund Hollywood films and TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blinded by the robber-baron image assigned in U.S. history courses to the
heroic builders of American capitalism, many critics see Bill Gates as a
menacing monopolist. They mistake for greed the gargantuan tenacity of Microsoft
as it struggles to assure the compatibility of its standard with tens of
thousands of applications and peripherals over generations of dynamically
changing technology (avoiding the dialectical babel of the more open Unix,
for example). They see the Internet as another arena likely to be dominated
by Microsoft and a few giant media companies, increasing the wealth of Wall
Street at the expense of the stultified masses of consumers and opening
an ever-greater gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Focused on the summits of the industry -- CEO s&eacute;ances among media
conglomerates and software kings -- all the critics can foster the impression
that the Internet is a questionable, unpromising venue, vulnerable to monopoly
and trash, thereby vindicating the Luddites and the Cassandras. From the
beginning of its civilian eruption, however (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The
Issaquah Miracle,&quot; June 7, 1993), the Net has risen from the bottom
up rather than from the top down; by nature, it is a heterarchy rather than
a hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To get a view of the future of the Net, let us turn aside from Herb Allen's
golfing groves and Bill Gates's mansion and Louis Gerstner's &quot;net-centric&quot;
revelation, and visit some of the fertile bottomlands where the Web is growing
fastest. Here no robber barons or monopolists come into view and there are
no signs at all of an impending slide toward tragedy and decline. Here the
negative externalities of the degraded commons fall before the huge positive
externalities of Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law, the microcosm and the telecosm,
where smaller transistors yield exponentially more efficient machines and
the value of networks rises by the square of the power of all the computers
attached to them. Governing the positive externalities of the Internet is
the convergence of these forces, compounded by the creativity of entrepreneurs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps such a combinatorial explosion explains the mind of Avi Freedman
of Net Access. Among the vanguard of the armies of the Internet, Freedman
is a classic American entrepreneur, entirely alien to the megalithic visions
of the critics. As an Internet service provider (ISP), Freedman supplies
the Philadelphia area with access to the goods and services of this global
ganglion of networks at a flat rate of between $12.50 and $20 per month,
depending on the services chosen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access still operates chiefly out of his cellar in a marginally middle-class
suburb of Wyndmoor. The street bristles with wires, transformer nodes, terminal
boxes and power lines, many of them converging on the duplex red-brick bungalow
where Freedman lives with his wife in an apartment above a basement crammed
floor-to-ceiling with multiplying racks of electromagnetic conversion and
processing gear for computers and telecom. These technologies are all oscillating
and radiating like crazy in the spirit of their hyperkinetic owner, who
is multiplexing Internet insights between his cellular phone and an attentive
audience of aspiring ISPs from western Pennsylvania and geek students visiting
from the University of Pennsylvania, gathered at his door next to the power-line
link. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this an entrepreneurial dream, or a carcinogenic nightmare out of the
muddled pages of Paul Brodeur? Avi is too busy to give the issue much thought.
Extending business service to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago,
overflowing his basement, he is now moving his operations to a collocation
cage at the Philadelphia central office of MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
where he has just turned up a T-3 fiber circuit (45 megabits per second)
direct to MAE East, the major East Coast Internet exchange point. From Seattle
to San Jose, top companies are besieging him with multimillion-dollar buyout
offers, but looking to the future and its promise, Freedman calculates that
he can't afford to sell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 4,000 customers, however, Net Access hardly seems to pose a threat
to such local colossi as Bell Atlantic and Comcast, now searching the world
for &quot;content&quot; opportunities and looming ever larger on Rodeo Drive.
Yet Ray Smith and Brian Roberts should pay attention to what is going on
in Freedman's teeming mind and basement. Millions of PC owners may well
become part-time Internet service providers in the future -- as their home
and small-business PCs supply content for others, perhaps beginning with
teleconferencing and telecommuting activities that will soon dwarf Hollywood
in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the students hanging on Freedman's words, for example, is Meng-Weng
Wong, whose personal Web page at Penn attracts some 35,000 hits a week with
its restaurant reviews, film criticisms, Philadelphia maps, technology insights
and other delectations. Drawing wide media attention, from Forbes ASAP to
Scandinavian TV (a crew is visiting this very day from the Netherlands),
Wong has now established a server at Net Access, pobox.com, which supplies
his clients with a permanent Internet address wherever they may go, and
he is developing a Web-page design business. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the onrush of innovative customers like Wong, the configuration
of Freedman's bottom-up operations offers clues to the future shape of the
industry. A portly, perspiring, blond, balding geek-genius bursting with
monologic humor and street smarts -- hardly full-duplex (scant signs of
upstream flow) -- Freedman has just hustled past his 26th birthday. He has
been deep in computers since age eight, when a prescient uncle gave him
a book on the Basic programming language at a Seder. Within months he was
entrenched among the information rich, opening an unbridgeable gap in computer
savvy between himself and nearly all of the other five billion inhabitants
of the planet. If you think you are going to catch up, forget it. By the
age of 12, in 1982, he was an active user of e-mail and Usenet news and
familiar with the abstruse command codes of the Unix operating system that
ran on his father's DEC PDP-11. Freedman senior, a pulmonary physician,
inherited the machine indirectly from Bell Labs, where it had been employed
as a Usenet news hub until displaced by a VAX. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986, still a teenager, Freedman began exploring the uses of Unix machines
for commercial databases and discovered to his surprise that serious businessmen
would give him gouts of money to get help with their computers. Eventually,
he was earning &quot;lawyers' rates&quot; (his mother is a Philadelphia
tax attorney) for work he found &quot;amazingly routine&quot; and &quot;even
fun.&quot; Nonetheless, after high school, his parents sent him off to college
in Massachusetts, where his computer skills were underappreciated. He returned
after a few weeks to get a job at the National Software Testing Labs in
the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken before enlisting at nearby Temple
University, which he chose because it offered more freedom for computer
experiments and consulting work than the more prestigious Penn a few miles
away. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After arriving, he discovered that Temple's computer lab also commanded
a superb resource: bandwidth, in the form of a nearly empty T-1 line linking
to the Internet at 1.544 megabits per second. Already computer rich, he
was becoming communications rich as well. In Avi Freedman, Temple's department
of computer science got rather more than it bargained for. Realizing that
the available PCs were network hostile and the lab's MicroVAXes ran VMS
rather than Unix, Freedman used his savings to buy five secondhand Sun 3
workstations for $600 apiece. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short order, Freedman began his career as an Internet service provider
and &quot;professional geek,&quot; albeit unpaid. Soon he had some 100 students
as users, mostly cavorting through games of Multiuser Dungeons (MUD). Temple's
address, supplied by Freedman -- bigboy.cis.temple.edu -- became known far
and wide as a hive of MUD activity. Temple's computer science professors
began to rebel at this untoward distinction, particularly when they found
that lost in the crypts and catacombs of the Net, their charges were virtually
unreachable for assignments in higher-level languages. Freedman was forced
to close down local access to the game portions of the server during daytime
hours. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman has given some thought to the problem of &quot;how to civilize
young, intelligent teenage males.&quot; He concludes, &quot;You have got
to get them interested.&quot; He says the students playing MUD at least
were learning Unix commands, &quot;a better way to get a job than mastering
the Pascal programming language,&quot; which was then being taught in the
regular classes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a student, working with Prof. Yuan Shi and other Temple professors, Freedman
developed a toolkit for distributed processing on Suns and presented a paper
in London in 1989 at a conference on computer-aided software engineering.
As his time at Temple drew to a close, he began contemplating graduate school.
&quot;Everyone was very surprised that anyone who could do anything on the
outside was going to graduate school,&quot; he says, &quot;but Stony Brook
on Long Island offered me a nice job as a research assistant in the lab
and I went up there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After graduating from Temple, Freedman also encountered the harsh facts
of life in the world beyond college computer laboratories. With their local-area
networks and T-1 links to the Internet, universities offered a revel for
budding cybernauts. Marc Andreessen of Netscape discovered a similar disjunction
between college lab and residential communications. At LAN's end was a communications
cliff and a bandwidth scandal. Most homes and offices connected to the world
only through twisted-pair, four-kilohertz, copper telephone wires. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In October of 1992, Freedman became an ISP chiefly to continue his college
revels by chasing bandwidth. Twenty-three at the time and engaged, he could
still recall his days in high school and remembered how much he had learned
from the Internet through his father's PDP-11. He began to fill up his basement
with second-hand Sun machines, mostly at prices well below new Pentium levels,
all using Berkeley Unix, equipped by Bill Joy with fast TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with 40 customers from local bulletin board systems, Freedman
provided access through the serial ports of a single SPARCstation IPC with
a 200-megabyte hard drive and 12 megabytes of memory that he purchased secondhand
for $1,500. The serial ports ran up to 38.4 kilobits per second, linked
to 14.4-kilobit-per-second Zoom and Supra modems connected to POTS (plain
old telephone service) outside lines running from the phone company's central
office. Costing a total of some $4,000, the system worked well enough until
his clientele began to multiply and the modems balked at continual resetting.
In April 1992, he bought a 16-port Iolan terminal server that answered the
phones and connected subscribers to the Sun servers, which supplied e-mail,
Usenet news, Gopher searches, Telnet and file-transfer services in a Unix
environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In June of 1992 emerged the menace of competition. A local entrepreneur
launched Voicenet by simply linking a 386 PC with a modem to each phone
line through a terminal server. Charging fees several times higher than
Net Access's, Voicenet thrived through the device of hiring two full-time
people to scan in pictures from porno magazines for what Freedman describes
as the &quot;sticky keyboard set.&quot; Eventually the &quot;adult&quot;
bulletin board service enlisted some 5,000 members paying $4 per hour to
peruse images. Nonetheless, Voicenet protested what it called Net Access's
predatory low pricing, a $12.50 to $20 flat rate per month with no full-time
employees to pay. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the early years of the Net's development, the late '80s, the Internet
business outside campuses and corporations was a small-time and sometimes
tacky trade. In 1992, the entire Net comprised a million linked computers,
many of them in university and government labs. It wasn't until November
1993 that Net Access acquired a dedicated 56-kilobit line for direct connection
to an official network access point. Costing $400 per month, it multiplexed
22 dial-up modems among 250 users. With the Mosaic World Wide Web browser
yet to catch on outside the universities, Net Access did not even have to
supply SLIP (serial line interface protocol) or PPP (point-to-point protocol)
accounts, which shield the user from the details of Unix. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman, however, saw the need for new technology to link people to the
full resources of the Net without having to know abstruse Unix commands.
&quot;As a professional geek, writing code is my true calling,&quot; he
says, adding that he threw himself into this work. Although the program
was eclipsed by Mosaic, Lynx and other approaches, he still believes that
his software provided easier access to the Internet, complete with the ability
to trace routes and &quot;ping&quot; remote machines. Enabling users to
log in to the program in 1992, he put Net Access on the technological forefront
of ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The largest challenge for an ISP, then and now, is managing the floods of
bits engulfing a Usenet news server at a rate of some 500 megabytes per
day, five news articles per second, each with a unique identification that
has to be scanned to assure that the news is fresh and not duplicated. The
heart of the Internet until the arrival of the World Wide Web -- and still
cherished more than the Web by many Internet veterans -- Usenet is the huge
collection of textual bulletin boards and other information troves and exchanges
from which the communities of the Net exfoliate. As Steve Willens of Livingston
Enterprises puts it: &quot;This is the real source of the Internet as we
know it and the challenge that forced the development of technology specialized
for the Net&quot; -- notably Livingston communications servers that linked
modems to the Net through fast comports functioning with compression at
115.2 kilobits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Freedman recognized he had a major business on his hands. He decided
to lease a T-1 line from PREP-NET (Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network), which required a prepayment of $1,000 per month. With 50 phone
lines and modems and 500 users, he broke all ties with Stony Brook and began
hiring people to handle a rising tide of traffic and a surging demand for
technical support. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That summer, he had three full-time people: &quot;Myself, my wife, Gail,
and my 20-year-old brother, Noam. Working with him made me realize why people
pay me so much money as a consultant [up to $150 an hour]. He served as
a kind of Avi echo, intuitively knowing what I wanted and when.&quot; A
student in computer science at the University of Chicago, Noam is in the
process of extending the business to that city, while Avi has established
points of presence in New York and Washington, D.C. He has hired five Net
Access customers, none with college degrees, to provide technical support
full time as the number of users has climbed at a pace of some 15% per month
since the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For links to other cities, Freedman relied on advice from telecommunications
consultant Gordon Jacobson, a Penn alumnus who maintains close links to
the Penn school of engineering, where his father graduated. With Jacobson's
help, Freedman is ending 1995 with a fiber circuit connecting him to MAE
East at 45 megabits a second, a 10-megabit-per-second link to Sprint's network-access
point, and more than half a dozen point-to-point T-1 lines, all for well
under half of the normally tariffed prices for these services. With increasing
broadband connectivity, Net Access commands more than half as much bandwidth
at the nerve centers of the Net as Netcom, which has 50 times more customers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though indispensable, technology alone cannot sustain a successful ISP.
It is people that make the vital difference. If Freedman had originally
hired people to perform the work that he did himself part-time -- &quot;keeping
the machines running, maintaining software, recovering from disasters, installing
and tuning equipment and circuits&quot; -- he would have incurred expenses
of some $100,000 per year and his financial model would have collapsed.
The reason many corporations are so slow to develop Internet programs is
not the lack of equipment but the dearth of personnel. The large companies
pursuing Net Access did not care about Freedman's rooms full of gear. They
were after Freedman himself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's entrepreneurship and technology ride on a tide of other enterprise
by the suppliers of Internet gear. These, too, are not huge telephone company
equipment manufacturers or rising software monopolists but mostly small
or medium-size companies, led by young entrepreneurs, fighting to survive
in the most intensely competitive arena of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An Internet service provider must begin by supplying modems through which
the outside world can connect to his offerings. With millions of home customers
who dwarf the ISP modem volumes, U.S. Robotics is currently ascendant in
most ISPs, but Freedman spurns them for cheaper devices from Multi-Tech.
These modems connect to a Xylogics terminal server that authenticates the
name and password combination entered by the user and validates the caller
as legitimate. Then the customer enters Net Access's local-area network
linking a set of Sun Microsystems servers that supply World Wide Web, Gopher,
Usenet, e-mail, file transfer, Telnet and other Internet services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access is unusual for an ISP, since few use Xylogics equipment. Recently
bought out by Bay Networks, Xylogics supplied nearly all the terminal servers
for the university market, and it still shies away from the tumultuous world
of ISPs. These customers mostly use Livingston products that run a security
protocol named Radius (remote authentication dial-in user services). Channeling
the bits around the ISP's internal net and on to other networks are banks
of routers, also often built by Cisco or Livingston (although Freedman originally
chose Morningstar because it was cheaper). Linking a particular ISP to other
ISPs and network access points are T-1 cables running at 1.544 megabits
per second through multiplexing and demultiplexing and conditioning equipment.
These functions are performed by DSU-CSUs (data service units-channel service
units) made by such companies as TxPort, Adtran, General DataComm and ADC
Kentrox. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman insists on the Law of the Microcosm in choosing all his equipment
and in making all his projects for expansion. Since his study of distributed
computing at Temple, he has everywhere cherished duplication and redundancy
and cheap components over centralization and scale economies. He at first
bought a nine-gigabyte drive from Micropolis. Now he regrets the decision
and is replacing it with five two-gigabyte drives (more I/O [input/output],
redundancy and reliability). &quot;The more spindles the better,&quot; he
says. He buys lots of cheap secondhand Suns rather than one powerful server.
He criticizes some of the larger ISPs, such as Netcom, for centralizing
their servers and technical support. It causes bottlenecks and delays, he
says, and opens the system to crashes if any of the communication lines
go down. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's rule is to provide service as locally as possible. He believes
ISPs with fully equipped local network sites, rather than mere communications
nodes like Netcom's, will prevail. Like most small ISPs, Freedman is wedded
to flat-rate pricing, though his accounts of altercations with customers
who want to resell or overgraze his commons may undermine confidence that
this pricing regime can survive into the future. But managing flat-rate
prices is a core competence of the ISPs. Believing that bits will flee toward
flat rates, Freedman says MCI will fail in its plans to transform Internet
pricing models by adding some as yet unannounced scale of measured usage
based on time, packets or both. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is Freedman's model scalable, or is it doomed as he grows? Could Freedman
be displaced by MCI or Sprint-Comcast or Bell Atlantic or Microsoft-UUNet
or AT&T in a siege of merger-monopolization? He believes that up until a
threshold of some 25,000 to 50,000 customers, meaning revenues of between
$5 million and $10 million net of more lucrative business clients, his economic
and technical model can trump all comers. At that point, he will face the
usual entrepreneurial crisis of transition: Freedman will need business
partners, routinized technology management schemes and expensive accounting
to maintain operations as Net Access spreads across the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But he does not fear competition. His problems, he says, are servicing the
flood of new customers and anticipating the depredations of &quot;Congresscritters&quot;
who want to make him liable for any vagrant flasher who strays onto one
of his hard drives. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still a small force in the global matrix of telecommunications, Freedman
now dreams of exploiting available resources of fiber, dark and lit, to
acquire major new bandwidth, linking cities up and down the East Coast and
across the U.S. Helping Freedman move this project toward reality is his
telecom guru Jacobson, an entrepreneurial dervish from Portman Communications.
With financiers on the line to supply some $5 million in startup capital,
Jacobson is planning to launch a national IRamp network. The service will
ultimately open fully staffed Internet access facilities in 30 cities nationwide,
linked everywhere by fiber, at a cost of some $1 million per site. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such investment looms large compared to the rock-bottom base of Freedman's
operation, and easily eclipses a national ISP's point-of-presence facility
that can cost upwards of $70,000. But David Farber, gigabit-testbed guru,
recently told a New York audience at the Penn Club that, spurred by business
needs, the marketplace is seeking higher-end, stable-broadband ISP services
that can handle millions of hits a day at a Web site with no access delays
or congestion and that provide local access and custom software configuration.
For these high-end customers, the SPARC 20 servers and T-1 and 56-kilobit
links of the many small ISPs will no longer suffice. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering the kind of broadband channels that will eventually become ubiquitous
on the Net, IRamp's planned facilities will command OC-3 fiber (155 megabits
per second) links to a national network of both dark and lit fiber, available
from utilities, pipelines and other unusual sources. Such bypass strategies
will become increasingly common in coming years. The 10 million miles of
fiber currently installed in the U.S., after all, is exploited to approximately
one-millionth of its potential capacity -- and much of it is unused &quot;dark
fiber.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For key ISP server and security functions, Jacobson plans to use fully fault-tolerant
Tandem S4000 servers running the new ServerNet multibus scheme. It was conceived
by venerable Tandem designer Robert Horst as a new-generation architecture
explicitly optimized to substitute bandwidth for switching speeds. Fully
scalable, ServerNet was licensed in October by Compaq, yet it commands a
theoretical throughput limit of an unprecedented petabit per second (a million
billion bits). For graphics-intensive applications, Jacobson envisages Silicon
Graphics WebForce Challenge S servers using Irix software. Even with as
few as 5,000 subscribers per site paying a competitive nonusage-based rate,
Jacobson projects a high rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, at Netcom, the nation's largest ISP, David Garrison, the CEO,
is undergoing the stresses that Freedman foresees for himself as he expands
his business. During his previous stint at the helm of the meteoric paging
company, SkyTel, Garrison, a rangy dark-haired entrepreneur with a slight
uneasiness in his ready smile of prosperity, thought he had approached the
ultimate in entrepreneurial excitement. But nothing in his career in the
wireless industry prepared him for his first nine months as head of Netcom.
Here is a company that during the last three quarters grew from 400 to 1,200
employees, from 58 to 201 points of presence, from 72,000 to more than 200,000
customers, and from revenues of $12.4 million in 1994 to a $50 million run
rate in 1995 and to a market cap of some $400 million, while the traffic
in bits grows at an even faster pace -- impelled by the graphic demands
of the World Wide Web, itself expanding at the rate of more than 1,000 new
servers per week. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netcom pares down its points of presence to simple communications nodes
and handles all the technical support and Internet services for them at
the company's headquarters. This operation fills up a high-rise in San Jose.
Some floors teem with desks manned by earnest engineers in jeans, many of
them Asian, working the phones. Other floors are replete with row upon row
of racks filled wall-to-wall with Cisco routers, Sun servers, Livingston
PortMasters, Ascend ISDN pipelines, Cascade edge switches and U.S. Robotics
modems. Walking through these ever-expanding mazes of machinery, Garrison's
entrepreneurial smile at times moves from the ready to the giddy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this environment of riotous growth, the telcos move their slow thighs
like trolls under the bridges and routers of the Internet. Currently commanding
perhaps 2% of the traffic, AT&amp;T, for example, has declared its ambition
to capture 60% of the Internet business over the next two years. But Garrison
demurs: &quot;From the Olympian perspective of a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant,
AT&amp;T could take over any business. They have one of the greatest brand
names in the world, they've got more money than God, a billing relationship
with some 40 million people, a global network and alliances and consortia,
Internet pioneer Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman in their fold, and they have
perhaps the world's largest internal World Wide Web on their own Unix servers
among their 300,000 employees.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But like most of the telcos, AT&amp;T lacks focus. As Netcom marketing chief
John Zeisler explains: &quot;Phone companies have their 700 numbers, 800
numbers, corporate customers, their Hollywood links, their leased lines,
their frame relay, their ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), their
cable aspirations, their huge wireless opportunities, their bureaucracy,
their regulatory tariffs, their pricing confusions. Should voice be priced
as data or should data be priced as voice? They are great at laying fiber
and wire, connecting it to switches and bringing signals to the central
office and to the curb. But the Internet is a second thought, just another
business to them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in the PC industry, focus and agility are crucial. In an arena where
the technologies ride a remorseless onrush of exponential changes, no prolonged
bureaucratic process can succeed. Even the maps and schematics of rapid
convergence among media industries miss the point. Dominating this arena
is the computer industry -- with its millions of piranha processors and
entrepreneurs -- and it doesn't converge with anything; it eats everything
in its path. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ascendant is the Internet computer industry. Most of these new companies,
from Livingston to Netscape, focus on the Internet. Using personal computer
components to reduce the price of ISP infrastructure far below the price
of telco installations, these companies endow the ISPs with a further advantage
in a dynamic industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Livingston Enterprises epitomizes the success of the new companies creating
this new industry. Secreted in Pleasanton, Calif., and financed by corporate
cash flow, Livingston has grown up with the Internet at a pace not far in
the wake of its more illustrious rival, Cisco Systems. Livingston PortMasters
crowd Netcom's headquarters, as they do most of the other ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched in 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sillens, then a manager
of multiprocessors at Sun Microsystems, Livingston's networking drive began
by creating a cheap router and communications server based on a new operating
system, ComOS, specifically developed to help ISPs meet their Usenet burdens.
Livingston quickly became a dominant force in Internet terminal servers
and routers, and grew at a pace of more than 50% per year until engulfed
by an explosion of demand in 1995. In August of this year, Livingston launched
cheap low-end routers to serve both ends of an Internet connection: a $1,395
two-port PortMaster to link small offices to the Net at up to 230.4 kilobits
per second and a sleek space-saving $3,495 PortMaster with 24 ports for
ISPs. In October, Livingston announced a series of ISDN remote-access machines
that will compete with the currently dominant Ascend ISDN pipeline system,
if ISDN becomes the preferred mode of Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, everywhere in the Internet industry companies are resigning themselves
to ISDN as the next &quot;modem&quot; (though, in fact it just brings into
home and office the 64Kbps digital channels long used by the telcos between
central offices). The scandal of U.S. telecom, however, is that the telcos
could just as easily be bringing video capable T-1 service (1.544 megabits
per second of bandwidth, equivalent to CD-ROMs) to homes if regulations
permitted a reasonable tariff structure. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, new access technologies are emerging, such as cable modems and
AT&amp;T's new SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber loop). Available this
year and under test by Bell Atlantic, SDSL modems promise to bring T-1-Line
capability to homes on twisted-pair copper wires for about $10 a month.
SDSL follows many such copper prosthetics announced over the years (notably
HDSL) [high bit rate digital subscriber line] from Level One, PairGain,
Brooktree and others), all largely spurned by the telcos on pricing grounds,
but capable of transforming the entire world of Internet access before ISDN's
niggardly pipes catch on with the public. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While Internet hardware rushes ahead, Netscape, Sun and other providers
of Internet software make the ISP a fast and elusively moving target for
the telcos that wish to compete. With eight million browsers in the field,
all upgradeable to the new 2.0 system--with the Java interpreter and Java
multimedia programming language and toolkit--Netscape expects to attract
some 100,000 software developers to its platform over the next year. There
are already some 400 Java applications available, including word processors,
spreadsheets and games that can play on any machine with a browser running
a Java interpreter, regardless of operating system or microprocessor instruction
set. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's expected army of 100,000 developers compares with some 10,000
developers for Apple's Macintosh and perhaps 3,000 for Microsoft's network,
MSN. Emerging from a company that did not even exist two years ago, such
a juggernaut will further empower the ISPs in their competition with the
large invaders of the territory--not only the telcos but also the on-line
services such as American Online and MSN. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ISPs, however, are not usually in direct competition with the large
phone companies. ISPs bring them new customers and new business users, and
the ISPs also depend on them for home connections and for potential fiber-trunking
services. The American telcos are currently laying some 1,300 miles of fiber-optic
line every day. Moreover, beginning with TCI's and Kleiner Perkins' @home
system, which functions with cable modems and new software from Netscape,
the ISPs also may end up using cable plant. As cable modems become available,
cable companies will likely turn to the ISPs to supply Internet services,
local content, technical support and point-of-presence technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of these whitewater torrents of change, the some 4,000 ISPs
and their increasing armies of supporters represent a serious threat to
many of the established empires of telecom. Not only can they move much
faster and more resourcefully, but they also have the key advantage of having
bet exclusively on the PC and the Internet as the platforms of the future.
However smart and powerful, Ray Smith, Mike Ovits of Disney, Gerland Levin
and Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone and other aspiring Kings of the Road still
entertain crippling visions of set-top boxes and interactive TV sets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove of Intel had the last word for these efforts when he told Forbes
ASAP last year: &quot;By the time the set-top people reach the price points
and form factors of consumer electronics and penetrate 30% of homes, the
personal computer will be everywhere, controlling the TV like a minor peripheral.&quot;
Bill Joy elaborated on this point in the October issue of Red Herring: &quot;By
the time [they] bring digital TV to the home, you will be able to take your
Super Netscape version 4.0 Web browser with Super-Ultra-HotJava-Burners,
and that will be your animated user interface. [The TV people tried, but[
it's like the Internet happened in the meantime. Right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Distracting most of the large companies (seen by the Internet's critics
as impending monopolists), the pursuit of the set-top not only misses the
point and begs the question but it also blows the key new hardware opportunity
of the epoch. Although the PC will not be dislodged for most office applications,
there is a real and rare chance today to create a new home architecture
and software optimized for the bandwidth rather than for installed base.
Together with the Java language, the Web browser breakthrough allows creation
of new network PC and software architectures at price points that take advantage
of the &quot;hollowing out of the computer&quot; caused by the impact of
the Internet. Sun, Apple, Oracle and Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's BeBox are
all focusing on this target today. All are trying to take advantage of the
elusive opportunity of creating cheap machines optimized for bandwidth and
graphics rather than for legacy software baggage (the storage can be supplied
on the Net). That opportunity follows the PC and Internet model--the microcosm
and the telecosm--into the cornucopian digital future of the information
age, with the old analog TV and telephone left far behind. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>AMID ALL THESE TORRENTS</B> of futuristic technology and prophecies of
a tragic denouement in a wasted commons, it is comforting to return to the
man who began it all, Vinton Cerf of MIC. Coinventor of the Internet protocol
TCP/IP, developer of the once-pioneering and a philosopher of the Net, he
is now in charge of MCI's data network, which includes MCI's Internet backbone
network. A rare combination of technical grit and visionary enthusiasm,
he faces resistance from forces within the company that still lust for the
glamour of Hollywood and see the Internet as the CB radio of the 1990s.
Nonetheless, Cerf at 52 is leading MCI toward a new Internet-centric strategy
that is more likely than the MCI lobbyists to save the company from the
grave perils of long-distance deregulation. The company is already creating
a new backbone for the National Science Foundation part of the Internet,
connecting supercomputer centers and other high-bandwidth applications at
speeds of up to 622 megabits per second. MCI also is a major supplier of
Internet bandwidth. Its network connects to all six NAPs (national access
points) through which the ISPs link to one another. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cerf observes that the national phone network grew at a similar pace through
much of its history and regularly met ever challenge. The telcos, for instance,
surmounted the predicted crisis of the NAPs early this year, when--following
the withdrawal of government funds--the network was expected to collapse
under galloping increase sin traffic. But the NAPs, despite unsuccessful
struggles with the remaining instabilities of ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode), ultimately rose to the challenge, saving the Net by using fiber optics
and digitization, as well as transparent silicon and opaque silicon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, new entrepreneurs are rising up to shape the future of broadband
networks and possibly seize the market from the incumbent backbone suppliers.
Silicon, both see-through ad solid, remains at the heart of the solution.
One of the ways MCI is meeting the challenge of the future is by purchasing
eight &quot;gigarouters&quot; from NetStar, a startup in Minneapolis that
is exploiting Moore's Law to bring IP (Internet Protocol) switching and
router technology into the microcosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched five years ago by a group of veterans of the Minneapolis supercomputer
scene--Lee Data, Cray and other companies--NetStar went public this fall
at a $83 million valuation. It is pioneering an elegant routing architecture
that gets eight times the throughput of a Cisco 7500 at a 20% lower price.
While existing routers run bits down shared backplane buses, NetStar's IP
router reserves a full one gigabit per each of up to 16 media cards attached
to a single-chip TriQuint 16 gigabit-cross-bar switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ubiquitous on the Internet, Cisco remains an imperial force. But as the
microcosm advances, it too faces threats. Not only can it not compete with
NetStar at the top of the line but it also faces Livingston, Ascend and
possibly even Compaq at the bottom. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Critics of the Internet have long predicted that as ever-more-turbulent
floods of broadband data and Web images crowd the commons, the Net will
no longer be able to bear the load. The routers in the NAPs and other critical
paths will jam up and crash. But the microcosm enables a constant stream
of exponentially more powerful new architectures as functions that were
once spread out across entire boards collapse into single chips and multichip
modules. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For 1995 and beyond, MCI has bent on NetStar's feats of microchip integration
to countervail every population explosion across the network commons. Following
the laws of the telecosm rather than the megalithic visions of the critics,
the fast new networks are becoming constantly dumber and more entrepreneurial.
Ciena Corp., a small, venture-funded vendor of optical networks, is now
supplying the next generation of back-bone gear, a system that can carry
16 separate bitstreams on every fiber thread. The first application of the
new all-optical technology in public networks, is now Ciena's innovation
is a precursor of the terabit (trillion-bit throughput) networks that will
be filled with video teleconferencing, video on demand, virtual reality,
and other bit-thronging and polygon-shuffling applications of the future.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Only one competitor, Northern Telecom, might challenge NetStar and the others
providing the new superswitches dumb enough to prevail at the top of the
line. In early October, Northern's BNR lab exhibited a terabit-switch architecture
at the Telecom 95 show in Geneva. This machine, once again, illustrates
the triumph of dumb networks. The dumb terminals of the past, whether POTS
phones or mainframe 3270 panels, required smart networks, with central-office
switches from Northern and AT&amp;T containing no fewer than 26 million
lines of software code. But the new Northern terabit uses passive optical
components and virtually no software at all. It points to the evolution
of a fibershpere for broadband wire traffic that will function like the
atmosphere for wireless traffic. (See Forbes ASPA, &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot;
December 7, 1992). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the critics of the new technology fix on the foibles of television
and the monolithic aggregations of old media, the Internet is emerging as
an entrepreneurial efflorescence. Comparing the Net to the decline of CB
radio and the tragedy of the commons misses the providential convergence
of the laws espoused by Moore and Metcalfe, with thousands of entrepreneurs
in tow, exponentially expanding the commons with streams of new invention
in a creative spiral of growth and opportunity. In seeing the technology
as a killer of jobs and family life and a polarizer of opportunities between
rich and poor, they miss the most radically egalitarian force in the history
of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics seem oblivious to the most basic realities of the U.S. job miracle.
While the U.S. deployed three times as much as computer power per capita
as any other industrial region, this country created some 45 million jobs
in 25 years at rising, real incomes. Not only was the U.S. a world leader
in the proportion of its working-age population with jobs, but it also created
employment for some 12 million immigrants, while its corporations endowed
new work for people around the globe. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, a billion people, mostly Third World Asians, used the
technology to leap into Third Wave riches without ever having to endure
a heavy industrial phase. Gaps between the rich and the poor collapsed everywhere
that the networks reached, as former peasants around the world--from Bangalore
to Los Angeles--gained new freedom and opportunity from the information
economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet creates jobs by making workers more productive, and thus more
employable, regardless of where they live. By engendering more investable
wealth, it endows new work, providing the key remedy for the job displacement
entailed by all human progress. By aggregating distant markets, the Internet
enables more specialization, and more productivity and excellence. It will
help all people, but most particularly the poor, who always comprise the
largest untapped market for enterprise. And the Internet will continue to
grow, transforming the global economy with its power and building a new
industry even larger than the PC's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>FUELING THE TRANSFORMATION</B> are the laws of the telecosm. They begin
with Metcalfe's Law: The power of computers on a network rises with the
square of the total power of computers attached to it. Every new computer,
therefore, both use the Net as a resource and adds resources to the Net
in a spiral of increasing value and choice. This means that any limited,
exclusive or proprietary network will tend to lose business to a more open,
accessible and widely connected network. Metcalfe's Law dooms all the dreams
of the Time Warners of the world to create exclusive and proprietary combinations
of content and conduit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a further rule, networks prevail to the extent that they feed on the
invention and creativity of their users, since the power of the computers
on the edge of the network will increasingly dwarf the intelligence of the
network fabric itself. For example, a 5ESS central-office switch from AT&amp;T,
commanding some 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and linking
some 110,000 lines, once represented the most powerful computer in a local
phone network. Today those 10 MIPS are infinitesimal compared to the collective
computer power of the tens of thousands of personal computers, each commanding
20 to 100 MIPS, linked by modems to the switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lacking an entrepreneurial environment of inventive users, the government-run
PTTs (Post Telegraph and Telephone) of Europe have been rapidly losing ground
to the U.S.'s more rivalrous RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies) and
long-distance carriers, and all have been losing ground to the explosion
of interconnected private nets. The U.S. has some 700,000 private networks
compared to just 14,000 in Europe and some 75,000 in Japan. Private nets
that feed on the creativity of their users will always tend to prevail over
public nets, such as France's Minitel or American's interactive TV projects,
that try to supply their entire system from a central office. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt of Sun offers a true parable of the Net. Back when the Internet
was the Arpanet, two routers were added to the system, but the routers'
hopping ratio (the number of hops to any destination) got struck at zero.
Because traffic always seeks out the optimal path, most of the traffic on
the Net rushed to these two machines, since they promised instant transmission.
Until the settings were corrected, the system was swamped. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the Net, traffic will always gravitate to the most efficient broadband
channels. If the telcos and software monopolists attempt to gouge customers
in a badly designed and costly &quot;top-down&quot; network, traffic will
migrate rapidly toward the freedom and bandwidth of a bottom-up solution.
In the engineering global Internet, these channels could emerge among bypass
suppliers using dark fiber; among low-earth-orbit satellite systems, such
as Teledesic and GlobalStar; among cable companies and renegade long-distance
suppliers; or among companies as yet unknown. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guided by the valuations of the market, capital follows a similar rule:
It is routed rapidly to the channels where it can be used more productively.
At present, afflicted by perverse regulations that bar phone and cable companies
from collaborating in the same region, valuations of these companies are
low. Meanwhile, analysis complain of the excessive valuations for ISPs,
such as Netcom, and their suppliers, such as Cisco, 3Com and Netscape. Not
only traffic but also investment flows to the least regulated and most enterpreneurial
arena. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A further law of the telecosm ordains that, in an age of dumb terminals
and phones, traffic flows to smart networks full of intricate software.
In an age of ever-multiplying computer power, impelled b Metcalfe's Law,
traffic flows to the dumbest networks that gain their intelligence from
the variety of powerful machines attached to them. A corollary is that,
along with traffic, capital flows to the dumbest and most broadband nets
with the most computer intelligence on their edges. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important of all is the cultural law of the telecosm. Networks
promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality. Television
is culturally erosive because its small range of offerings requires a broad,
lowest-common-denominator appeal. Linking to millions of cultural sources,
global networks provide a cornucopia of choices, like a Library of Congress
at your fingertips. On the Net, as at a giant bookstore, you always get
your first choice rather than a lowest-common-denominator choice. A culture
of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics of the Internet are mostly skeptical about the value of choice.
But choice validates freedom and substantiates individuality. Choice accords
with the inexorable genetic diversity of humans. It makes possible individual
aspiration and creativity. It is the lowest-common-denominator offerings
of mass-broadcast media that lower humans to the animal level, eclipsing
the differences that make us human, cutting off the higher aspirations and
inspirations that elevate us beyond our appetites, reducing us to an impressionable
crowd, zapping through the channels looking for a splash of blood or flash
of nudity or demagogic spiel of hate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In prophesying centralization and tyranny, the Cassandras miss the centrifugal
forces of the Law of the Microcosm, overthrowing all monopolies, hierarchies,
pyramids and power grids of established industrial society and endowing
individuals with the power to be transcendent and free. <BR>

Take George Gilder's Aug. 28 ForbesASAP piece, &quot;The Coming Software Shift.&quot; Lucky Forbes readersgot their copies in mid-August, smack between the year's two biggest technologyevents--Netscape's record-hot IPO and the release of Windows 95. Gilderused the timing to explain why creative energy and profits in desk-top softwarewould soon migrate from Microsoft to the Internet and toward companies likeNetscape. Needless to say, Gilder's point is controversial, drawing fireand praise from a host of computerdom's biggest names </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Nathan Myhrvold, Group Vice-President, Applications and Content Group,Microsoft </H3><BR><BR>As usual, George Gilder's diagnosis is dead-on. The software industry functionsby turning its fuel-cheap processing power, as described by Moore's Law--intovalue for consumers. In turn, software soon soaks up CPU power, fuelingmarket demand, which sustains Moore's Law. The software-hardware twosomeis about to become a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, with the addition ofcommunications. The three-way cycle will drive growth and value creationin each area at an even faster rate than we've seen so far. I begin to differwhen George frames the computer industry in lurid terms of battle. In reality,computer industry shifts are quite dull affairs. The multidecade declineof the mainframe has been a lot like watching a glacier melt. A leadingcompany fails to invest in new technology and ultimately finds its productobsolete. New entrants might capitalize on this, but most--including Netscapeand HotJava--blaze new trails instead. When an established leader does fall,the proximate cause is almost always slow suicide or atrophy through internalmismanagement; not the wounds of combat. The Internet means opportunityfor all software developers--new and old. Mosaic and its commercial descendantsare currently at the center of the cyclones, but their day in the sun willpass just as surely as it did for previous Internet standards like Gopheror FTP. The instant rise of Mosaic and Netscape foreshadows what Georgemight dub another Law of the Telecosm: In a world with easy electronic distribution,it is very hard to hang onto your position--easy come, easy go. A particularweakness of HTML is that it is a data format no different in spirit fromthe protocols of 1970s-vintage mainframe terminals. Next-generation Internetsoftware will use programmability at both ends of the pipe. Java is noteworthyand may play a role, but its hype falls into a very old trap. Every newprogramming language is heralded as a breakthrough. Fortran was going tocomputerize science and engineering, Cobol would revolutionalize business,and Lisp (and later, Prolog) would deliver us to the promised land of AI.The reality is quite different--new languages offer some modest benefits,but all of the real value resides in the programs created with them. Finally,I must comment on the obsession with finding the next Gates. Bill has beenmy friend and colleague for nearly 10 years, so the topic is familiar. Writinggreat software and founding a company is a first step, but that only matchesBill Gates circa 1976. The secret that made the Bill Gates of 1995 is tohave the technical and business skills to develop new product lines repeatedly.Microsoft is unique in this accomplishment. Our competition is invariablysingle-product companies, or ex post facto assemblages of them. I don'tdoubt that the next Gates will eventually appear, and the Internet may fuelher rise, but it's one hell of a tough act to follow. Scott Mcnealy, ChiefExecutive Officer, Sun Microsystems I'd like to compliment George Gilderfor so eloquently articulating Sun's nearly decade-old credo: &quot;Thenetwork is the computer.&quot; I believe in Gilder's thesis that we are,indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed, disposable software.Desktop operating systems, utilities and applications will soon be relegatedto peripheral status. The network will be the operating system, and, asGilder points out, this change is being brought about the almost incomprehensiblemomentum of the Internet. The ultimate change agent, Gilder suggests, mayin fact be Java, yet another technology that Sun has offered to the industryin an open and barrier-free way. Java is a programming language that createsthe first true network operating system for the globe, because it is safe,secure, robust, fault tolerant and, among many other attributes, platform-independent.Here's how we see it playing out. three computer science students from Berkeleyhacking code late at night will create a Java word processing program. Let'scall it &quot;NetWord.&quot; They put it on their Web server at http://www.netword.com.It will be free because these kids want fame first, knowing that will leadto fortune as with their hero, Marc Andreessen. It will be 100,000 linesof code versus 1.5 million for WordPerfect, because NetWord isn't boggeddown with all the APIs [applications programming interfaces] and other extraneousbaggage of typical applications that must interoperate with a specific operatingsystem, or have become overfeatured. So you're shopping for a new word processingprogram. You've seen the ads offering Word on sale for $249. Of course,you know that means you get the privilege of upgrading in a year for another$89. Your buddy sends an e-mail and says check out NetWord. You take a testdrive. It works! Cool! You are not alone. A few million others have heardabout NetWord. Now the makers have a following and in a few months theystart a company and offer NetWord 2.0 for a mere $2 per copy. You and 10million other avid followers have no qualms about paying the nominal fee.It sure beats the competition. In fact, at that price, you'll be checkingthe NetWord home page monthly to download the latest copy. As of the threecollege kids, they are now millionaires. Suddenly the OS that controls theCPU on your desktop is a legally of an old paradigm, relegated to a secondarytier in the software food chain. This means that Microsoft is now a severelyoverpriced personal productivity tools applications vendor with an OS businessthat is no longer able to &quot;captivate&quot; the end user by being theonly platform to run desired applications. Keeping API's secret won't workanymore. Controlling the interfaces won't work anymore. The wall is downand there's no turning back. So where will that leave Microsoft? Scramblingto explain to investors why the company's market cap is 10 times revenues,scrambling to explain how they can survive in the world of disposable, run-anywhereInternet software. Of course, the marketing muscle up in the Northwest willtry to figure out a way to play in this space. But playing now means playingon a level field. The rules are the same for everyone. They're spelled TCP/IP,Mosaic, WWW, HTTP, HTML and now Java--all the open protocols and languagesthat make up the Internet. It's barrier-free computing. It's consumer choice.It's a free-market economy in the information age, finally. From there,just about anything is possible. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Tesler, Vice President and Chief Scientist, Apple Computer </H3><BR><BR>To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring percipience,perspiration and perspective. Gilder has done it. He has combed throughthe attics of computing and assembled for the family a gripping album ofthe events and circumstances that created the phenomenon we call the Web.If the past is buried in clutter, however, the future is still more difficultto perceive, especially before the dazzle of Netscape and Java. In my view,the Web is a catalyst, but it is not all that matters about the Internet.The browser is to the Internet what the spreadsheet was to the desktop computer.Mosaic is the new VisiCalc, Netscape Navigator the new Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoftwould like to make Explorer the new Excel. Wall Street is as enamored withNetscape today as it was with Lotus when that company went public. Netscapeis a winner, but is the winner? With the aid of its ally, the Sun King,will it inherit the throne? Not necessarily. Where is the proprietary operatingsystem that runs not merely the equivalent of spreadsheets, but thousandsof applications? Where is the PI that some megalomaniac weaves into, well,a web, to attract, ensnare and ultimately consume hapless applications developersand most of the profits they worked so hard to earn? I hope that the namelessidealists who create the Internet on a daily basis succeed in their resistanceto central control more successfully than did their computer club counterpartsa decade ago. If they do, there may be no single successor to Bill Gates.If they don't then it's anyone's guess who will maneuver into that role.The drama promises to remain gripping. <BR><HR><H3>Howard Anderson, Founder, Yankee Group </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George - what took you so long? What is so surprising isthat you were so surprised that the Netscape revolution may supersede theMicrosoft revolution. Think back! Fifteen years ago, the office automationhype was about word processing, but the real revolution was electronic mail.Today 36 million Americans get their mail electronically and no one reallygives a damn about new word processing packages. Your beatification of MarcAndreessen is a little premature, don't you think? There are many visionaries,but few company builders. We in the venture community intuitively know thatthere is little likelihood that the visionaries will turn into the operatingmanagers new industries need. Other than Gates, who? What you have proposed(correctly) is that the peripheral becomes the major focus. Five years ago,the thought that IBM and the clone industry would become &quot;value-addedresellers&quot; for Intel and Microsoft would have been heresy. Now youare suggesting that the Internet will become the major focus--and Inteland Microsoft will be relegated to that &quot;value-added&quot; focus. Youare right. Nonetheless, quite frankly, the Internet needs three years tobe ready for prime time. Meanwhile, we will go through a sine curve of hype,backlash, then reality. Just when the naysayers sound and seem logical,the Internet will begin to fulfill its destiny, and that destiny is to becomethe most potent force in technology. And George, invite your mother to dinnerfor me. Of your technobabble family, she seems the most interesting! <BR><HR><H3>John Perry Barlow, Rancher, Writer, Web Guru, <BR>Grateful Dead Lyricist </H3><BR><BR><BR>I am enormously encouraged by George Gilder's discovery of the World WideWeb. I'm tempted to stoop to catty remarks about how long it took him. Lately,he's seemed almost alone among intelligent commentators in continuing tocredit the myth of the information superhighway--a belief that you can sustainonly if you don't know about the Web or if your perceptions have been profoundlyaltered by the reality-distortion fields generated within large contentconglomerates, telcos or cable companies, or the vast cluelessness thatis Washington, D.C. In fact, anyone using the phrase information superhighwayis almost certainly in the thrall of some large and doomed institution,or is a complete nimrod who knows only what he hears on television. Whichis, for obvious reasons, filled with people who believe in it. They're notgoing to be roadkill on it, by golly. They're going to find that on-ramp. . . hey, they're going to be the on-ramp! No way, San Jose! The futureof the Industrial Era media megaliths, whether Disney, Time Warner or, moreto the point, Microsoft, will arrive over the Web, not the mythical infobahn.The Web will be the end of them. We are up against a discontinuous leapas we hit the next layer of interactive complexity, both in software andin thought. It has now reached a point where about the only way to developall the scripts, scraps and code objects from which the next World WideOperating System (WWOS) will assemble itself is to grow them in the distributed,massively parallel amalgam of minds and processes that make up the Net.The Web is alive, and filled with life, nearly as mysterious, complex and,well, natural as a primordial swamp. Microsoft is a factory. You can't manufacturelife in a factory. You have to grow it in nature. This ___________ so new,really. _______________'s proprietary claims notwithstanding, I take thefirst WWOS, Unix, as proof that if enough graduate students type into enoughterminals long enough, they will eventually produce an operating system.And given enough graduate students, you can be sure that somewhere amongthem will be a Bill Joy or a Marc Andreessen. In accordance with Joy's Law,they won't be working at Microsoft. Furthermore, the Web and most browsersgive them a way to crib from one another, lavishly and easily. All that'snecessary to see the code that generated what's on your screen is to click:&quot;View source.&quot; All that's necessary to get your page employingsome of the same innovations is to copy and paste. This creates an environmentof dense autocollaboration. To see how productive it's already been in lessthan two years of existence, get on the Web now. This will make the micromputerrevolution look like a good start. Gilder's article is a fine thing. I'vebeen talking about the End of Microsoft for a couple of years and have feltlike a madman parading a ragged sign. When it starts coming from such impeccableseersuckers as George Gilder, it may be time to short a little of that Microsoftstock. <BR><HR><H3>Bert C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman &amp; CEO MCI Communications </H3><BR><BR>Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will becomesubordinate to the network; that the network will, in effect, become subordinateto the network; that the network will, in effect, become everything andthe only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution and impact of theInternet and the resultant focus on content. Gilder's allusions to Gatesand Microsoft, however, yield a very real question: Can they deal with thecoming transformation? Doing so will require a new vision of the futureand a new understanding of merging industries, evolving ways of computing,and some hard new facts. Here's a key one: Companies that don't addressand act on the need for collaborative work from a widening universe willfall hard--and fast. Confronting any rival with the market dominance ofMicrosoft will be very difficulty. But trying to run in place could be evenharder. The challenge is not only to understand, as Gilder writes, &quot;thatyour computer will never be the same&quot;--but also that it's your companythat will never be the same. Dan Lynch, Founder, Interop Chairman, CybercashGilder has got it figured out. His article is dead-on about how the Internetis the architecture of the future for information dissemination. Want proof?Pouring huge resources into its Microsoft Network and Microsoft Navigatorofferings, Microsoft admits that it does not really know the business modelfor how to make money in this new arena, but it is determined to get onthe playing field in a big way. Meanwhile, Sun is too hooked on hardwareprofits to make a new fortune on this round. No doubt that Java is the righttechnology for making the Net be the center of the universe. Sun shouldsimply spin that group out as a new company unfettered by dragging alonghardware. The only fault I find with Gilder's article is his picking MarcAndreessen as the next Bill Gates. Marc only has a few percent of Netscapestock; Bill has tons of Microsoft stock. Marc will make a lot of othersmuch richer and he surely won't suffer, but he will not become a feared/lovedmogul because of Netscape. Maybe he and Bill Joy should bolt and start theirown company? Marc is still younger than Gates was when Microsoft got itsplum from IBM. I asked Marc one question when I met him during his briefstint at EIT in Menlo Park. What was the central design assumption for Mosaic?He said 45 megabits per second! I asked why. He said that it makes it easyto program because you do not have to develop hairy mechanisms to mask outthe slowness of the network. Then commercial reality set in when he andJim Clark got together and they recentered their Netscape Navigator forthe 14.4 kilobit world, thus giving us the MS-DOS of the Internet. It isa good start, but Marc was right about 45 megabits--only it is not justto make the programmer's life easy, it is to make the consumer's life joyful.<BR><HR><H3>Nicholas Negroponte, Director, MIT media Lab Author, Being Digital </H3><BR><BR>Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past and futureof the Net is on the digital dime and, as best I hear from my colleaguesat the MIT Media Lab, Java is really hot. We're betting our house on it.The Net, however, is no place for kings. It is a collective intelligencethat will work in spite of government and any attempts to control it. NoCarnegies, Rockefellers or Harrimans this time. The white envelope, George,is empty. When Larry Roberts invented the Internet in 1969, his decentralistapproach made the idea interesting for the military, because it was fail-safe.More than 25 years later, after the Vietnam and Cold wars, the Net is alsosafe from dominance of any kind. Supercomputer &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Unixhackers and Media Lab alumni have moved it forward (not Windows or Mac users),because they are made of the right stuff. This is serious media and computerscience, not the world of Windows applications. Here is where George iswrong. The next Bill Gates is not Marc Andreessen. Yes, Marc will do verywell. However, if you were a sucker to pay $75 per share for Netscape atthe opening on Aug. 9, keep it to yourself (if I hadn't been traveling betweenRio and Buenos Aires that day, I would have sold short and made 25 pointsin a few minutes). There will be many browsers, hundreds of them. Today,I'll bet on Niki Grauso's, which will come out in 37 languages. Browsersare the surface of a much deeper phenomenon. Sun Microsystems has it right:Java. Why? Because Java is a language and many smart people will expressthemselves and invent new applications in that language. Netscape is butone awning on the Virtual Boulevard of Digital Cafes. Java is the coffee.<BR><HR><H3>Andy Grove, President and CEO, Intel </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George--you haven't met a new technology you didn't like,and conversely you haven't met an older one that you don't think is readyto be toppled by the new. Do you remember when you wrote that &quot;specializedcomputers-to-a-chip will become the prevailing product category&quot;? Well,it didn't happen. Not that silicon compilers were back, not that ASICs areinsignificant, but the general-purpose computer that you pooh-poohed hasbecome the prevailing paradigm of the subsequent six years since the publicationof Microsm. Now you predict that the PC will become a peripheral attachedto an all-knowing, all-powerful Internet. I don't think so, George. Notthat the Internet won't be important; I look at it as one of the most importantapplications that will be used on my PC in the future. And that is the differencebetween us. What matters to me is my computer. I use my computer. I am usinga word processor to write this response; I use e-mail to communicate withhundreds of coworkers from my desk and from my home; I use CompuServe toget updated industry news; I use ProShare conferencing to do business withpartners across the world in real time. And I use Netscape to check outa new home page that I have hears about. A couple of years from now, I mayspend more time in the Net-based applications than in some of the others,just as today I spend my time differently among my applications than I didfive years ago. My computer will evolve and adapt (as PCs have been so goodat doing) to the ever-changing mix of applications with which I work. Youare wrong in another area. Implicit in so much of your writing is a fantasy:the notion of high-bandwidth communications reaching every PC. Today mycomputer is connected with ISDN to other computers; it is also connectedto LANs and to an ordinary phone line. Five years from now, my computerwill still be connected to an ordinary phone line and to ISDN, but alsoto broadband networks via a cable modem and to an ATM network to reach otherluck computer users; and probably to do some kind of wireless connection.Ten years from now, it will be another set of communications transport media.But it will never be a single superconnection, because goodness doesn'tarrive in a sing step. It comes a little at a time. To be sure, if God erasedall computers and networks and forced us to start from scratch, we wouldcertainly come a lot closer to your utopian view of broadband to the computer,with intelligence cleverly distributed between network and computers. Butthen, if God erased New York City, it would not be rebuilt the way it istoday. In real life, both cities and computer networks evolve, incrementby valuable increment. The bottom line is this: The magic of the PC businessis that there is a computer that I can look at, put my hands on and say,&quot;This computer is mine, and it opens the universe of tens of millionsof computers to me through its screen and keyboard--and whatever connectionscheme is available to me.&quot; Don't bury this magic; cherish it. <BR><HR><H3>Andy Kessler, Partner, Unterberg Harris </H3><BR><BR>Once again, my colleague and trendtender, George Gilder, has eloquentlyset forth the next wave of innovation. But in the process, the PC or clientdevice will not be hollowed out. Rather than living with fast servers andPCs acting as relatively dumb terminals, which is the architecture of Mosaicand the Web and even Java so far, the endgame is instead a network whereevery device is a server, even your own lousy PC. This means terribly intelligentand &quot;fat&quot; clients, enabling rather than just hanging off the network.Moreover, it is much too early to be handing out crowns to the new kingsof the network. George's trends are dead-on, but the kings are coronatedby natural selection, not by just showing up and claiming the throne. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen Manes, Columnist, New York Times, Author of Gates</H3><BR><BR><BR>Slow down, George! Sake's alive! Ma missed signs four and five! What sprangto mind upon reading Gilder's latest panegyric was not the rosey technologyfuture, but a Burma Shave ditty from my youth. I don't know Colombian beansabout Java, but I've been watching this industry too long not to reach formy methane detector when somebody announces in the language of corporatepropaganda that &quot;your computer will never be the same.&quot; This particularlocution almost always signifies too much time spent amid the rarefied gasesthat hove around chairmen and CEOs. A particularly toxic dose is to be suspectedwhen the proclaimed agent in change is an interpreted language. Interpretedlanguages have a long line of champions, not the least of whom is that greatBasic patron, William Henry Gates III (who seems less &quot;Archimdean&quot;than Charles Foster Kancan). But their magic has its limits, as Gates himselffound out when Microsoft developed its Multiplan spreadsheet on the interpretedruns-on-everything (but kinda slow) model and watched the compiled runs-on-DOS-only(but really fast) Lotus 1-2-3 force some massive recalculations at Microsoftheadquarters. Wasn't it only a few months ago that the press went gaga overGeneral Magic's interpreted Telescript, which now reportedly has, uh, someproblems? The runs-everywhere promise of interpreted languages generallymanages to get broken when it hits some Least Common Denominator--say, anotherLCD, the liquid crystal display. If you want to run Gilder's helicoptermodel on your crappy little Personal Digital Assistant, you may not haveto worry about having AutoCAD on your hard drive, but you probably willhave to worry about having a hard drive, not to mention a screen with enoughdetail and contrast to make the thing look vaguely like the original. TheIBM PC version of Multiplan was no prize, but it looked and felt great comparedwith the on that ran on the toy Commodore 64. Software is never truly independentof the hardware it runs on, interpreting programs tend to run with all thespeed of a tricycle, and bandwidth is still a long, long way from beingfree. <BR><HR><H3>Jesse Berst, Editor, Windows Watcher </H3><BR><BR>Mr. Gilder's article on the coming software shift is 10% fact and 90% wishfulthinking. Fact: Windows's dominance will come to an end when it is renderedirrelevant by a new platform. Wishful thinking: hoping the new platformwill be owned by somebody other than Microsoft. Gilder's fantasy of a Microsoft-freecomputer industry might come to pass if Bill Gates spent his time in hisvault counting his money. he doesn't He obsessively watches the horizonfor threats to his hegemony. When he spots a danger, he works feverishlyto use his current monopolies to leverage his way into the new arena. Hespotted the Internet danger about two years ago and has already spent morethan $100 million to make sure that Microsoft isn't left out. Yes, George,we will all eventually emigrate from the Windows desktop empire. But whenwe get to the new promised land, we're likely to find that Bill Gates hasalready acquired the prime real estate. Scott Cook, Chairman, Intuit Gilderchronicles invention like no other. He finds the history in the most recentevents. He finds the significance in invention before that significanceis real or realized. But Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future tellshow the innovations that reshape our lives follow their enabling inventionsby years or decades. Gutenberg invented movable type. It took another 40years for an entrepreneur named Aldus to assemble what created book publishingas we known it. Marconi invented radio exactly 100 years ago. It took another25 years for entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh and New York to create broadcasting.It was through broadcasting that radio reshaped our lives. None of us expectit will taken 25 years for this chapter of the Internet story. But I hopeGilder will tackle the next question: How will these inventions change ourlives? Gordon Bell, Research Fellow, Microsoft, Inventor of Digital VAXcomputer Telecosm, like microcosm, is another interesting Gilder story.Like transistors that follow Moore's Law, bandwidth increases at 60% peryear. The Gilder Fallacy is that transistors and bandwidth will also becheap. This may be true in the very long run, and I hope to live long enoughto see it. Meanwhile, the memory cartel has kept prices constant at $50per megabyte and the telephone cartel has metered out bits in 64 kilobitPOTS [plain old telephone service] = chunks for decades. For example, fullISDN lines (two voice lines) cost at least twice POTS. ISDN is also veryinelegant since it makes poor use of the precious last mile, and is notadequate or scaleable. Only modems, created by a new datacom industry, havegotten faster. My version of the Internet story is at http://www.uvc.com.It is called &quot;Internet 1.0 (Arpanet), 2.0 (today), and 3.0 (what weneed),&quot; subtitled: &quot;It's bandwidth and Symmetry, Stupid.&quot;In 1987, I chaired the cross-agency federal task force that proposed NREN[National Research and Education Network], aka NII [National InformationInfrastructure], aka GII [Global Information Infrastructure]. Our recommendationwas &quot;that an advanced network be designed and developed to interconnectacademic, industrial and government research facilities in the U.S.,&quot;with the plan for a factor of a ten thousandfold increase in bandwidth by2002. Things have gone according to our &quot;vision&quot; to maintain constantdoubling for the last 25 years. Thank goodness Berners-Lee created the http://wwwnetwork, aka the Web, so that Andreessen could build Mosaic and its viewers;that's the serendipity part. Public funding of research (this time at Illinois'National Center for Supercomputing Applications) &quot;saved&quot; us again.Intermixed in Gilder's piece is another story about a new Sun programminglanguage, Java, which when combined with the Web, will render Microsoftineffective. If that's the case, then Sun needn't support the anti-Microsoftlegal consortium and should concentrate on toppling it with their products.However, as a newly hired Microsoft researcher, anxious to work his waydown the corporate hierarchy to programmer, I hope that he's wrong aboutour undoing. Microsoft is its own greatest enemy if it fails to make everyproduct embrace the Internet. In an organization that has to keep with chaotichardware platform evolution, having an external standard and threat is thebest thing that could happen. Of the 50-plus million Word and PowerPointusers, however, perhaps 10,000 will see Java as an Internet developmenttool. More likely it's a tool for developing Internet tools. Word alreadyproduced HTML pages and PowerPoint should have the goal of being the mostused Internet content editor. I'll bet that Windows NT (created by DaveCutler, who also happens to be the world's greatest programmer) will becomethe &quot;standard&quot; server platform, just as the Wintel platform, likethe Gilders use, runs nearly all the viewers. As for staying in the centerof the sphere---Gilder's right: Andreessen's there, but I wouldn't countGates out . . . yet. <BR><HR><H3>Charles Mann, Contributing Editor, Atlantic Monthly </H3><BR><BR>The vision Mr. Gilder proposes is wonderfully attractive--who could notlike the idea of a future in which nobody has to struggle with the maddeninglimitations and incompatibilities of the PC? But the idea of plugging everyoneinto the Net for their work and play poses problems of its own, pride ofplace perhaps going to security. The number of Internet crackers and wannabecrackers is rising; worse, the very speed and ubiquity of the Net meansthat each new break-in technique becomes instantly available to all of them,as the spread of Root Kit an its analogues attests. Putting the whole worldonline will increase the opportunity for mischief enormously. At present,we have two basic means for fending off these guys--firewalls and encryption.Put crudely, firewalls are small computers that stand between you and theNet, scanning for unwanted incoming bits. (CheckPoint Software Technologiesin Israel, makes one of the more interesting examples). In one way or another,firewalls intercept and read parts of every Internet packet that comes yourway. If everyone's software is based somewhere &quot;out there&quot; onthe web, the computing power and bandwidth required to filter every screendump and rewrite through the firewall is interesting to contemplate. A worseproblem comes when the information is encrypted--how is the firewall toread it without decoding it? And if it does decode it, aren't you decodinginformation outside the intended recipient network? It's a problem. Forthis reason, most Net aficionados argue that some form of public-key encryptionis the answer. Leaving aside the extraordinary reserves of computing powerthat will be required to encrypt every bit of info going in and out of everysystem in the world--and the even more vexing question of who will pay forit, a subject on which I am not nearly as sanguine as Mr. Gilder--one hasto worry about the possibilities of breakthroughs such as those reportedrecently in Science, where researchers took advantage of the vagaries ofquantum mechanics to reduce the time required to factor large numbers enormously.Because encryption in its present form depends on the huge amount of timeit now takes to factor such numbers, these advances have dismaying implications.We could face a future in which advances in encryption and decoding raceeach other, Red Queen-style--hardly a situation favoring the confident useof a global network. Until these problems are resolved, they will be a bigdamper on the kind of bustling, productive, interconnected future that Mr.Gilder and I both hope is just around the corner. <BR><HR><H3>Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet Inventor and 3Corm Founder, <BR>InfoWorld Columnist </H3><BR><BR>To refind Gilder's model for how Gates gets dethroned, I'll briefly explainhow Gates made his billions. Gates came of age just as Grosch's Law aboutthe scale economies of bigger computers was giving way to Moore's Law aboutthe volume economies of smaller computers. Gates saw early and clearly theprofit potential in controlling standards, like the horizontal protocolstandards for communicating back and forth among computers, and like thevertical interface standards for communicating up and down between applicationssoftware and underlying computer operating systems software. I went withhorizontal protocol standards, namely Ethernet, which I advanced by givingit away to all other comers. Gates went with vertical interface standards,namely IBM's PC-DOS, which he advanced more shrewdly by giving it away toIBM but selling it to all comers. To build the value of PC-DOS, Gates gathereda huge flock of application software developers and got them committed tohis interface standards. Then by controlling changes to DOS's interfaces,upgrading them step-by-step all the way up to Windows 95, Gates was alsoable to sell them over and over again in upgraded forms. With that money,he could exploit inside knowledge of his own interface changes to pick offone after another of the larger application developers, like those in wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentations and, now, electronic mail and databases.His only major failure to date has been in networking, where he's failedso far to kill Novell. That failure involved control of Novell's protocolstandards rather than interface standards where Microsoft is king. Gildersays that Moore's Law is giving way to Metcalfe's Law, which projects therunaway value of numerous internetworked computers. According to Gilder'spoint of view, this exponential effect shifts importance from the verticalprogramming interface standards upon which the Redmond Rockefeller's fortuneis built to horizontal communication protocol standards which the likesof Marc Andreessen might be expected to dethrone Gates, perhaps becomingthe Microsoft of the Internet. But Gates, of course, aims to be the Microsoftof the Internet. And he need only broaden his tried-and-true interface strategyto include the protocols from the World Wide Web, now threatening his standardsdominance. Gates has the advantage of his current Windows monopoly, whichhe is now trying to leverage into control of the Web--let's hope our antitrustsheepdogs eventually arrive on the scene. Andreessen and company have thedisadvantage of coming from the virtuously open but fractious Unix world.Unless they can keep their Web standards act together, they will lose theWeb to the Windows Microsoft Network in the same way they lost Unix to DOS.MSN and Netscape will likely shape up to be the major opponents in the comingWeb Wars. MSN is making its play to replace Berners-Lee's Web standardswith its own under Blackbird. Microsoft is now giving away MSN browserslike Netscape and can be expected at some point to sell MSN servers andtools directly opposite Netscape's servers. Netscape, on the other hand,with its very busy Web pages is looking more and more like an on-line servicein competition with MSN, advertising and all. I must say that this battleis one that my InfoWorld readers will enjoy, as the fierce competition willdrive the Web toward its full potential. Gates doesn't need it, and certainlydoesn't expect it from me, but I do have to defend him. Andreessen and companyhave not yet made their billions, and they now look innocently charming,gregarious and eager, attractive compared with the shrewd and intense Mr.Gates. But, I've seen close up what even $1 million can do to people, andfrankly Gates handles his billions about as well as it is reasonable toexpect. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen S. Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. </H3><BR><BR>Gilder's gushing hype has finally come full circle. He has come to the keyrecognition that there's more to the information age than the alluring powerof Moore's Law. This time-worn mantra of a vendor-driven rhetoric extolsthe miracles of performance of payback--the productivity paradox wherebystartling advances in computational speed fail to deliver the value-addedsolutions that truly matter for society as a whole. But now Gilder heraldsa new &quot;killer app&quot; in user-friendly browsers and new &quot;minimalist&quot;programming languages such as Java. But don't count on it--at least notyet. In the fast-track 1990s, technology must still come to grips with aprofound upheaval in American lifestyles. For the first time ever, white-collarworkers--fully two-thirds of the U.S. workforce--are being asked to up theante of their own productivity contributions through longer and harder work,squeezing family and leisure time as never before in the last 50 years.Surfing the Net in a quest for the &quot;best&quot; application--and learninghow to use each of the new tools--takes considerable time. And that's therub: Time-intensive surfing is in direct conflict with the harsh realitiesof a time-constrained era. In the end, it all boils down to return. Theaverage U.S. worker who has toiled under the burden of stagnant real wagesfor more than a decade will insist on measurable improvements in personalproductivity before squandering ever-greater amounts of leisure and familytime on an open-ended journey on the telecosm. However alluring the latestbreakthroughs in electronic shopping, banking, and video selection may seemto be, my guess is that they don't meet the hurdle rate for the averageAmerican. That's the crux of the dilemma that Gilder still doesn't get:The promises of the telecosm will ring hollow until new means of incomegeneration and wealth creation for society as a whole are created. At best,a flexible software paradigm is merely another means to automate existingtasks. The big steps come with applications that truly change the functionsof work and leisure. And they have yet to be taken. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Ellison, Founder, CEO and Chairman, Oracle Systems Corp. </H3><BR><BR>I believe George has it half right. The center of gravity is indeed shiftingaway from the personal computer and toward the network--specifically towardthe Internet's World Wide Web. Despite the Clinton administration's mostdetermined regulatory efforts, networks are getting faster and cheaper.Various telecommunication bills pending in Congress will decrease regulation,increase competition and accelerate this trend. Cost and ease-of-use improvements,plus video capability, will make the World Wide Web as popular as the familiarTV and telephone networks for communication and commerce, as well as forinformation and entertainment. Bandwidth will expand exponentially and sowill the quality and quantity of information on the Net. The informationage will move from dawn to full daylight. And our world will be changed.But probably not by Netscape: Wall Street and Mr. Gilder are greatly charmedby he most exciting startup since 3DO, but it is important to remember thatNetscape's improbably $2.4 billion valuation comes without earnings or anyquick hope thereof. In the absence of any commercial competition, Netscapewas able to achieve a 70% =&quot;market share&quot; by distributing itsbrowser for free via the Internet. When a clearly superior Browser becomesavailable, people will replace their Netscape browser just the way theygot it--with the touch of a button. The most important new feature announcedfor a future version of the Netscape browser in Sun's hot new Java programminglanguage, which Sun is trying to make an open standard. We're all for it,but you don't get to be the next Microsoft by distributing Sun softwareand helping create open standards. You get to be Microsoft by creating yourown proprietary standard, while convincing everybody it's actually an openstandard. Fortunately, this trick usually works only once, so there willbe no new Microsoft. One is quite enough, thank you. Marc Andreessen isnot Bill Gates. It's probably possible to be great without being Bill. Butit takes a lot of work. Gates is the chairman of Microsoft, the CEO, itsfounder and the man who makes every key hiring decision. Andreessen is neitherchairman (that's Jim Clark), nor CEO (that's Jim Barksdale), but a hiredgun. Hired, in fact, by Jim Clark. History generally shows us only one Rockefellerper industry--the first one tends to get rid of future rivals. If a cosmicshift causes King Bill to lose his throne, it will not be filled by Andreessenor anybody else. There is no next Bill Gates--in software--at least. <BR><HR><H3>Steve Case, President and CEO, America Online </H3><BR><BR>I have a simple request: Let's not forget about the customer. A &quot;realitygap&quot; exists between technologists (breathlessly enchanted with thelatest and greatest revolutionary developments) and the mass consumer market(inevitably preferring evolutionary incrementalism). Invariably, developershave powerful workstations, superfast networks, and a certain affinity forcomplexity. Meanwhile, tens of millions of people out there struggle withmemory-deprived 386s, painfully slow modems (in the real world 14.4 kbpsis considered pretty fast, and 28.8 kbps is the promised land), and a tremendousthirst for simplicity. Yes, telephone companies are getting more aggressivewith ISDN pricing and marketing, and developers are reaching for plug-and-playsolutions, but it's still too hard and still too expensive. Yes, cable companiesare testing cable modems, but the tests are going slowly and broad deploymentis likely to take many years. Switching gears to software, Gilder embracesthe commonly held notion that Netscape's browser is the standard, commandinga dominant (&quot;70%&quot;) market share. But all of the commercial on-lineservices now provide Web access, and they have overnight become the dominantforce in the consumer Web. Neither of the two largest existing players (AOLand CompuServe), nor the most significant entrant (Microsoft), are Netscape'slicensees, so Netscape's market share is therefore zero in this emergingsegment. The already fragmented Web market is likely to get even more fragmented,creating havoc for publishers and confusion for consumers. Ultimately, theservices with the largest audiences will drive standardization. So whenI read about the &quot;dynamically portable&quot; Java, linked with theNetscape browser &quot;standard&quot; and coupled with a &quot;bandwidthtidal wave,&quot; leading a &quot;telecosmic advance&quot; towards a worldchock-full of custom applets filled with tasty morsels of &quot;executablecontent,&quot; Exciting, but I wonder how -- and when -- it will all cometogether into a mass market for interactive services. People don't buy browsers.They don't buy objects. They don't buy bandwidth. They buy services. Theywant access to a broad range of content, packaged and presented in a friendly,useful, engaging manner, priced simply and affordably, with a strong underlyingsense of community. At AOL, our aim is to reach tens of millions of peopleand help shape this new medium. We will continue to leverage technologyto do -- but we'll also remind ourselves that although technologists believethe journey is the reward, for everybody else, the destination is what reallycounts. <BR><HR><H2><CENTER>George Gilder Replies: </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>When the responses to an article exceed the original in pith and pertinence,the writer may be tempted merely to step back, point and applaud. However,at the risk of revealing Forbes ASAP trade secrets, I will correct the impressionthat I am some kind of sappy seersucker who gets his information from dotingCEOs, perhaps in the telephone and TV industries. In fact, much to the irritationof the PR firms surrounding large companies, I invariably rely mostly onengineers, programmers and other technologists and consult the imperialsuits chiefly en route to the illuminati in the nether reaches of theircompanies. <BR><BR><BR>As Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has noticed with some impatience, I alsogive short shrift to the kind of macrovisions, strategies and statisticsthat float up to the top of economic models. These data are too light onthe technical details in which reside the angels and devils of industrialdestiny. For example, Roach remains perplexed by the &quot;productivityparadox,&quot; the lack of evident payoff of information tools, the failuresof the industry to surmount the hurdle rates of humbler households, allin the face of some 60 million worldwide prospective PC sales in 1995, exceedingTV unit sales in the U.S., with e-mail passing the U.S. Postal Service inmessage units. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are capturing some 50% of all theprofits of the industrial world and maintaining market share between 60%and 90% in most leading-edge products, while deploying three times as muchcomputer power per capita as either Europe or Japan. <BR><BR><BR>Roach trusts government productivity data and wage levels more than thedemonstrable achievements of U.S. companies and calls the conflict a portentousparadox. I say that both the wage and productivity data are largely bunkum,based on silly deflators that mostly fail to capture the plummeting pricesin the industry, while U.S. leadership in PCs, peripherals, networks andsoftware is the real payoff. PC companies alone have generated some $250billion in market caps over the last decade; Internet companies will generatetrillions. These bonanzas answer all the questions on hurdle rates and socialyields (though if you want to see some real high-speed hurdling in homes,wait until cable modems proliferate next year). The payoff of informationtechnology is the global leadership of the U.S. economy despite appallingpolicy mistakes from the Bush and Clinton administrations. <BR><BR><BR>Like me, Andy Grove likes to wrangle and I hesitate to deny him his pugilisticjollies. Among the new technologies I did not like from the outset are HDTV,interactive TV, TV shopping, game machines, Japanese fifth-generation computers,NMOS, videophones, flash memories, serial Crays, Thinking Machines, 3DOand pencentric PDAs. But perhaps we can make a deal. I will concede to himand Andy Kessler that the use of the term &quot;hollowing out of the computer,&quot;borrowed from the estimable Eric Schmidt of Sun, is hyperbolic, even misleadingin an absolute sense. But they should acknowledge that in relative terms,the balance between desktop and network is shifting sharply. After all,in five out of the six PC uses Grove cites, most of the value originateson the network. Nonetheless, I do cherish the PC; indeed, using the Internet,I believe it will displace both the telephone and television over the nextfive years or so.<BR><HR><BR><H4><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="177"HEIGHT="54" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>

&quot;I was trying to conceive of how one could approach it in a way that
would be fundamental . . . like being at the center of a sphere, where there
were opportunities--and problems, of course!--in all directions.&quot; <BR>

<HR>What will it take to launch a new Bill Gates--an Archimedean man who
sharply shifts the center of the sphere, alters the axes of technology and
economy, and builds a new business empire on new foundations? Who can inherit
the imperial throne in the microcosm and telecosm currently held by the
Redmond Rockefeller? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will open the envelope in a minute. But first I want to tell you about
a new software program called Netscape Navigator Personal Edition. I brought
it back from Silicon Valley in late June and put the package next to my
PC. The PC was proudly running a beta version of Windows 95. I had presented
Windows 95 with great fanfare to my 11-year-old son Richard as his route
to the most thrilling new frontiers of the computer world. Multitasking,
32-bit operation, flat memory! Object linking and embedding! &quot;Information
at your fingertips!&quot; But, all in all, he preferred his Mac Quadra 840AV
or even Windows 3.1. They don't crash so often, he explained. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live out in the boondocks of western Massachusetts where there are no
convenient full-service connections to the Internet. So I was much less
excited about Netscape than I was about Windows 95. I hoped Windows 95 would
put me on line through the Microsoft Network system. Some 10 minutes later,
though, Richard wanted to know my credit car number so I could choose an
Internet service provider. A couple of minutes after that, linked through
internetMCI's 800 number, Richard was on the World Wide Web, using the InfoSeek
service to examine my chapters from Telecosm on line, searching the secrets
of Sim City 2000 at Maxis, exchanging messages with Microsoft Flight Simulator
buffs, and exploring Disney. As far as I know, he is still there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, my brother Walter came by. He worked for a computer
company, New World Technologies in Ashland, Mass., that builds customized
Pentium machines and delivers them to value-added resellers within 48 hours.
Walter wanted the Netscape program. He took it back to my parents' farm
down the road and booted it up on a four-megabyte 386SX Dynatech previously
used to map the pedigrees of a flock of Romney sheep. Soon he was on the
Web scouting out the competition from Dell and Micron and showing off the
Gilder Web page. This intrigued my 77-year-old mother, who had scarcely
even noticed a computer before. I don't know how it happened, but before
the night was out, she too was on the Web, exploring catalogs of British
colleges for her namesake granddaughter who was soon to leave for London.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let me tell you about my introduction to Java, a new programming language
that menaces Microsoft's software supremacy. I encountered Java in early
June at a Sun Microsystems conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
downtown San Francisco. For a speech I was to give, I had planned to use
a multimedia presentation, complete with Macro-Mind Director images and
QuickTime video that I had contrived with an expensive professional some
months earlier. The complexities of Director prompted me to convert the
program to Astound. However, it required an external disk drive and ran
erratically with the eight megabytes of RAM on my PowerBook. I decided to
speak nakedly from notes on the coming technologies of sand and glass and
air. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following me immediately to the stage was Sun's amiable chief scientist,
John Gage. He decided to illustrate his speech entirely from the World Wide
Web. He began with a handsome page, contrived minutes before, giving an
account of my speech, headlined: &quot;Gilder Addresses Sun, Tells of Technologies
of Opaque Silicon and Transparent Silicon.&quot; Then he moved to the Gilder
Telecosm archives run by Gordon Jacobson of Portman Communications at a
Web site of the University of Pennsylvania's engineering school. Gage illustrated
his talk with real-time reports on traffic conditions in San Diego (where
I was about to go), weather conditions in Florida as a hurricane loomed,
and developments on Wall Street as IBM bid for Lotus. He showed the Nasdaq
ticker running across the screen. He showed animations of relevant charts,
cute little Java gymnasts cartwheeling across the screen, three-dimensional
interactive molecular models and an overflowing coffee cup, entitled &quot;HotJava.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
None of his information and images used a desktop presentation program,
whether from MacroMind or from Microsoft. None of them used a database engine,
whether SQL or Oracular. Indeed, except for the Gilder speech report, none
were created beforehand. Incurring no memory or disk drive problems, Gage
summoned all the illustrations to his PowerBook directly from the Internet.
The animations employed a new computer language, Java, written for the Web
by the venerable Sun programmer James Gosling. Java allows transmission
of executable programs to any computer connected to the Net to be interpreted
and played safely and securely in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clifford Stoll, calls it &quot;Silicon snake oil.&quot; But I call it a
fundamental break in the history of technology. It is the software complement
of the hollowing out of the computer described in Forbes ASAP (&quot;The
Bandwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December 5, 1994). Almost overnight, the CPU
and its software have become peripheral; the network, central. I had spent
working on a presentation on my desktop computer, using an array of presentation
software. But Gage improvised a more impressive and animated presentation
without using any desktop presentation programs at all. The World Wide Web
and the Java language were enough. Restricted to the files of my computer,
I struggled with storage problems and incompatible research formats, while
he used the storage capacity and information resources of more than five
million host computers on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly for my family, the limitations of my parents' barnyard four-megabyte
386SX didn't matter. The operating system also didn't matter. What was crucial
was the network gear and software. My brother Walter had installed a modem
that linked to the Web at an average of 24.6 kilobits per second. With the
Netscape Navigator, that was enough. Actually 14.4 would have been enough.
Enough to launch a new Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Admit it, the legacy version, once so luminous, is beginning to lose its
shine. You thrill no longer at his vaporware $50 million house, fenestrated
with $40 billion Windows, offering misty views of Daytona, Memphis, Cairo,
and other far-off places you no longer really care to go, even if--OLE--they
are swimming with GML 3D screensavers from London's National Gallery endlessly
hurdling the 640K barrier as if it were flat as a Mac. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the most essential level, Bill Joy of Sun illuminated Gates's dilemma
at Esther Dyson's PC Forum conference in 1990. Known as one of the great
minds in software, yet losing share inexorably to Microsoft, Joy seemed
to be moving into the role of conference crank. Year after year, he lamented
the prolix inelegance of the triumphant waves of Microsoft programs sweeping
through the industry: &quot;As we add more and more of these features to
older systems,&quot; he said, &quot;the complexity gets multiplicative.
I have 10 different packages that interact in 10-to-the-10th different ways.
I get all sorts of surprises, and yet because these things don't play together
well the power is only additive. I get this feature and that feature but
the combinations don't work. What I'd really like to see is a system where
the complexity goes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In software, complexity has long been rising exponentially, while power
has been rising additively. In response, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of
Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's
Laws for software: &quot;Software expands to fill the available memory,&quot;
and &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster.&quot;
Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their
previous releases. Compare Word 6.0 for the Mac, for example, with Word
5.0 or WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows with WordPerfect for DOS. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But none of this matters. Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly
exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the
Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every
18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.
The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on
the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates travels in the slipstream behind Moore's Law, following a key rule
of the microcosm: Waste transistors. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, &quot;Every
time Andy [Grove] makes a faster chip, Bill uses all of it.&quot; Wasting
transistors is the law of thrift in the microcosm, and Gates has been its
most brilliant and resourceful exponent. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, in the face of Gates's ascendancy, Bill Joy seemed to grow curls
and shed influence, as Sun played rope-a-dope with Hewlett-Packard and other
workstation rivals. In 1990, he retreated to a sylvan aerie in Aspen, Colo.,
to pursue &quot;advanced research&quot; for Sun. But his talk of small programs
and handheld consumer appliances seemed irrelevant to the company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, in early 1990, showing up late--in a Hawaiian shirt--to address
a formal dinner in Silicon Valley, Bill Joy had a great prophetic moment.
He cited the Moore's Law trends as grounds for granting the first five years
of the 1990s to Bill Gates. &quot;It's pretty much determined,&quot; he
said. Indeed, in the late 1980s, Joy had personally made a separate peace
with Microsoft by selling a large portion of his Sun holdings and buying
Microsoft shares, thus becoming the second richest of Sun's four founders.
(The richest, Andy Bechtolsheim, jumped even deeper into Microsoft.) But
then, around 1995, predicted Joy, everything would change. There would be
a &quot;break-through that we cannot imagine today.&quot; He even acknowledged
that the breakthrough would not come from Sun, but &quot;from people and
companies we cannot know today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to software innovation, he said, was smart programmers. Smart programmers
are hundreds of times more productive than ordinary programmers. And &quot;let's
be truthful,&quot; said the sage of Sun, propounding what has become known
as Joy's Law, &quot;most of the bright people don't work for you--no matter
who you are. You need a strategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere.&quot;
To the Justice Department, Microsoft's overwhelming OS market share and
its teeming armies of programmers seem a barrier to entry for other software
competitors. To Joy, Microsoft's size and dominance could become a barrier
to entry for Microsoft, blocking it from the key new markets of the late
1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is now clear that Joy was on target. The breakthrough is here in force,
invading and occupying all the commanding heights of the information economy,
from the media to the universities. It is the World Wide Web and its powerful
browsers, servers, languages and programming tools. Software on individual
machines still bogs down in the macrocosmic swamps of complexity. But in
the telecosm, yields rise exponentially almost without limit in proportion
to the number and power of the machines on the network. No matter how much
memory and other storage is created on the desktop, no matter what information
resources are assembled on CD-ROMs, no matter how powerful are the database
tools created for the LAN, the desktop imperium will pale and wither before
the telecosmic amplitudes of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, the number of machines on the network has been
rising between five and 10 times faster than the number of transistors on
a chip. With 1,300 miles of fiber-optic lines being laid every day in the
U.S., band-width is sure to rise even faster than the number of networked
computers (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The Bankwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December
5, 1994). This awesome transition presents a supreme chance for new leadership
in developing software focused less on wasting transistors than on wasting
bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A computer on every desktop and in every home? Information at your fingertips?
SQL Server 6.0? My son Richard yawns. Let's face it, Bill, that stuff is
yesterday. In the new era, Microsoft cant continue to feed on the microcosm.
But the leading-edge companies will move to the frontiers of the telecosm,
where collectively they will grow far faster than Microsoft. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, open the envelope. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's find a new Bill Gates. Start by adding 100 pounds of extra heft, half
a foot of height and two further years of schooling, then make him $12.9
billion hungrier. Give him a gargantuan appetite for pizza and Oreos, Bach,
newsprint, algorithms, ideas, John Barth, Nabokov, images, Unix code, bandwidth.
Give him a nearly unspellable Scandinavian name--Marc Andreessen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Put him to work for $6.85 per hour at Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) writing 3D visualization code on a Silicon Graphics
Indy for a Thinking Machine C-5 or a Cray YMP16. Surround him on all sides
by the most advanced computers and software in the world, under the leadership
of cybernetic visionary Larry Smarr. What will happen next? &quot;Boredom,&quot;
Andreessen replies. Supercomputers, already at the end of their tether,
turned out to be &quot;underwhelming Unix machines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then, for a further image of the end of the world, take him in the fall
of 1990 off to Austin, Tex., for two semesters at IBM. &quot;They were going
to take over the 3D graphics market, they were going to win the Malcolm
Baldridge Award, they were going to blow Silicon Graphics [the regnant Silicon
Valley 3D workstation company] off the map, all in six months.&quot; Andreessen
began by doing performance analysis and moved on to work on the operating
system kernel. In mid-1991, after constant delays, the company was finally
ready to ship a world-beating 3D engine. But the new IBM machine turned
out to be four times slower at seven times the price of the equivalent Silicon
Graphics hardware that IBM had bundled a year and a half earlier with its
RS6000 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) workstation. Austin IBM
returned to the drawing board and Andreessen returned to Illinois to get
his degree. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In both commercial and academic settings, Andreessen thus had the good fortune
of working at the very heard of the old order of computing in its climactic
phase. As Andreessen saw it, little of long-term interest was going on at
either establishment. But both did command one huge and felicitous resource,
vastly underused, and that was the Internet. &quot;Designed for all the
wrong reasons--to link some 2,000 scientists to a tiny number of supercomputers,&quot;
it had exploded into a global ganglion thronged by millions of people and
machines. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many people saw the Internet as throbbing with hype and seething with problems--Clifford
Stoll's book, Silicon Snake Oil, catalogs many: the lack of security, substance,
reliability, bandwidth, easy access; the presence of porn, fraud, frivolity
and freaks guarantees, so he says, that no serious business can depend on
it for critical functions. But to Andreessen the problems of the Internet
are only the other side of its incredible virtues. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;By usual standards,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;the Internet was
far from perfect. But the Internet finds its own perfection--in the millions
of people that are able to use it and the hundreds of thousands who can
provide services for it.&quot; To Andreessen, all the problems signaled
that he was at the center of the sphere, gazing in wild surmise at &quot;a
giant hole in the middle of the world&quot;--the supreme opportunity of
the age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen saw that, for all its potential, there was a monstrous incongruity
at the heart of the Internet. Its access software was at least 10 years
behind. &quot;PC Windows had penetrated all the desktops, the Mac was a
huge success, and point-and-click interfaces had become part of everyday
life. But to use the Net you still had to understand Unix. You had to type
FTP [file transfer protocol] commands by hand and you had to be able to
do addressmapping in your head between IP addresses and host names and you
had to know where all the FTP archives were' you had to understand IRC [Internet
relay chat] protocols, you had to know how to use this particular news reader
and that particular Unix shell prompt, and you pretty much had to know Unix
itself to get anything done. And the current users had little interest in
making it easier. In fact, there was a definite element of not wanting to
make it easier, of actually wanting to keep the riffraff out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The almost miraculous key to opening up the Internet was the concept of
hypertext, invented by Theodor Holm Nelson, the famously fractious prophet
of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; network, and son of Celeste Holm, the actress.
A hypnotic speaker, with a gaunt countenance and flowing golden hair, Nelson
seems an Old Testament Jeremiah from Central Casting as he rails against
the flaws and foibles of current-day computing. Hypertext is simply text
embedded with pointers to other text, instantly and full available by a
point and click. For the source of the concept, Nelson quotes an essay by
Vannevar Bush written in 1945 and read to him by his father as a boy: &quot;The
human mind . . . operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it
snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of
the brain.&quot; Projecting this idea from a single human brain to a global
ganglion, Nelson sowed the conceptual seeds of the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen can explain both the power of hypertext and its slow emergence
in commercial products: &quot;Xanadu was just a tremendous idea. But hypertext
depends on the network. If the network is there, hypertext is incredibly
useful. It is the key mechanism. But if the network is not there, hypertext
does not give you any of the richness.&quot; Hence, Apple's HyperCard and
similar schemes failed to ignite. The link is not hyper if it is restricted
to your hard drive or CD-ROM. Connected to millions of computers around
the globe, it becomes exponentially hyper. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The other thing about hypertext,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;is that,
even on networks, traditionally it had been developed by theoreticians and
people very deep in the computer science community, and they tended to worry
very deeply about problems like, 'Well, what happens if the information
moves?'&quot; As Gates put it in 1992: &quot;The idea of locating things
that move by their properties and dealing with the security and efficiency
issues, including using replication to do this stuff well, is a very tough
problem. That's what Windows's Cairo is all about. Three or four Ph.D. theses
talk about this, but a commercial system has never done it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen brings the issue down to earth: &quot;You've got a pointer at
a piece of information on the network, but Joe, who's running that information,
moves it somewhere else. Computer scientists would take a look at the problem
and say, 'Oh, the system doesn't work.' On the Internet, we look at that
problem and say, 'Oh well, here's another 20,000 pointers that do work.'
And may be we can send e-mail to Joe and he'll put his information back.&quot;
In other words, you don't wait for Cairo or Xanadu to try to solve every
problem. You go with the fabulous flow of opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's idea led to what Gary Wolf, a contributing writer of Wired, calls
&quot;one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century&quot;--a universal
library, a global information index and a computerized royalty system. But
Nelson's quest for perfection led to a 20-year adventure in futility. &quot;The
opinion of the Xanadu people to this day is that the Web and the Internet
are much too simple. They don't solve the problems. For instance, the links
aren't fully bidirectional. You don't know exactly who's pointing to your
page, and there's two ways to look at that. The way that Ted Nelson looks
at it is 'That's bad!' The way I look at it is 'That's great!' All of a
sudden anyone can point to your page without permission. The Net can grow
at its own rate. You get the network effect, you get Metcalfe's Law, it
spirals completely out of control. Isn't that fantastic?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1988, Xanadu found funding from John Walker, the charismatic recluse,
taxpatriate in Switzerland, and founder of Autodesk, the desktop computer-aided
design (CAD) company. As Walker prophetically declared in 1988: &quot;In
1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal
of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product.
And by 1995, it will begin to change the world.&quot; All truer than Walker
could have imagined, but it would not happen, alas, at Autodesk. Haunted
by dreams of perfection and hobbled by hyperventilation at the helm, Xanadu
misted over. Autodesk sustained the effort until it was mercifully terminated
by the new CEO, Carol Bartz, in 1993 at the very moment that a real Xanadu,
deemed hopelessly imperfect and inadequate by Nelson, was about to burst
forth efflorescently on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demiurgic step came from Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, creating
the World Wide Web based on a universal hypertext function. He launched
initial HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) governing transport on the Web.
He developed URLs (uniform resource locators) as a common addressing system
that joined most of the existing Internet search and linkage technologies.
He conceived the HTML (hypertext markup language), a kind of PostScript
for the Web. He made the system ignore failures (Joe's moving data could
not crash your machine). Thus, invoking a browser (i.e., a hypertext reader),
the user could point and click to information anywhere on the Net, unconscious
of whether it was in the form of a file transfer, an e-mail, a Gopher search
or a news posting, or whether it was in the next room or in Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Berners-Lee addressed a basic problem of the Internet from the point of
view of an academic researcher. But the real opportunity was to open the
Internet to the world and the world to the Internet, and that would require
more than a facility for cruising through textual materials. After all,
the bulk of human bandwidth is in a person's eyes and ears. For absorbing
text, as Robert Lucky, author of Silicon Dreams, has pointed out, the speed
limit is only some 55 bits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To burst open the Internet would require reaching out to the riffraff who
travel through pictures and sounds at megahertz speeds. To critics of a
more vulgar Net, such as Stoll, more riffraff sending a callipygian naked-lady
bitmaps and voluminous digital ululations from the Grateful Dead and QuickTime
first-step baby videos traipsing down the lines and wriggling through the
routers would soon cause a gigantic crash. Even some of Andreessen's main
allies at the NCSA shared some of these fears. At CERN, Berners-Lee opposed
images and video on these grounds. The technologists all held a narrowband
view of the world, imagining bandwidth as an essentially scarce resource
to be carefully husbanded by responsible citizens of the cybersphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Tim Berners-Lee alone could not burst open the Internet pi&ntilde;ata
and give it to the world. As Richard Wiggins, author of Internet for Everyone:
A Guide for Users and Providers, observes, &quot;During 1992 and early 1993,
graphical Gopher clients for the Macintosh and Windows evolved, and it appeared
that Gopher would outstrip the fledgling Web.&quot; It was the ultimate
broadband booster, Marc Andreessen, working with NCSA colleague Eric Bina,
who ignited the Web rocket. One late December night in 1992 at the Espresso
Royale cafe in Champaign-Urbana, Andreessen looked his friend Eric Bina
in the eye and said: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every Gates has to have his Paul Allen (or Jobs, his Steve Wozniak). Andreessen's
is Bina--short and wiry where Andreessen is ursine, cautious where he is
cosmic, focused where he is expansive, apprehensive where he is evangelical,
bitwise where he is prodigal with bandwidth, ready to stay home and write
the code where Andreessen is moving on to conquer the globe. Wildly contrasting
but completely trusting and complementary, these two--in an inspired siege
of marathon code-wreaking between January and March 1993--made Mosaic happen.
A rich image-based program for accessing the World Wide Web and other parts
of the Internet, Mosaic requires no more knowledge of its internal mechanics
than is needed by the user of the steering wheel of a car. With a mere 9,000
lines of code (compared to Windows 95's 11 million lines, including 3 million
lines of MSN code), Mosaic would become the most rapidly propagated software
program ever written. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen could defy all the fears of an Internet image crash because he
lived in a world of bandwidth abundance and fiber galore. He fully grasped
the law of the telecosm. Every new host computer added to the Net would
not only use the Net; it would also be a new resource for it, providing
a new route for the bits and new room to store them. Every new flood of
megabyte bitmaps would make the Net more interesting, useful and attractive,
and increase the pressure for backbones running at gigabits per second and
above. The Internet must be adapted to people with eyes and ears. They won't
abuse it, he assured Bina without a smile. After all, he knew he would have
to rely on Bina for much of the graphics coding. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was right,&quot; Bina says now. &quot;People abused it horribly.
People would scan in a page of PostScript text in a bitmap, taking over
a megabyte to display a page that would take maybe 1,000 bytes of text.
But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands
of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information
on the Web, and millions of people use it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working night and day at the NCSA, wrangling over issues, arts and letters,
music and Unix code at the Espresso Royale down the street, the two programmers
achieved a rare synergy. &quot;We each did the job that most appealed to
us,&quot; says Bina, &quot;so each of us thinks the other did the hard stuff.&quot;
Bina wrote most of the new code--in particular, the graphics, modifying
HTML to handle images, adding a GIF (graphics interchange format) decoder,
incorporating color management tools. Andreessen took the existing library
of communications code from CERN and tore it apart and rewrote it so it
would run more quickly and efficiently on the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As time passed, they brought in other young programmers from the NCSA--among
them Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Chris Houck and Aleks Totic--to port
the system to Windows and Mac machines. With help from them, they designed
dynamic forms with type-in fields, check boxes, toggle buttons and other
ordered ways of entering simple text for searches and other functions, beyond
simple hypertext pointing at a URL. For example, a dynamic form is now used
by Pizza Hut for ordering a pizza on line. Finally, because every change
in the browser required complementary changes in the servers at CERN--where
the physicists tended to be busy and glitz-averse--Bina and Andreessen decided
to do their own servers. The NCSA's Rob McCool took charge of this crucial
project. I<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
n the end, they had created an entirely new interface for the Internet and
new communications software to render it crisply accessible--a look and
feel that almost immediately struck everyone who used it as an amazing breakthrough.
In February 1995, Bob Metcalfe wrote a column in InfoWorld predicting that
Web browsers would become, in effect, the dominant operating system for
the next era. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browsers are now ubiquitous. Every major company and many minor ones are
building them. Some eight million people use them. IBM, AT&amp;T, Novell,
Microsoft, NetCom, Sun, Silicon Graphics, America Online, Net-Manage, Quarterdeck,
Quadralay, Apple, SPRY-CompuServe, Frontier Technologies, Delphi, MCI, Wollongong,
even the Spyglass spinoff from the NCSA--you name it--all these companies
are building, licensing, enhancing or bundling a browser. Many of these
ventures, led by Quarterdeck's smart hotlists and &quot;drag-and-drop&quot;
ease of use, have outpaced Mosaic and prompted a leapfrogging contest of
can-you-top-this. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what happens when an entrepreneur performs a truly revolutionary
act, supplies the smallest missing factor, as Peter Drucker puts it, that
can transform a jumble of elements into a working system--the minimal mutation
that provokes a new paradigm. In 1977, the relevant jumble was small computers,
microprocessors and assembly language programming. Bill Gates and Paul Allen
supplied the key increment: software tools and the Basic language for the
embryonic personal computer. In 1993, Andreessen and Bina set out to supply
the minimal increment to convert the entire Net, with its then one to two
million linked computers (today it's an estimated seven million computers)
and immense information resources, into a domain as readily accessible to
an 11-year-old as a hard drive or CD-ROM on a Mac or Windows PC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the same forces of exploding bandwidth, the same laws of the
telecosm that are wreaking revolution in hardware, hollowing out the computer--rendering
the CPU peripheral and the network central--are also transforming software.
All forms of desktop software--operating systems, applications and utilities--are
becoming similarly peripheral. The ever-growing gigapedal resources of the
Internet will always dwarf any powers and functions that can be distilled
on a desktop or mobilized on the backplane of a supercomputer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, for example, four researchers at MIT, Iowa State, Bellcore and
Oxford (U.K.) triumphantly claimed a $100 reward for solving a grand challenge
problem. They announced that they had broken an RSA encryption code of 129
digits that one of RSA's inventors, R.L. Rivest, when offering the $100
prize in 1977, calculated would take four quadrillion years for a supercomputer
to crack. They did not accomplish their feat on a single machine (none yet
exists that can perform these computations) but on a virtual machine consisting
of 1,600 mostly modest workstations scattered around the Internet. Similarly,
Gordon Bell in 1992 for the first time granted his achievement award for
price and performance in the application of supercomputers, not to a single
machine, but to a distributed Internet virtual system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Internet model even in these high-powered processing
applications portends and symbolizes a definitive reality, which gathers
increasing force as network bandwidth begins to exceed the internal bandwidth
on computer backplanes. From now on, the relevant computer is the network
and the ascendant software is Internet software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving the program away on the Net, Andreessen released Mosaic in binary
form, already compiled for any popular computer platform, and helped bring
more than a million newcomers to the Web in six months. In that time, such
an upheaval would even reach the notice of the management of the NCSA. At
the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C., a friend eagerly showed
Mosaic to Larry Smarr, who was visiting from Illinois. He was startled to
see that this new marvel was a creation of his own shop at the NCSA. Perhaps
he should look into it. Perhaps there was more to sell to Washington than
Fiber Channels between scientists and Crays. From that moment on, pushing
Mosaic became the chief &quot;grand challenge problem&quot; of the University
of Illinois Supercomputing Center. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After Andreessen's college graduation in December 1993, Joseph Hardin, head
of the NCSA, asked him to stay on at the center. But he added one condition,
namely, that the young programmer leave the Mosaic project. &quot;Some 40
people had a role in creating Mosaic,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't you think
it's time to give someone else a chance to share the glory?&quot; Reasoning
that they would have a still better chance in his absence, Andreessen left
for Silicon Valley. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After a few months doing Internet security functions at a company called
EIT, Andreessen attracted the attention of the legendary Jim Clark, founder
of Silicon Graphics Inc. and inventor of the Geometry Engine, capable of
3D graphics, that impelled SGI's growth. At loose ends, like most of the
industry's venturers, Clark was looking for opportunity in all the wrong
places--3D games, interactive TV, Hollywood. He found himself increasingly
entranced with the Mosaic browser. Hearing that the author of Mosaic had
arrived in Silicon Valley, he sent Andreessen an e-mail in early February
1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rest is history, in the accelerated from familiar in the Valley. Jim
Clark met with Andreessen and signed him up as the first employee of a new
company. &quot;What has happened to the other NCSA programmers?&quot; he
wanted to know. Hearing that Chris Wilson, who had helped port the system
to the PC, had left the center to join SPRY, Clark decided to act fast.
He invited Bina to come to Silicon Valley and meet with him on his yacht.
Avoiding temptation (Bina's wife was a tenured professor of database technology
at Champaign-Urbana and is wary of snake oil), Bina spurned the invitation.
Andreessen wrote him a glum e-mail: &quot;Sorry. It would have been nice
to have had you here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing Bina knew, Andreessen called him to announce that he and
Clark were flying to Champaign-Urbana and wanted to meet with Bina and the
rest of the key programmers the next day at the local University Inn. &quot;When
I got off the elevator at the hotel,&quot; Bina recalls, &quot;this blond
guy who reminded me of my dad stepped back, looked me slowly up and down,
and spoke: 'Marc said you could walk on water. I have never seen anyone
who could do that before.'&quot; Clark soon assured him he could stay in
Illinois. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to Bina, Clark spread a contagion of entrepreneurial excitement.
Then one by one he made seven of them offers. All signed up. By the first
week of April, Mosaic software was on the way and Jim Clark forgot about
interactive TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Greeting this bold new company, however, were rumblings about a possible
intellectual property suit from the NCSA. This surprise banished any idea
of using Mosaic in any form. That was fine with them. They knew Mosaic was
a quickly written hack designed for T1 and T3 lines running at up to 45
megabits a second at the NCSA. &quot;We knew that everyone had Mosaic,&quot;
says Bina. &quot;We were glad to start from scratch again.&quot; Moving
into a small office in Mountain View at a cost of less than $1 per square
foot, they set to work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the new company, then called Mosaic Communications, Andreessen ascended
to management. Bina, working in Illinois for all but one frenzied week a
month, immersed himself in creating the new code. They revised it to work
over a 14.4 modem. They focused on making it the only system that is fully
secure. They added new supports for more elegant layouts and richer documents.
Giving the program away on the Net, within a few months Netscape won 70%
of the Web browser market, which it still holds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important for the future of the company, they developed a stream of
new server products, which they sold to most of the existing and aspiring
on-line services and Internet service providers, from internetMCI and marketplaceMCI
to IBM's Prodigy and Murdoch's Delphi. Altogether, they had released a total
of 11 new products by midsummer of this year, from $50,000 secure server
applications to the $39 Netscape Navigator Personal Edition complete with
TCP/IP stack for full connection to the Internet in 10 minutes anywhere
in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street began pouring money on any rival company with an Internet
Product, the stock market became a Netscape imperative. This posed a problem
from Clark. There would be no difficulty attracting a frenzy of interest.
The question was, Where would they hide Andreessen during the road show?
Introducing him to John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and
other Silicon Valley clout, however, Clark instead resolved to teach the
young bear how to chew with his mouth closed, tie a tie and get to work
earlier than 8:30 . . . p.m. Then he prepared to place him in the nose cone
of an Initial Public Orbiting that would value the gang at hundreds of millions
of dollars, point Andreessen towards the Millenium and, with luck and the
right characterological chemistry, have a new Bill Gates for the late 1990s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is, well after 8 p.m., roaring down El Camino Real in his '94 red
Mustang, filled with pizza rinds, empty cans of Sprite, a mostly shredded
copy of the San Jose Mercury News and a bulging issue of MicroTimes smeared
in popcorn butter, talking with both hands to a writer from Forbes ASAP
hunched amid the clutter and stealthily searching for a seat belt. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly free of the NIH (not invented here) syndrome afflicting many of
his elders--his browser combines products from some 17 sources--Andreessen
was discoursing on the virtues of Java, a language he says portends a telecosmic
advance even more profound and enduring than the browser and related servers
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For creating innovative stuff on the Web, Andreessen explains, &quot;The
alternative languages are grim, Perl is limited to text strings. Telescript
from General Magic doesn't pass because it's proprietary. Tickle [Tcl] lacks
power and features. Scheme and LISP are dead. Visual Basic lacks expressiveness
and it is too much controlled by Microsoft. Dylan is still an Apple research
project. None of them are truly suited to the Web environment. Java is as
revolutionary as the Web itself.&quot; Tying Netscape to Java assures the
company a central role in a coming efflorescence of the Web more significant
in its implications than even the current manifestation. In the process,
it will invert the entire world of software in a way that may permanently
displace Microsoft from the center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Behind this development is not some 24-year-old geek from a supercomputer
center, but the industry's most venerable leader after Bill Gates, not only
Microsoft's most persistent critic and nemesis, but also its most eminent
defeated rival: Bill Joy of Sun. In engineering Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
streamlining the communications functions and putting it all on the Net,
Andreessen was following in the codesteps of Joy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy was not only a founder of Sun Microsystems, he was also the primary
champion of the Berkeley brand of Unix--BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
Unix--that he husbanded as a student at the university. BSD Unix was not
only Sun's essential software technology, but also the reference code for
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the basic protocol
stack of the Arpanet in its evolution toward the current Internet). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By upgrading the TCP/IP protocol to run on an ethernet rather than on only
50-kilobit-per-second Arpanet lines and then giving away the Code, Bill
Joy made the Internet possible. When Sun declared in 1988 that the network
is the computer, the network it had in mind was run by Bill Joy's Network
File System (NFS), and it incorporated TCP/IP. Says Eric Schmidt--Bill Joy's
Berkeley colleague, now chief technical officer at Sun and leading prophet
of the coming software inversion--&quot;Sun was selling the Internet before
the Internet was there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, because Sun computers running BSD Unix were the most robust vessels
for TCP/IP, the lion's share of all host computers on the Web are still
Sun's, and Sun is experiencing an unexpected surge of earnings in the wake
of the Web. Now the computer world is wielding Marc Andreessen's browser
to rush toward the Net, wrenching the sphere from its moorings in Redmond,
and allowing it to oscillate toward a new center in Silicon Valley. Even
Bill Gates, the last holdout against Joy's network standard, is now bundling
TCP/IP with Windows 95. Joy must feel that the industry is coming home at
last. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Gates ignited the person computer market by writing Basic for the
PC, Joy is launching a new era on the Net by supplying a suitable software
language, Java. Joy foreshadowed Java at the 1990 PC Forum conference when
he said, &quot;Large programs are embarrassing because they have a fixed
set of ideas and so much code that it's very difficult to change them. And
they all tend to reflect existing metaphors, not the new metaphors. Everybody's
using C++. That's a 'crufty' language. It's very hard to understand. &quot;I'm
starting a small group to try to do something small--Sun Aspen Smallworks.
I believe it's possible to do small systems of a few hundred thousand lines
of code that live in this world of persistent distributed objects with open
protocols [and] make an incredible difference--much more than an extra 100,000
lines on a 10-million-line system. So I'm looking for a few great hackers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The one he found was redoubtable Sun engineer James Gosling. Called by John
Doerr of Kleiner Perkins &quot;perhaps the world's greatest living programmer,&quot;
Gosling is a bearded man with shaggy blondish hair. He displays a subtly
wounded look that is possibly the effect of a career that, to that point,
had consisted mostly of brilliant failures. But, like Joy, Gosling was eager
to do something small to bring Sun into the world of consumer electronics
where a large program used no more than a few thousand lines. In 1992, the
company spun out a subsidiary named FirstPerson Inc. to pursue this market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to conceive a way to take news, images, animations and other
real-time functions in cell sites and base stations and download them to
handheld devices such as digital cellular phones. But with the Newton fiasco,
personal digital assistants began to fall from favor and Sun and the rest
of the lemmings decided to pursue the suddenly seductive siren of interactive
TV. Again, they would use the Java (at the time called &quot;Oak&quot;)
programming language, this time running not on cellular phones, but in set-top
boxes. Here, too, the programs would have to be elegant and compact to use
the sparse memories affordable for a consumer appliance. However, Like Jim
Clark--and everyone else--Sun would soon discover that interactivity merely
offers cosmetics for the corpse of a dying television industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At this point, the project was in turmoil and former Apple designer Wayne
Rosing, its first manager, was on his way out. In May of last year, Sun
technical chief Eric Schmidt entered the breach, collapsed the set-top project
into a joint venture with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had bought
RCA, and summoned Joy from Aspen. Joy returned and spent the entire summer
last year in Palo Alto working with Schmidt and Gosling to figure out a
strategy for Java. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the characteristics
of a language suitable for PDAs not only gratified Joy's Laws of software,
but also fit almost perfectly the needs of the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like many technology projects that seem to spring full-blown from the brow
of a genius, Java is in fact the fruit of a near-lifelong quest. Gosling's
career began at age 14 in Calgary when, during a high school tour, he memorized
the code to the locks on the doors of the computer center at the University
of Calgary. He then regularly admitted himself to read computer texts and
use DEC PDP-8s. He became so proficient that he was hired a year later by
Digital Equipment to write machine code to be used for analyses of data
on the aurora borealis from Isis satellites. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on to Carnegie Mellon University to study under the eminent Robert
Sproull and Raj Reddy, he wrote a text editor called EMACS, a Pascal compiler
and a thesis entailing the creation of a program to do drawings of levers
and strings in visual, interactive models. After graduation in 1981, he
joined an IBM lab in Pittsburgh, where he developed the Andrew Windows system.
The first major program that could control a window on a computer remotely
across a network, it never found a home. But it launched Gosling on a 15-year
struggle with the challenge of how to send programs across a network that
could be executed on other computers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling had a breakthrough in 1983 at a Sun Microsystems conference at the
Red Lion in San Jose. There, Joy observed Gosling's Andrew Windows system
dramatically outperforming a workstation running Sun View, and began a concerted
effort to recruit him. Soon after, Gosling came to Sun to develop a remote
windows system called NeWS (Networked Extensible Windows System). Initially
received with great critical acclaim in the industry, it was eventually
blocked by the X-Windows consortium despite performing far more efficiently
over a network. Long a student of object-oriented programming beginning
with the Simula language, Gosling followed his NeWS project with a compound
doc<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ument architecture, joining text and images. It, too, garnered much praise
and paltry use. Then came Sun's ill-fated pursuit of consumer electronic
products. Gosling set out to develop appropriate programs in C++. But it
soon became clear to him that this language failed on nearly all the crucial
criteria. In particular it was neither reliable nor secure, which, funnily
enough, turned out to be two sides of the same coin. &quot;The gun you shoot
the burglar with can also shoot you in the foot.&quot; That was C++. It
had pointer code that allowed rogue programs to invade and corrupt a target
operating system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Gosling began revising C++ code into something that has been termed &quot;C++
minus minus.&quot; Returning to the inspiration of Andrew and NeWS, he adapted
the language to enable real-time operations across a network. In order to
run a variety of different programs on a variety of linked devices, from
set-top boxes to palmtop remotes, he made it inherently platform-neutral
and nomadic. It would have to be a language at home on a network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The project ended with Java, an efficient programming language that is safe,
simple, reliable and real-time, yet familiar to anyone who has used C or
C++. Designed for PDAs on infrared networks, it turned out to be perfectly
adapted for the Internet. Many of Java's virtues are made possible by the
fact that it is interpreted rather than compiled--that means that it is
translated line by line in real time in the user's computer rather than
converted to machine language in batch mode by the software vendor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most languages are written in two stages. The first is source code, couched
at a level of abstraction that rarely reveals its purposes or algorithmic
procedures. Normally, source code is proprietary and not revealed to the
user. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second stage is compilation. The compiler translates the abstractions
of the source code into &quot;binaries&quot;--the machine language of a
particular computer, locked into the set of instructions that its central
processing unit can perform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java, by contrast, is compiled not to an instruction set peculiar to a particular
microprocessor but to a virtual machine or generic computer. Putting the
language into an intermediate binary form allows creation of programs that
are not locked into any particular hardware platform, but that can still
be adapted to run fast. The intermediate code is translated line by line
by a software program called an interpreter located in the target computer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java's interpreters take up a parsimonious 45 kilobytes of memory. Sun already
has Java interpreters in the works for Microsoft Windows 95, the Mac, Windows
MT and several flavors of Unix. Netscape will include the appropriate interpreter
in future versions of the Netscape browser. This means that any program
written in Java will be portable to any common computer platform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, this portability does not seem remarkable. All programs
written in C, C++ or other compiled languages can be ported to any target
platform simply by running the source code through the appropriate compiler,
just as Mosaic was compiled for various platforms at the NCSA. The difference
is that Java can be &quot;compiled&quot; line by line in real time. That
is, it is interpreted in byte-level code in the client machine. This makes
all the difference. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It means that programs no longer have to reside in the machine where they
are used, or be written for that machine in order to be executed by it.
Potentially, a Java program can reside anywhere on the entire Internet and
be executed by any computer attached to the Internet. The little interpreters--sure
to become cheap and ubiquitous as they are distributed by Netscape and by
other suppliers of browsers--make Java programs &quot;dynamically portable&quot;
in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamically portable programs are suitable for a nomadic existence on the
Net, rather than a mere settled life on the desktop. Java thus emancipates
software from computer architecture. It offers a software paradigm radically
different from the Microsoft model, which is based not only on static compilation,
but on often-concealed, proprietary source code. <BR>

Suddenly, the entire world of new software is potentially available to every
computer owner. Rather than being restricted to the set of programs you
own, you can use any program on the Net, just as now you can tap any information
on the Net. You not only have data at your fingertips, you have programs
at your fingertips. This means &quot;executable content,&quot; as Joy describes
it and as John Gage demonstrated in his speech at the West St. Francis Hotel
this June. Whether a film, a graph, an animation, a real-time bit stream
on the Nasdaq ticker or the Reuters wire, a virtual reality visualization,
or a game, it can be downloaded to your machine with its program in tow.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Owning the operating system and associated tool libraries becomes irrelevant
to selling applications. Owning the application or channel becomes irrelevant
to selling the content. To the extent that Java or a similar language prevails,
software becomes truly open for the first time. The Microsoft desktop becomes
a commodity; the Intel microprocessor becomes peripheral--the key &quot;microprocessor&quot;
is the software code in the Java interpreter. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Interpreted or not, however, nomadic programs will not be permitted to range
the Net unless they are also secure programs. By several judicious alterations
of C++ procedures, Gosling made Java above all a secure language. Many viruses
depend on taking an integer in the program and using it to &quot;point&quot;
to a low address in the memory where operating code resides. Java removes
this pointer conversion function. In addition, incorporated into the Java
interpreter is a code verifier. As soon as an application shows up in a
machine, the interpreter does an instant virus scan. Finally, when Java
binary arrives at a machine, it will bear an RSA data signature that verifies
the source of the code and guarantees that it has not been altered or corrupted.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These security provisions make Java programs the first certifiable citizens
of the Net. As Java interpreters become ubiquitous, any application program
that is anchored on a particular platform and desktop will eventually become
a cripple, like a pro athlete who fears to fly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The computer hollows out, and you no longer are concerned with its idiosyncrasies,
its operating system, its instruction set, even its resident applications.
Instead, you can focus on content--on the world rather than on the desktop
architecture. If you want to run a helicopter model on your screen, you
don't have to worry about whether you have AutoCAD on your hard drive. You
can run a video of the helicopter without owning the right decoder, whether
Indeo (Intel's standard) or MPEG-4 (designed for portable appliances) or
dynamic JPEG. The helicopter flies over the Net with its own executable
code. The network is no longer a threatening place. If you want to use a
program from Finland, you don't have to worry that it will introduce a malignant
virus to your machine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your computer will never be the same. No longer will the features of the
desktop decide the features of the machine. No longer will the size of your
hard drive or the database in your LAN server determine the reach of your
information processing. No longer will the programs in your machine determine
the functions you can perform. The network is the computer. The computer
becomes a peripheral to the Internet and the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the release of Java and a demonstration Web browser called HotJava,
written in the language on the Sun home page, Gosling has experienced the
kind of sudden Internet celebrity undergone by Andreessen and Bina. Unlike
Andreessen, he seems somewhat baffled by it all. But in the long run, his
contribution may be greater. Browsers and servers may come and go, but successful
new languages are extremely rare. Java, or something like it, is the key
to a truly interactive Internet and a fully hollowed-out computer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Bill Joy made a presentation to the Sun board, outlining an upgrade
path for the future of the language. Joy is resolved that Java will not
go the way of Andrew and NeWS. Like Jim Clark, he has even turned to the
troubled supercomputer arena to find a treasure trove of new hackers. Sun
hired some 20 new programmers from the recently defunct but boldly pioneering
Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research. Presumably, they can learn
to think small. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling shakes his head at all the uproar. He now finds himself falling
thousands of messages behind in his e-mail. Linked to the Net by a mere
T1 line, even Sun's Java server broke down under the overload. But Gosling
himself seems to be holding up better. His speaking schedule has multiplied
to a rate of three talks a week. Scores of people tell him they are using
the language as a replacement for C, for IR (information resource) tools
and for other general-purpose applications. Giant Japanese companies such
as Sony and Sega besiege him. Finally, late in June, even Berners-Lee gave
Java his imprimature as &quot;one of the most exciting things happening
on the Web right now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A movie buff, Gosling sees Java, Netscape and similar programs changing
the image of the cypersphere from an alien and menacing dystopia, as depicted
famously in Blade Runner, into a realm resembling Star Trek, where computers
are trusted tools. Perhaps this transformation will favor the emergence
of the amiable and gregarious young Marc Andreessen as the paladin of cyberspace,
replacing the fiercely brilliant but widely feared Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Andreessen admits, a more likely outcome is a massive move by Microsoft
onto the Net where the two will enter battle with scores of contenders.
This month, Microsoft announced an array of Internet services, under the
rubric Blackbird, with many interesting features. But it works only with
Microsoft Network Services, which will not become truly widespread for another
year. Beginning with virtually no market share and a year or so behind,
Gates will become an under dog at last. Perhaps even the Justice Department
will notice. In the age of the hollowed-out computer, the king of the desktop
rules an emigrating empire. <BR>

<P>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska wants to know: With deregulation of telecommunications,
who will bring connections to Unalakleet, to Aleknagik and to Sleetmute?
Who will bring 500 channels up the Yukon with the salmon to the people in
Beaver? What will happen to the Yupik, the Inupiat and the Inuit? Will we
leave them stranded in the snow while the world zooms off to new riches
on an information superhighway?<BR>
<BR>
A senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Stevens is a key figure in the telecom deregulation debate on Capitol Hill.
As he contemplates the issues of restructuring communications law, he has
reason to be suspicious of the grand claims of an information age. He knows
that universal service--the magic of available dial tone in your own home--has
hardly reached rural Alaska at all. As George Calhoun points out in his
sort invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881 and now extended to some
95% of American households) are simply not feasible, either technically
or economically, in many remote regions.<BR>
<BR>
In Beaver, for example, there is one telephone in a hut linked to a nine-foot
satellite dish. Permafrost and cold economic reality make it impossible
to extend dial tone to the several hundred households of this town, even
though its average household income, mostly from salmon fishing, is some
$120,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ted Stevens is right to be concerned. Portentiously sharing his concern
are other powerful Republicans from rural states, including Larry Pressler
of South Dakota, the chairman of the subcommittee. Extended now from phone
service to broadband digital superhighways, their concerns could pose a
deadly obstacle to true deregulation of communications and thus to continued
American leadership in these central technologies of the age. At stake is
some $2 trillion of potential value to the U.S. economy (see Forbes ASAP,
April 10). The problems of universal service in Alaska disguise the more
profound paradox of telephone service in most of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the universality of telephones is crucial to their usefulness;
yet universal service using current technology is totally uneconomical and
impractical. Snow and ice are the least of it. The basic problem is the
architecture of the system, with a separate pair of lines, on average two
miles long, devoted exclusively to each user. It simply does not pay to
lay, entrench, string, protect, test and maintain miles of copper wire pairs,
each dedicated to one household that uses them on average some 15 or 20
minutes a day.<BR>
<BR>
Connections in cities are one thing. Urban access systems comprise a bramble
of millions of wire loops, each linking a home or business telephone to
a nearby central office switch. Under a half mile in length, these lines
still represent some 80% of the cost of the system. But because the lines
are short and often bundled together, city telephony benefits from economies
of scale and convenience. In rural areas, however, the copper lines cost
between 10 and 30 times as much per customer as they do in cities.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Calhoun reports that in general, phone companies cannot supply
ISDN (integrated services digital network) and other digital services over
twisted-pair wire more than 18,000 feet (some 3.5 miles) from the central
office. Perhaps a third of all the nation's phones are more than 3.5 miles
from a central office.<BR>
<BR>
What saves us is socialism. Closing the huge differential between the costs
of serving rural and urban customers is a Byzantine web of cross-subsidies,
whereby inner-city and business callers in urban areas subsidize the worthy
citizens of Kirby, Vt.; Vail, Colo.; Mendocino, Calif.; Round Rock, Texas,
and Tyringham, Mass., among other bucolic locales, to the tune of billions
of dollars. Overall, subsidies from business and urban customers to rural
and other expensive residential users total some $20 billion a year. In
case the cross-subsidies do not suffice to guarantee universality, Congress
has established a $700 million &quot;Universal Service Fund.&quot; For all
that, some 5% of homes still lack telephone service (compared with 2% unreached
by TV, which faces no universal service requirement).<BR>
<BR>
Lending huge physical authority to this Sisyphean socialist scheme are some
65,049,600 tons of copper wire rooted deep in the rights of way, depreciation
schedules, balance sheets, mental processes and corporate cultures of the
regional Bell operating companies and other so-called local-exchange carriers.
The minimum replacement cost of these lines deployed over the last 50 years
or more--and still being installed through the mid-1990s at a rate of at
least five million lines a year--is some $300 billion. By comparison, Calhoun
estimates, the telcos could replace every telephone switch for one-tenth
that amount while radically upgrading the system.<BR>
<BR>
In this cage of twisted copper wires writhe not only the executives of the
telephone companies, but also the addled armies of telecommunications regulators,
from the Federal Communications Commission and other Washington bodies to
50 state public utilities commissions and the towering hives of lawyers
in the communications bar. The coils of copper also subtly penetrate the
thought processes of MIT Media Lab gurus, libertarian lobbyists from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and myriad political analysts who see this
massive metal millstone as a fell weapon of monopoly power. The copper colossus
even intimidates scores of staunch Republicans who have arrived in Washington
determined to extirpate every government excess, but who bow before the
totem of universal service in their districts.<BR>
<BR>
Like any socialist system, the copper colossus will die hard. But die it
must.<BR>
<BR>
Some 20 years ago, AT&amp;T's long-distance lines comprised a similarly
imperious cage of copper wires, installed over the previous 50 years and
similarly impossible for rivals to duplicate. Then too, analysts termed
telephony a natural monopoly because the system could handle additional
calls for essentially zero incremental cost and because network externalities
ensured that the larger the number of customers, the more valuable the system.
These assumptions had led to government endorsement of the Bell monopoly
as a common carrier committed to universal service.<BR>
<BR>
Regulators, politicians and litigators always imagine that they can control
the future of telecom, awarding monopoly privileges in exchange for various
high-minded goals, such as universal or enriched services. But their actual
role, as Peter Huber and his associates show in their new text, Federal
Broadband Law, is mostly to promote monopoly at the expense of such values
as universality, which ultimately depend not on law but on innovation. As
a form of tax, regulations reduce the supply of the taxed output. It is
technological and entrepreneurial progress, impelled by low tax rates and
deregulation, that brings once- rare products into the reach of the poor,
always the world's largest untapped market.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, the decline and fall of the long-distance monopoly was not
chiefly an effect of politics or litigation but of technology. Effectively
dissolving the copper cage of long distance were the millimeter waves of
microwave radio. Over the years, it turned out you could set up microwave
towers anywhere and duplicate long-distance services at radically lower
cost without installing any new wires at all. But this realization came
woefully slowly to the regulators.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;above-890-megahertz&quot; decision of 1959, made possible by
new Klystron tubes and other devices that opened up higher frequencies to
communications, the FCC permitted creation of private microwave networks.
On the surface, it was a narrow decision affecting a few large corporations.
But as AT&T planners noted at the time, it represented a clear break from
the previous principles of common carriage, cross-subsidy and nationwide
price averaging in the telephone network.<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, over the next two decades a cascade of further decisions climaxed
with the authorization of MCI to emerge as a direct competitor to AT&amp;T.
Within less than a decade, MCI added to its panoply of aerial microwaves
the yet more advanced technology of single-mode glass fibers. Issuing some
$3 billion of junk bonds over a four-year period, MCI built the first nationwide
network of advanced fiber optics. GTE made comparable investments in Sprint,
and AT&T rushed to excel its new rivals. Combining microwave with fiber,
long-distance telephony became a technologically aggressive and openly competitive
arena; AT&amp;T's monopoly was a thing of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the remaining monopolies in local phone service face a threat from
radio technology still more devastating than the microwave threat to AT&T in
long distance. As with microwaves, the government--in the name of preventing
monopoly--dallied for decades before acting to allow elimination of the
monopolies it had earlier established. After the invention of cellular at
Bell Labs in 1947, some 34 years passed before the FCC finally began granting
licenses for cellular telephony. By the 1980s, the FCC and Judge Harold
Greene, managing the Modified Final Judgment breaking up AT&amp;T, permitted
limited competition in wireless telephony. However, the FCC allocated half
the metropolitan licenses to existing RBOCs, which had no interest in using
wireless to attack the local loop monopoly. The other licenses it assigned
by lottery to gamblers and financiers with no ability to create an alternative
local loop. The process of buying out the spectrum speculators required
leading wireless carriers to hobble themselves with huge amounts of junk-bond
debt. Although McCaw Cellular Communications created a robust national system,
its financial structure prevented aggressive price competition with wireline
service.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the idea persists that wireless telephony is an expensive supplement
to the existing copper colossus rather than a deadly rival of it. The installed
base of twisted-pair wire still appears to many to be a barrier to entry
for new competitors in the local loop, rather than a barrier to RBOC entry
into modern communications markets. The conventional wisdom sees the electromagnetic
spectrum as a scarce resource. Few believe that it will soon emerge as a
cheaper and better alternative to the local loop, in the same way that microwave
emerged as a cheaper and better substitute for copper long-distance wires.

Making Waves</B></PRE>
At the foundation of the information economy, from computers to telephony,
is the microcosm of semiconductor electronics. It reaches out in a fractal
filigree of wires and switches that repeat their network patterns at every
level from the half-adder in a calculator chip or the SLIC in a telephone
handset to the coaxial trees and branches of a cable TV system or the mazes
of switched and routed lines in the global Internet. In computers, engineers
lay out the wires and switches across the tiny silicon substrates of microchips.
In telecommunications, engineers lay out the wires and switches across the
mostly silicon substrates of continents and seabeds. But it is essentially
the same technology, governed by quantum science and electrical circuit
theory.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor engineers may still spend more of their time with circuit
theory, contemplating the operations of resistors, inductors and capacitors
on currents and voltages in the device. But quantum theory is most fundamental,
because it allows humans for the first time to manipulate matter from the
inside--to control the conduction bands and energy-band gaps of the internal
atomic structure of silicon and other elements, and to make electrons, holes
and photons leap and lase at the behest of the designer. It is quantum theory
that allows chip engineers to control with exquisite precision, gauged in
tenths of microns and trillionths of seconds, the movements of electrons
at the heart of electronics.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of quantum theory, however, is a perplexing duality. Most of
contemporary physics seems to deal with particles--electrons, quarks, leptons,
neutrons, protons. In 1994, for example, scientists at Fermilabs in Chicago
announced &quot;discovery&quot; of the &quot;top quark,&quot; which they
described as the &quot;last building block of matter.&quot; Yet these entities
manifest themselves only in the midst of explosions in which their wave
signatures can be identified. So-called quantum particle theory is unintelligible
without quantum wave theory.<BR>
<BR>
The elements of quantum physics intrinsically combine the characteristics
of particles--definite specks of mass--with the characteristics of waves--
an infinite radiance of fields and forces. Entirely unlike particles, waves
merge, mingle and mesh in vectors and tensors propagating boundlessly through
space.<BR>
<BR>
It is this paradoxical combination of the definite with the infinite that
gives the microcosm its promise as a medium, not only for computation in
one place, but for communications everywhere. Spectrum unfolds in a global
ethersphere of interpenetrating waves that reach in a self- similar fractal
pattern from the plasmas of semi-conductor lasers through the ethers of
the planet.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the telecosm of modern communications brings decisively to the fore
the wave side of the quantum duality. Wires may seem more solid and reliable
than air. But the distinction is largely spurious. In proportion to the
size of its nucleus, an atom in a copper wire is as empty as the solar system
is in proportion to the size of the sun. The atmosphere and wires are alternative
media, and to the electron or photon are only arbitrarily distinguishable.
Whether insulated by air or by plastic, both offer resistance, capacitance,
inductance, noise and interference. In thinking about communications, the
concept of solidity is mostly a distraction. The essence of new devices
emerges more and more as manifestations of waves.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in the air or in a wire, the electrons or photons do not travel;
they wiggle their charges, causing oscillations that pass through the medium
at close to the speed of light. As in waves of water, the wave moves, but
the molecules of water stay in the same place. Thus belied is the analogy
of particles or even bullets favored by physics teachers who give primacy
to the mass rather than to the wave. Since the age of carrier pigeons and
catapults, communications systems have transmitted masses only in the postal
services.<BR>
<BR>
Today, even in entirely stationary electronic systems, the wave action is
increasingly dominant. The microchip itself--a Pentium processor, say--now
runs at 120 megahertz, a rate in cycles per second that puts it in the middle
of the FM radio band. New computers must pass the FCC requirements for radio
emissions. Texas Instruments now advertises its 486 SXL-66 microprocessors
as selling for under 50 cents per megahertz. Increasingly in the world of
computers, people speak of bandwidth and cycles, reserving the discussion
of mass chiefly for the batteries. The world of the telecosm is subtly shifting
from electronics, with its implicit primacy of electrons, to what might
be termed spectronics, seeing the particle as an expression of the wave
rather than the other way around--moving from Bohr's atom and Heisenberg's
electronic uncertainty to Maxwell's rainbow and Schrodinger's wave equation.<BR>
<BR>
In a global marketplace increasingly unified by telecommunications at the
speed of light, the vision of waves as fundamental affords not only a better
image of physics, but also a better purchase on economic reality than a
spurious search for solid states, physical resources, national economies
and commodity products.<BR>
<BR>
Conceived as some irreducible essence, the particle of mass, whether in
the form of a top quark or Higgs boson, wire conduit or central switch,
pushes our thinking about the world toward a vision of ultimately discrete
and confinable entities, with electrons moving through the p-n junctions
of microchips like so many steel ingots crossing a national border. Conceived,
by contrast, as a continuous span of waves and frequencies, tossing and
cresting, reflecting, diffusing, superposing and interfering, the telecosmic
vision accords with the ever-rising global commerce in information services--ubiquitous,
simultaneous, convergent, emergent.<BR>
<BR>
To grasp the next phases of the information economy, one begins not with
the atom or any other discrete entity, but with the wave. In 1865, in a
visionary coup that the late Richard Feynman said would leave the American
Civil War of the same decade as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by
comparison, Scotch physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic
spectrum. This spread of frequencies usable for communications is both the
practical resource and the most profound metaphor for the global information
economy.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a domain of limits, to be husbanded by governments and appropriately
allocated by auctions at a price of billions of dollars for a tiny span
of wiggle rates? Is it beachfront property to be coveted as a finite and
unrenewable resource? Is it a constricted domain to be exploited under the
iron laws of diminishing returns? Is it a zero-sum game to erupt in Star
Wars and street fights as satellite magnates and personal communications
entrepreneurs crowd into a feudal fray of frequencies? At the heart of the
gathering abundance of the information economy, would it sustain a new economics
of scarcity?<BR>
<BR>
So one might imagine from today's conventional wisdom. Contemplating these
limits, diminishing returns and zero-sum economics at Richard Shaffer's
Mobile Forum in March was industry guru Carl Robert Aron. He sees the world
of wireless entering a &quot;new ice age,&quot; like the recent ordeal of
the tire industry in the face of radials. He predicts that customers, capital
and revenues will become increasingly scarce and many species of company
will become extinct. Offering a similarly grim vision, BellSouth Vice President
of Corporate Development Mark Feidler declares that the price elasticity
of demand for telephony is negative--you lower the price and revenues will
sink. On the same panel, AT&amp;T-McCaw executive Rod Nelson asserted that
he could see no threat from personal communications services, because McCaw
was already offering &quot;a low-priced, high-quality service.&quot; Even
Martin Cooper of ArrayComm saw spectrum as a limited resource sure to grow
more valuable over time.<BR>
<BR>
What would Maxwell say? As he discovered it, the spectrum is infinite, ubiquitous,
instantaneous and cornucopian. Infinite wave action, not the movement of
masses, is the foundation of all physics. It ushers in an age of boundless
bandwidth beyond the dreams of most communications prophets. As industry
guru Ira Brodsky concludes in his authoritative new book, Wireless: The
Revolution in Personal Communications, &quot;We are quickly moving from
the era of spectrum shortage to the age of spectrum glut.&quot; This expanding
wavescape is the most fertile frontier of the information economy. In its
actions are the essential character of the coming economics of abundance
and increasing returns.<BR>
<BR>
In contemporary networks, as Nicholas Negroponte stresses in his best-selling
book, Being Digital, all bits are fungible. In spectronics, all spectrum
is fungible. In particular, the distinction between wireline and wireless
service dissolves. A wire is just a means of spectrum reuse. Down adjacent
wires, appropriately twisted or insulated, you can transmit the same frequencies
without fear of interference or noise.<BR>
<BR>
Using new digital radio technologies, such as code division multiple access
or smart and directional antenna systems, you can similarly beam the same
frequencies through the atmosphere, insulated by air. The chief difference
is that the wire system costs far more to install and inhibits mobility.<BR>
<BR>
The only wire technology commanding a decisive edge over wireless for critical
applications is fiber optics. The intrinsic bandwidth of a fiber thread
is nearly 1,000 times larger than the bandwidth of all the &quot;air&quot;
currently used for terrestrial radio communications. In both media, capacity
is largely governed by the need to avoid the water molecules that absorb
many frequencies of electromagnetic <BR>
waves--in air, from humidity or precipitation; in fiber, from the unremovable
residue of water in the structure of the glass.<BR>
<BR>
Compared with perhaps 30 gigahertz of currently accessible frequencies in
the air, every fiber thread can potentially bear 25,000 gigahertz. This
huge bandwidth derives from the possibility of using infrared light frequencies
for long-distance communications rather than radio or microwave frequencies.
When you are dealing in terahertz (infrared light encompasses some 50 trillion
hertz worth of frequencies between 7.5 X 10[11] and 3.5 X 10[14]), there
is a lot of room for sending messages.<BR>
<BR>
One fiber thread the width of a human hair can potentially use about 25
trillion of those hertz for communications (the rest tend to be fraught
with moisture). This span is enough to carry all the phone calls in America
on the peak moment of Mother's Day, or to bear three million six-megahertz
high-definition television channels--all down one fiber thread the width
of a human hair. As Paul Green sums it up, fiber commands 10 orders of magnitude
greater bandwidth than copper telephone lines and 10 orders of magnitude
lower bit-error rates. Optical engineers have packed as many as a million
such threads in one bundle with a cross-section a centimeter square. Such
feats plausibly support the assertion that, as a practical matter, spectrum
is infinite.<BR>
<BR>
The capacity of fiber is so large that the best way to think of it is as
a radio system in glass--a fibersphere that can potentially accommodate
as many as 10,000 separate wavelength bitstreams. Under a system called
wavelength division multiplexing, users will tune in to a chosen frequency
band in the same way they currently time in to a chosen radio or television
channel, whether in the air or in a coaxial cable. Indeed, engineers can
take the same infrared frequencies used in fiber and move them to the air
for shorter distance applications such as local-area networks, point-to-point
connections between buildings, links between handheld computers and desktop
hosts, and even television remote controls. As tunable laser transmitters
and photodiodes, along with other optoelectronic gear, become more sensitive
and efficient, airborne infrared will become more robust and useful. Experiments
by the Israelis with ultraviolet frequencies suggest that even these superhigh
frequencies above visible light might someday be used for communications
through the atmosphere (offering tens of thousands of TV channels, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Now the FCC has auctioned off 120 megahertz of frequencies for personal
communications services. The most prominent winning bidders were consortia
led by Sprint, TCI, Comcast and Cox (a long-distance carrier and three cable
companies going under the name Wireless Co.); by AT&T; and by AirTouch,
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S West as PCS PrimeCo. Most analysis has focused
on what is called the wireless market and has assumed the major competitor
to PCS to be the current cellular companies. Aron's ice-age ruminations
stemmed from contemplation of this radical increase in competition for a
limited number of cellular customers who currently cost some $540 each to
sign up (counting handset subsidies) and whose per-capita revenues are declining
at a pace of some 8% per year. Remember BellSouth's Feidler's vision of
a negative elasticity of phone markets, meaning that lower prices bring
lower revenues?<BR>
<BR>
From a spectronic perspective, all this analysis is deeply misleading. Whether
channeled down wires or through the air, spectrum is spectrum. Digital wireless
is a cheaper and better way of delivering service. The market for PCS is
not the cellular customer, but the one billion wireline customers in rich
countries and the several billions of potential phone and teleputer customers
around the globe. In pursuing these customers, the price elasticities will
be dramatically positive, with various price points reachable with new wireless
technologies releasing torrents of new demand and new revenues. What Aron
calls an ice age will in fact prove to be a gigantic global warming, unleashing
huge new growth in telephony, using spectrum in all its various forms (except
perhaps the twisted-pair copper wires that currently dominate the installed
base of the industry).<BR>
<BR>
The winning bidders from AT&T and Sprint did not put up their $3.7 billion
in order to join a zero-sum straggle for new cellular customers. These bidders
are dominated by long- distance businesses that can use PCS to reduce their
some $30 billion in access charges to the local exchange carriers by creating
an alternative local loop. Similarly, MCI, though avoiding the auction,
created a subsidiary called MCI Metro that may seek to manage service for
spectrum winners in 17 cities, again harvesting the benefits of obviated
access charges. Then all these companies can use their PCS technologies
to pursue customers around the world without any thought of wire.<BR>
<BR>
A chart created by industry analyst Herschel Shosteck illustrates the opportunity.
The Shosteck chart is a bell curve relating the incomes of the world's households
to telephone penetration rates. He shows that telephony has so far penetrated
only to countries representing the top tail of the curve, where national
wealth suffices to reduce the cost of telephony to a threshold of between
4% and 5% of incomes. As incomes rise around the globe, more and more people
cross the telecom threshold. A chart of GDP in real dollars per capita versus
telephone penetration shows that a 40% rise in incomes could bring a 1,600%
increase in potential customers.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the surge in incomes, however, will be the plummeting cost of
wireless telephony. Shosteck estimates that between 1985 and 1994 the price
per customer dropped 80%, from $5,000 to $1,000. Combining these two trends,
he calculates that there will be between 400 million and 800 million new
wireless subscribers by the end of the year 2000. These numbers represent
an awesome upsurge from the world's current level of some 60 million cellular
customers. Any further acceleration in income growth or decline in telephone
prices will increase these numbers. A 50% further drop in telephone prices
combined with a 50% rise in incomes would quickly thrust the vast bulk of
the world's population above the Shosteck threshold. Far from the negative
elasticities that U.S. phone executives see in their saturated wireline
voice business, the world-wide communications market will be a financial
trampoline.

In an ordinary industry, a 50% drop in price seems a major obstacle. But
telephony is becoming a branch of the computer industry, which doubles its
cost effectiveness every 18 months. The wireless convergence of digital
electronics and spectronics will allow the industry to escape its copper
cage and achieve at least a tenfold drop in the real price of telephony
in the next seven years.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Stevens should meet Martin Cooper, a former research chief at Motorola
and now CEO of ArrayComm. Located in San Jose, ArrayComm is devoted to drastically
reducing the cost of telephone access over the next two years while entirely
obviating the problems of twisted-pair wiring that afflict Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
The current pitch of ice-age cellular providers is &quot;pay more and get
less. . .and don't even think about universal service.&quot; Although they
claim penetration rates in industrial countries of nearly 10%, most cellular
users make most of their calls on wireline systems. The real market share
of cellular is in fact under 1% in the industrial world. The cellular companies'
formula for success is to exploit the public hunger for mobility by charging
more money for worse service--extracting premium prices for calls with acoustics
and reliability far inferior to wireline telephony. Followed by both sides
of the cellular duopoly--by Bells, McCaws and other suppliers--this pay-more-
for-less-and-worse formula has concealed from much of the industry the basic
technological fact that wireless will soon be acoustically better than wireline
and drastically cheaper as well. As the CD example shows, after all, digital
sound systems are superior to analog. And without wires, phones finesse
the largest capital and labor costs of conventional telephony.<BR>
<BR>
In economic terms, the intrinsic cost advantage of wireless is concealed
by the colossal installed base of copper. Already mostly paid for and largely
written off, the 154 million twisted-pair access lines will allow the Bells
to compete in price for some time with wireless rivals that have lower real
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, technical reality will prevail in the end. Spectronics offers
technologies in four dimensions for dividing and conquering spectrum: Frequency
division, time division, code division and space division. All address in
various ways the issue of frequency rouse--how many times in a system particular
frequencies can be roused without causing interference in other calls using
the same frequencies. Of the four techniques, so far only frequency division
has been widely exploited. As these other methods come on line, the cost
of telephony will go over the same kind of digital cliff long familiar in
computers.<BR>
<BR>
Surveying all these proposed schemes and their promised upgrades (see sidebar
next page), it is safe to project between a 60% and 90% drop in the cost
of wireless telephony over the next five years, depending mostly on the
progress of CDMA. Qualcomm's CDMA could reduce costs tenfold, compared with
the threefold gains from current global services mobile (GSM) technology,
which contemplates an upgrade path chiefly through downgrading the voice
quality with a half-rate vocoder.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains in wireless efficiency from dividing by time, code or frequency
are compounded by dividing spectrum by space. Mathematically, every 50%
reduction in the cell radius yields a 400% increase in the number of customers
who can be served in a given area with a given technology. Huge theoretical
gains accrue from cell-splitting--reducing the physical extent of cells
and multiplying their numbery--converting current macrocells as large as
35 miles in diameter into microcells a mile or so in width, and into picocells
measured in hundreds of yards in buildings, shopping centers or congested
urban streets.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains, however, could be nullified by the expense and difficulty
of implanting base stations all over cities and neighborhoods. The key to
the gains of space division, therefore, is creation of base stations drastically
cheaper, smaller, more discreet and more functional than the current cell
sites, costing between $500,000 and $1 million, occupying 1,000 square feet
and containing between 55 and 416 radios, depending on the frequency reuse
factor. The most notable breakthrough in base stations is the Steinbrecher
MiniCell, to be demonstrated in July and launched at the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Putting a base station into a briefcase, Steinbrecher uses a single broadband
digital radio to perform the functions of between 55 and 416 analog transceivers.
The key breakthrough is a proprietary mixer that can flawlessly down-convert
all the waveforms in the entire cellular spectrum into a stream of baseband
digital bits without losing any information or introducing spurious signals.
Containing all the electromagnetic contents of the cell, this digital bitstream
is broken into channels by a 0.4- micron technology application-specific
integrated circuit and is interpreted by digital signal processors. Governed
by the learning curves of semiconductors, the MiniCell promises to reduce
the cost of a cell site by an initial factor of 10 and by an eventual factor
governed chiefly by the Moore's Law exponentials manifested in the PC industry.<BR>
<BR>
In an important article in the April issue of IEEE Personal Communications,
Donald Cox, former Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford, calculated
that such digital base station technologies soon could lower capital costs
per wireless customer to $14, compared with a current cellular cost of $5,555
(assuming, in both cases, 180 channels per unit).<BR>
<BR>
Using leading-edge silicon technology, the broadband digital radio can transform
the entire landscape of wireless. It takes the channeling, tuning, filtering,
modulation, demodulation, coding, decoding and other processing out of the
analog radio domain, where a different radio system is needed for each frequency
band or modulation scheme. Moved into a digital signal processor or ASIC,
these functions yield to the huge efficiencies of the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate in space division, for example, is devoting the entire available
spectrum to every caller. Using broadband digital radios fed by arrays of
smart antennas, Cooper's ArrayComm is approaching this ultimate. &quot;We
believe that over the next few years, everyone will be using broadband radios,&quot;
Cooper says, pointing to Watkins- Johnson and Airnet joining Steinbrecher
in this business (though with far narrower bandwidths).<BR>
<BR>
All base stations, one way or another, have to find all the callers in a
cell and link them to callers outside. Broadband digital radios move the
search function from an array of radios to a single computer. Cooper contrasts
the technology with radar. As he puts it, traditional radar systems use
active beams to scan a location and find a targeted object; ArrayComm uses
a passive array of antennas and a digital radio to provide a broadband snapshot
of a cell 20 times a second, and employs computers to locate the targeted
object, in this case a handset.<BR>
<BR>
Like the Craig McCaw-Bill Gates low-earth-orbit satellite scheme called
Teledesic, the ArrayComm IntelliCell originated with work done for the Strategic
Defense Initiative program. Inventor Richard Roy developed algorithms for
rapidly calculating the source and trajectory of missiles from their electromagnetic
emissions as detected by satellite antennas scanning the surface of the
earth. Now he is using similar algorithms to identify the position, direction,
distance and amplitude of electromagnetic emissions from handsets in a wireless
cell, as collected by arrays of smart antennas at a base station. Once the
information is digitized, Roy's algorithms can sort out all the calls by
their location in the cell, excavating signals otherwise buried in neighboring
noise or shrouded in cross- talk, and conducting several calls at once on
the same frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper gives the analogy of human hearing. &quot;You close your eyes and
I walk around talking, and you can point to me at any moment. Add another
voice and you can still listen to me, or shift to the other voice. You can
hear the voice you want to hear twice as loudly as the voice you want to
suppress. You null out the interference. This is not a physical process.
You don't move your ears. Your brain calculates and correlates the different
sounds or signals. That's what Dick Roy's algorithms do in our smart base
stations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Roy explains further: &quot;That works if you have a variety of frequencies.
Suppose, though, you were faced with a chores of monks all chanting in monotone
in the same frequencies. This is more like the cellular telephone or PCS
situation in the presence of interference or cross-talk. This is what prevents
frequency reuse in adjacent cells. Amid the drone of the monks, you could
not isolate the sound of one monk. What you need is more ears. Then you
could resolve the source of a particular sound by its location. That is
what we do with antenna arrays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adding a spatial dimension to the frequencies, time slots or codes tracked
by ordinary cell sites, an ArrayComm system can distinguish signals entirely
unintelligible to other systems. For example, an array with eight antennas
can effectively magnify the signal by a factor of eight. There is no theoretical
limit to the number of antennas, but as a practical matter, the size of
the array becomes a problem in urban cells. By moving up spectrum from 900
megahertz 15 centimeters to 1,800 megahertz, PCS reduces the size of the
antenna array from two meters across to one meter across (antenna size drops
in proportion to the decline in wavelength at higher frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the effective magnification of signals, an eight-antenna
array could double the range of a base station, quadruple the area covered,
reduce to one-third or one-fourth the number of cell sites, and raise frequency
reuse to 100%, without CDMA. Because CDMA doesn't define channels by frequency
at all, but by codes, its limit is the number of codes that can be differentiated
in the cell. Thus, Roy believes that among all the competing technologies,
CDMA can benefit most from using the spatial dimension. Spatial processing
can help differentiate the calls in a cell as the noise of call codes accumulates
toward the limit where further traffic is impossible. As Qualcomm leader
Andrew Viterbi declared in a paper released on Jan. 13: &quot;Spatial processing
remains as the most promising, if not the last frontier, in the evolution
of multiple access systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm is part of what Don Steinbrecher calls &quot;the transformation
of wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot; As a computer
business, wireless will share in the gains of Moore's Law. It will double
cost effectiveness every 18 months, rather than continuing on the stagnant
price curves of wireline telephony in its cage of copper, dominated by the
costs of rolling out trucks, digging trenches, laying wire and climbing
poles.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper predicts that over the next five years, the combination of broadband
digital radios, ArrayComm smart antennas and a stream of other advances
in wireless telephony will reduce the cost per minute of wireless phone
calls to a penny a minute, one-quarter the average wireline level and one-twelfth
the current cellular price. This price collapse will ignite huge positive
elasticities in demand, reaching for the first time billions of new customers
in India, China and Latin America who are now untouched by telephony.<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm's first customers are Alcatel in Europe, which is creating a system
for GSM, and DDI Tokyo Pocket Telephone. The fastest growing company on
the Tokyo stock exchange for the last five years, DDI is often termed the
MCI of Japan. Using transceiver chipsets from Cirrus Logic's PCSI subsidiary,
DDI is already the world leader in low-cost wireless telephony. The ArrayComm
technology should lower its costs to the point where these pocket telephones
can break through as a wireless local loop throughout the huge new markets
of Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the DDI technology, called Personal
Handy Phone, was combined with a Bellcore-Motorola proposal as a new low-end
wireless standard under the name Personal Access Communications Systems.<BR>
<BR>
By transforming the technical landscape of communications, spectronics are
also transforming the lawscape. Indeed, by entirely closing the gap between
the costs of serving rural and urban customers, digital wireless phones
will obliterate the need for cross-subsidies that underlie the entire regulatory
edifice. In the new world of bandwidth abundance, the only group that will
need cross- subsidies and emergency aid is the communications bar.<BR>
<BR>
As a guide to the era ahead, telephone executives, regulators and Washington
politicians should contemplate the computer industry. The market share of
centralized time- shared computer systems dropped from 100% in 1977 to less
than 1% in 1987. International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp.
lost nearly $100 billion in market cap in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Or, for a more recent example of the power of wireless technology in the
digital age, the telcos, regulators and politicians should consider the
video distribution industry, Last year, Washington was so obsessed with
the cable industry and its apparent monopoly power that Congress enacted
a reregulation bill that ultimately imposed 700 pages of new rules on the
distribution of video news and entertainment. Politicians and pundits let
forth a stream of lamentations about the future access of the poor and the
rural to the new services of digital television and proposed a series of
new requirements for universal service.<BR>
<BR>
A year later, however, the very survival of the cable industry as a distributor
of point-multipoint video is in doubt. Before Congress could enact broadband
universal service rules, Direct Broadcast Satellites were propagating 150
channels of digital video with supreme universality over the entire expanse
of the continental United States. Attaching 18-inch dishes to the tops of
their igloos, the Inuits might acquire television images of a variety and
resolution far excelling any offering of cable television in the midst of
the nation's capital. With a software upgrade to MPEG-2 video planned later
this year, the number of channels will rise to some 200.<BR>
<BR>
Privately dubbed &quot;deathstar&quot; by cable industry executives, digital
DBS became the fastest growing product in the history of consumer electronics.
Just seven months after its introduction, it had already surpassed the combined
first-year sales of VCRs, CD players and big-screen TVs.<BR>
<BR>
Today, in the name of deregulation, politicians are preparing to impose
a series of new competitive requirements upon the Bell operating companies,
on the assumption that they still wield monopoly power. Pundits still seem
to believe that the copper cage protects local telephone companies from
outside competition. But in fact, the cage incarcerates them in copper wires,
while the world prepares to pass them by.<BR>
<BR>
The digital future is not wired or wireless. It is spectronic and spectacular.
To participate in this explosive market, all telephone companies will have
to escape from their copper cages into the infinite reaches of the spectrum.<BR>

<PRE></PRE>
MICHAEL MILKEN IS BACK! Back, so the story goes, from the orgies of '80s
greed, back from the best-selling den of thieves, back from his preening
at the predators' ball, back from soft time at Pleasanton pen, back from
prostate cancer and plagues of litigation, back to tell his own book to
William Novak and to buy his redemption with the spoils of his crimes. Yes,
so they say, Milken is back, while thousands of plundered companies and
communities labor to regain their standard of living and jobs, long lost
in the shuffle of his dismal deals and loaded down with his &quot;high yields.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Milken is back. Back from the gutters of Ponzi finance, the rot of
junk and S&L sleaze, angling: to launder his weaseled wealth with educational
hype and charity hustles. Back, aiming now at history and posterity rather
than at new opportunity, but hitting it big instead with Michael Jackson,
Doonesbury laughs and Clifton compassion photo ops. Meanwhile, even the
ascendant Republicans in Washington try to steer clear of &quot;eighties
excesses&quot; of debt and deficits and supply-side economics.<BR>
<BR>
Or so it looks to media observers of the Milken saga. And yet slowly and
arduously, there is emerging from the carrels of the Harvard Business School
and other institutions a distinctly different tale.<BR>
<BR>
Under the leadership of Michael Jensen, a small group of Harvard Business
School scholars has been scrutinizing all the statistics of corporate behavior
during the 1980s. They have laboriously appraised the results of all the
leveraged buyouts, junk bond issues, venture capital, and other tools of
corporate making and remaking. They have arrived at unexpected conclusions
and have developed a new body of theory to explain them. From this perspective,
the events of the 1980s--and Milken's role--assume a wholly new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen puts the Milken episode in the context of another form of wretched
excess for which Milken was the remedy: namely, the excesses of corporate
waste and conglomeration by empire-building managers with scarcely any ownership
stake in their companies. Amid the sieges of deregulation and tax rate reduction,
amid the obvious tumult in the markets for oil, tires, tobacco, real estate,
gold and commodities, many industries needed profound restructuring. But
their entrenched managements were set to expand their domains through acquisition
and investment in new capacity. Meanwhile, a thousandfold rise in the cost-
effectiveness of microchips, governed by the centrifugal law of the microcosm,
rendered obsolete the dominant architecture of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
Most conspicuously, between 1977 and 1987 the percentage of total computer
power commanded by centralized systems dropped from nearly 100% to under
1%. Less obviously, but no less profoundly, the equally centralized structures
of television and telephony were also falling before the distributive force
of the microcosm. Ordaining that the price performance of microchips rises
by the square of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip,
the law of the microcosm exalts single chip systems, led by the PC. Pushed
into obsolescence were all monopolies and hierarchies, pyramids and power
grids of the old information structure, epitomized by the mainframe computer,
the broadcast network and the central telephone switch.<BR>
<BR>
The old establishment of AT&amp;T, the big three TV networks and some 1,400
over-the-air broadcast stations was breaking down into a new formation of
cable and wireless schemes. Affecting virtually every company in the economy
and threatening most existing management plans and practices, these trends
created huge opportunities for wealth creation and disruption.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with his move to Century City in Los Angeles in July of 1978,
Milken aggressively rode the microcosm--inside and outside of Drexel. Inside,
he concentrated on what Jensen describes as a key role of information technology:
&quot;taking the specific knowledge previously scattered through a firm
and making it into general knowledge usable by all.&quot; In this case,
it was a matter of turning Milken's command of the details of hundreds and
then thousands of high-yield issues into the foundation for a company that
could make these bonds the prime venture capital in the U.S. economy. From
the beginning, crucial to this goal was computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
A specialist in finance, information systems and operational research at
Wharton, he had begun his career at Drexel in 1970 with a computerized move
to speed up the delivery of securities to its customers, thus saving the
company some $ 500,000 in interest charges and setting a new standard in
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
In Los Angeles, he created an advanced system for trading based on what
was then a state-of-the-art Prime 550 Model 2. Through the RS-232 9600-baud
serial ports of up to 250 Televideo terminals, the Prime computer time-shared
a Fortran database containing the trading history of all Drexel customers,
some 1,700 high-yield securities and some 8,000 securities in the public
market.<BR>
<BR>
With a quick query, a member of Milken's team could determine the customer's
history, the amount of his potential profits or losses, his investment philosophy
and ability to buy new issues. Thus the team could link the buyers and sellers
of securities in a uniquely targeted and opportunistic way and could command
the detailed knowledge needed to counteract the strong prejudice and ratings
stigma against high-yield securities.<BR>
<BR>
Under William Haloc, a former systems analyst for Prime who joined Drexel,
the team also developed real-time analytics to allow instant calculation
of pricing for these intricate securities. These functions allowed salespeople
to view the name, issue and ratings of a security and to compute complex
yields and cash flows involving call features, sinking funds, refund schedules,
puts, warrants and prices, all instantly calculable on line. Meanwhile,
at rival firms, many dealers still fumbled with the levers on $ 3,000 Monroe
calculators.<BR>
<BR>
The entire system was monitored by Drexel Burnham's New York headquarters
and linked indirectly to the floors of the exchanges by Quotron, Reuters
and 10 other on-line services, each with a separate Rich monitor, switchable
from a keyboard. These arrays of small black monitors spread across the
desk collectively functioned like a present- day Windows display.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the features of Milken's system are Common today. But in 1980 they
were novel. This customized $ 2 million computer scheme, with five times
that amount for programming and maintenance, gave the Drexel team a mastery
of 5 the high-yield market that sometimes seemed positively sinister to
outside observers and competitors. But it was not magic or malfeasance;
it was the microcosm of the new technology joined with the knowledge and
investment genius of Michael Milken.<BR>
<BR>
More famously, Milken's grasp of the information age extended well beyond
Drexel's IS department. Focusing on emergent information companies responding
to the tectonic and regulatory turmoil unleashed by the microchip in TV
and telephony, Milken channeled a total of some $ 26 billion into MCI, McCaw,
Viacom, TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Cablevision Systems, News Corp. and other
cable, telecom, wireless, publishing and entertainment companies. At the
time, virtually none of these firms commanded substantial collateral acceptable
to a bank, and thus they could have raised these billions nowhere else.
Now, these companies are collectively worth some $ 224 billion and comprise
the foundations of a national information infrastructure unrivaled in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
With an eventual $ 2.5 billion from Drexel, MCI built the first national
single-mode fiber-optic network and spurred AT&T and Sprint into action
to give the U.S. a global lead in the technology. With another $ 1.2 billion,
McCaw launched the first national wireless telephone system. And with $
8 billion, TCI, Viacom, Time Warner, Cablevision Systems and Turner, followed
by many other Drexel high-yield issuers, made U.S. cable television a unique
national asset, with unequaled programming and broadband links. Redeemed
in the process were troubled companies providing equipment and services.
One of them was Corning, which supplied 62, 112 miles of state-of-the-art
fiber to MCI's pioneering network at a time when Corning had no other customers
for this crucial technology developed over the previous 17 years.<BR>
<BR>
Milken's influence reached well beyond his actual transactions. A once-lame
Disney was restructured with Milken's guidance and takeover pressure in
some three years of 5 a.m. meetings with Roy Disney, Frank Wells and Stanley
Gold. Then worth $ 1.8 billion, Disney emerged as a revamped Hollywood colossus
worth $ 30 billion 11 years later in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Comprising more than half of all high-yield bond issues, Milken's activities
also embraced thousands of companies beyond the telecom, cable TV and entertainment
field--for example, building Hasbro into the world's leading toy company
and Barnes & Noble into the leading independent bookseller. His example
helped inspire many rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann
Little, and Morgan Stanley, who also made heroic contributions to this campaign
of corporate renewal. In particular, Morgan Stanley channeled crucial billions
in high-yield funds to the computer, semiconductor and hard-disk drive industries
during extreme industry crises in the mid- and late 1980s as Drexel was
leaving the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1976 and 1993, Jensen calculates that in these campaigns of corporate
restructuring, American corporations conducted 42,621 merger and acquisition
deals worth a total of $ 3.1 trillion. In these transactions, selling: firms
won premiums of some 41%, generating $ 899 billion in constant dollar gains
to the shareholders. Since buying firms also gained on average, by increments
that increased over the years, Jensen's estimate represents a lower bound
on the yields of the restructuring movement.<BR>
<BR>
No substantial evidence supports the speculations by Larry Summers (now
Treasury Undersecretary) and others that these gains disguise large wealth
transfers from bondholders, workers, suppliers and communities. Indeed,
the evidence assembled by Jensen, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago,
Harvard economist Andre Schleifer and Jensen colleague Karen Wruck, among
others, shows that capital expenditures, employment, and research and development
all rose in the aftermath of these transactions.<BR>
<BR>
As Jensen now sums it up: &quot;These are lower-bound estimates because
they do not include gains that came about later or voluntary gains that
were achieved as a result of hostile offers. I don't know any way to add
up all these benefits. But it is clear that the impact was dramatic and
it left us much more competitive as a country. Today the Japanese and the
Europeans are suffering from their delay of restructuring and the U.S. is
much leaner and more efficient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Jensen and Milken agree that the opportunities today exceed even the
gains of the 1980s. Impelled by the restructuring campaign, the real value
of the equity of public firms more than doubled between 1981 and 1990, rising
by $ 1.6 trillion, or from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 3 trillion. Since then the
pace of technical change has accelerated and the possibilities for a deregulatory
breakthrough have soared with the election of a new Congress. Forbes ASAP
projects possible stock market gains for the rest of this decade of another
$ 2 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
The heightened pace of change, however, creates a desperate need for restructuring.
This $ 2 trillion opportunity depends on emancipating into the markets the
resources currently trapped in obsolete structures by capital gains taxes
near 40%, compounded by inflation, and by new antitakeover rules and outdated
telecom regulations. Flowing again into a new communications infrastructure,
into venture funds and into restructuring campaigns, freed capital can endow
entrepreneurs with the power to align their companies with the most potent
force in the history of technology.<BR>
<BR>
But first, America needs a new Milken. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Onrush of the Telecosm
</B></PRE>
With chip densities still doubling every 18 months and chip sales up nearly
30% each of the last two years, with computer MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) per dollar doubling every year and computer sales up over 25%
in each of the last two years, with hard-disk cost- effectiveness doubling
every nine months, and fiber-optics bandwidth exploding a thousandfold while
fiber deployment spreads at a pace of 1,300 miles a day--the onrush of technology
is now accelerating well beyond the pace of the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm is now potentially converging with
the law of the telecosm. This law ordains that the value and performance
of a network rise apace with the square of the increase in the number and
power of computers linked on it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers
and communications can ride an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
The 50 million new computers sold into America's homes and offices over
the last two years guarantee a huge market for broadband networks. Half
of the PCs sold in December bore Pentium microprocessors, and 60% of the
PCs went into homes. These computers process data at a pace rapidly approaching
100 MIPS. Early in the next century, just five years from now, most American
households will command multimedia teleputers processing data in billions
of instructions per second and pouring it out at gigabit-per-second rates--or
as much as a million times the current digital dribble of 9.6-kilobit modems.<BR>
<BR>
But not today. This computer-rich, bandwidth-poor situation means a crippling
and unnecessary mismatch between microcosm and telecosm, between the power
of PCs and the bandwidth of the networks that serve them--between PC instructions
per second on single-chip silicon and telco bits per second on twisted-pair
copper wires. Tens of millions of PC owners are demanding electronic commerce,
distance learning, full-motion videoconferencing, and ready access to the
graphics and hypertext of the Internet. World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Yet phone and cable executives dawdle with market surveys and experiments
with interactive TV that amazingly manage to prove that people don't even
want full-motion movies. Meanwhile, the values and sales of their companies
languish. In the last 12 months, for example, the 24 leading telecom and
cable companies, led by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, lost an average
of 12.8% of their market value. Facing a world of shining broadband opportunities
in their own businesses, narrowband executives grope for glamour in Hollywood
and grasp for growth overseas.<BR>
<BR>
American industry is still cowed by overreaching regulators obsessed with
corporate power. In a world of exploding competition in the telecosm -galvanized
by new wireless and wireline technologies emerging every week--the administration,
the FCC and Congress have long been paralyzed by nightmares of John Malone
of TCI and a possible single- wire stranglehold in St. Louis or of a blight
of disinvestment in phone service for South Dakota or Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
If current fears of monopoly result in a contrived two-wire mandate on America's
communications infrastructure, however, all the hopes for an integrated
broadband two-way net will die until well into the next century. With oceans
of bandwidth languishing just out of reach, the tremendous resource of broadband
home computers will waste away, gasping on the beach for two-way channels
for teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine and telecommerce, while
the telephone and cable companies &quot;compete&quot; with rival offerings
of mostly one-way floods of movies, shopping and the Sega Channel for TVs.
By betraying its precious world- leading endowment of PCs in order to save
its existing telcos and TV companies, the U.S. still could make a literal
$ 2 trillion mistake. 
<PRE><B>

The Amazing Vindication of Junk
</B></PRE>
To grasp the size of possible opportunity and the possible mistake, let
us return to Milken and his achievement of the 1980s, which set the stage
for the current drama. Never in history has a convicted white- collar felon
been so luminously vindicated by the passage of time. His six alleged felonies
dwindled to a series of debatable violations, devoid of insider trading
and essentially costing their victims nothing (or a total of $ 318,082,
according to a dubious estimate by the court that forced him into a plea
through RICO threats against him, his family and Drexel). Returning to the
volumes of the 1980s peak, his supposed Ponzi scheme of junk finance became
the most profitable class of domestic fixed-income securities of the early
1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if the few Savings & Loans that held a substantial portfolio of
junk had been permitted to keep it, they would have survived, prospered
and paid millions of dollars of taxes rather than collapsed into the hands
of the FDIC. For example, the shareholders of Columbia Savings & Loan may
have suffered from Thomas Spiegel's undue extravagance in company jets and
bullet-proof bathrooms. But the government crackdown cost them $ 700 million
and cost the taxpayers $ 1 billion, though the bank was on track to profit
massively from falling interest rates on its deposits and thriving high-yield
securities.<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs such as ex-Drexel luminary Leon Black, who purchased the bonds
from the government at bargain-basement rates, became billionaires on the
proceeds and were charged with gulling the regulators. Meanwhile, the companies
that Milken financed with these securities now form the foundations of a
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
A minor triumph came at the end of 1994 when Vanity Fair magazine, avid
vessel of many a lurid exposed of Milken and his team, published a lavishly
photographed story on &quot;America's New Establishment.&quot; Among the
19 names were Ted Turner, Craig McCaw, Sumner Redstone, Gerald Levin, John
Malone, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Ronald Perelman and
Bill Gates. Although Milken was never mentioned, all these high fliers--with
the exception of Gates--rose to prominence largely or partly on a cresting
tide of Milken's junk.<BR>
<BR>
Why does junk work! Primarily because it frees capital from corporate bureaucracy
and gets it into the hands of entrepreneurs. During the 1980s, lower taxes
and new technologies had transformed the economic environment. What was
precious in the 1970s--metals, minerals, real estate and collectibles, all
mashed together in diversified conglomerates and tax shelters-became disposable
junk in the 1980s. What was junk in the 1970s and early 1980s--Milken's
array of leveraged cable, fiber, wireless and content schemes--became the
precious foundations of a new information infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
How could this be so? How could one man with a poorly named venture-debt
financing vehicle contribute so hugely to the U.S. economy while, according
to Jensen's analysis, the nation's 500 largest corporations, led by a $
100 billion opportunity loss at General Motors in 11 years, incurred negative
returns with their free cash flow (cash flow beyond the amount needed to
fund all internal investments with a positive net present value)?<BR>
<BR>
Did not Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller win a Nobel prize for their
so-called M&M theorems showing that the performance of corporations is independent
of their capital structure? Have not scores of economists pursuing the Efficient
Market Hypothesis demonstrated that in general the capital exchanges are
fully efficient, that company prices reflect all of the available information
and no individual investor can systematically outwit the tape without illegal
manipulation or insider trading?<BR>
<BR>
In his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 1993,
however, Jensen answered all these arguments. On the basis of new research
on the experience of the 1980s, he declared that the M&amp;M theorems, &quot;while
logically sound, are empirically incorrect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The central problem of the corporation, according to Jensen, is the &quot;agency&quot;
dilemma-the divergence between the interests of the managers and the owners
of large businesses. This problem is inherent in all cooperative human endeavor:
the interests of the individuals always deviate at the margin from the goals
of the group. But in times of rapid technological and political transformation,
as Jensen argues, the agency gap becomes a gulf. The structure of the corporation,
the training of its engineers, the skills of its executives, the costs of
its processes all become misaligned with the realities of a new technological
base, a rapidly changing state of the art, and a political environment in
upheaval.<BR>
<BR>
General Motors was the worst example, investing $ 121.8 billion during the
1980s in R&amp;D and capital equipment while the value of the company dropped
to $ 22.9 billion. IBM invested $ 101 billion while its value was dropping
to $ 64.6 billion by the end of 1990 (on the way to further collapse to
$ 41 billion in early 1995). Collectively, the 500 largest U.S. corporations
wasted hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow. What was needed,
according to Jensen, was a total overhaul of most of these companies, their
strategic redirection, and the replacement or redeployment of roughly half
of the existing managers. What occurred was a prodigal waste of resources
in defense of the obsolete structures and practices of the incumbent management.<BR>
<BR>
Creating most of the new value during the 1980s were companies funded or
restructured by corporate raiders, venture capitalists and even--in the
case of a $ 75 billion gain from the AT&T breakup--the courts (disbanding
a monopoly previously created by government). Using equity, venture capitalists
overcome the agency gulf by playing an active controlling role on company
boards and managements and by insisting that executives are compensated
chiefly through stock and options. Using venture debt and an array of complex
securities, Michael Milken overcame the agency gulf by similarly active
intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Millken channeled billions of dollars into companies such as McCaw or MCI
largely owned by the management, to compete with industry leviathans. For
companies not owned by their executives, he funded leveraged buyouts that
transformed nonowner managers feeding on free cash flow into heavy owners
of equity with virtually no liquid resources. Contracted to divert all their
free cash flow to the holders of high-yield debt, the new owner-managers
were forced to please the capital markets in order to fund any new projects.
<PRE>
<B>
The Productivity Boom</B></PRE>
With the agency problem solved, these companies became lean and mean leaders
of the global economy. Contrary to the claims of many economists, from Alan
Blinder to Lester Thurow, productivity soared. Mired in the murky data on
service-sector productivity--which was stultified by the practice of measuring
most outputs by the cost of the inputs--economists tended to miss the prodigious
real growth of the 1980s. For example, in the brokerage and finance arenas,
productivity stagnated in the data, but between 1973 and 1987 the number
of shares traded daily grew from 5.7 million to 63.8 million, while employment
only doubled in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Manufacturing productivity numbers, though more accurate, also suffer from
severe miscalculations. In a world of creative destruction, they tend to
assume that products, such as computers, that decline in price are dropping
in value. And while registering every new steel ingot, automobile or chocolate
bar, they assume that novel products represent no productivity gain at all.
These are not trivial mistakes. During the past 20 years, the cost of computers
has dropped approximately one millionfold. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics
shows merely an annual drop varying between 14.9% in 1992 and 6.7% in 1994.
The government has finally recognized the flaws in this statistical series,
and is moving ever so slowly to correct it. But the problem is fundamental.<BR>
<BR>
Using the criteria applied to productivity in the auto industry, the statisticians
would have to multiply the improvement in computing cost-effectiveness by
the increase in the number of computers sold. Thus, with the explosion of
sales of billions of microcomputers of all kinds, from desktop systems to
embedded devices, a consistent BLS would find that the contribution of computers
to gross domestic product was close to a billion times larger than the entire
GDP of 1970. Of course, such an exercise would be preposterous. But hardly
more preposterous than mostly ignoring the productivity gains in these industries
of rapid advance, plummeting prices and cornucopian innovation.<BR>
<BR>
Even using existing data, total factor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing
sector more than doubled during the 1980s from the level during the previous
30 years. From 1950 to 1980, this productivity index rose an average of
1.4% per year; between 1981 and 1990, it rose at a rate of 3.3%. Labor productivity
rose from 1.4% per year in the earlier period to 3.8% in the `80s. Contrary
to the usual claims, wages rose at least 10%, according to Social Security
system data, while the number of jobs rose by 18 million.<BR>
<BR>
But the most striking productivity surge came in the growth of the productivity
of capital. In essence, Milken, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann Little
and others took the vast incarcerated capital resources trapped in old-line
businesses and put it back into the markets. Not only was the productivity
of the capital left behind hugely enhanced by the disciplines of restructuring,
but the freed capital flowed into venture funds and high-yield markets where
it fueled what Jensen calls &quot;a Third Industrial Revolution.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The results were dramatic. In decline for 30 years, at an annual rate of
minus 1.03%, the capital productivity index has long been beloved by Marxists
as a portent of the collapse of capitalism. During the 1980s, however, this
decline was decisively reversed. The productivity of capital as measured
in the data rose by 2.03% annually as computerized information systems transformed
the technology of finance.<BR>
<BR>
Decisively reversed as well was a long decline of U.S. market share in the
global economy. By the period between 1987 and 1992, U.S. corporations were
generating 47.7% of all the profits in the industrial world on 37.5% of
the revenues. Spearheading the U.S. economy were information firms, with
some 70% of global profits.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was overthrown by the restructuring of the 1980s all the indifference
theorems, Efficient Market Hypotheses, corporate optimality concepts, macroeconomic
monotheories wielded in business schools and economics departments to explain
away the power and &quot;wash&quot; away the paramount worth of individual
entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, the giant corporation, with managers
largely free of ownership claims, gained its preeminence as a way of diffusing
risk among millions of stockholders with diverse portfolios. But with the
securitization of venture debt by Michael Milken and others, these behemoths
emerge as marketplace survivors largely because of their prowess at politics,
litigation and media management--core competencies that in the course of
a decade succeeded both in derailing the Milken threat and enacting laws
and regulations to forestall any followers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because of a bias in favor of the capitalists, Jensen's course vies
with Michael Porter's similarly entrepreneurial class as the most popular
in the last 15 years with students at Harvard Business School--a fact which
bodes well for the future of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen and Milken agree that today's economy faces technological transformations,
agency misalignments and restructuring chances even greater than the economy
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;The opportunity is truly huge,&quot;
says Jensen. ASAP estimates that in this 40% larger economy, there should
be a chance for Milkenesque investors to raise stock market value by more
than 67%, implying both a revitalized U.S. economy, a Dow level over 6500,
a Standard & Poor's Index exceeding 700, and a Nasdaq over 1400.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains, however, how to realize these gains. Because of the
incredible continuing grip of obsolete regulations and the huge mismatch
between microcosm and telecosm, the fabulous new fiber and wireless technologies
have yet to force a corresponding industrial restructuring. The same old
players are still on the field protected by the same government rules, administered
still by Judge Harold Greene in the Modified Final Judgment breaking up
AT&T 11 years ago, and regulated still by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Justice Department and 5O state Public Utilities Commissions as if history
had stood still. Forty million computers with multimedia powers remain stranded
in homes with four-kilohertz copper connections to the world while communications
companies still ponder the perplexities of interactive TV and regulators
ruminate about how to prevent monopoly and preserve universal service. 
<PRE><B>

Cable TV's Impending Death</B></PRE>
Capsizing this entire teetering apparatus of petty fears and pettifoggery
will be this year's ascent of new wireless technologies. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs 10 to 30 times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
By nature, the U.S. Senate is dominated by rural customers. Many are Republicans.
Therefore, universal service has posed a paralyzing problem for programs
of deregulation. But new wireless digital technologies have utterly banished
this problem.<BR>
<BR>
At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the gap in costs between rural and urban customers. At
the same time, with supreme universality across the entire continent, Direct
Broadcast Satellite already delivers service superior to cable. Already
in the sky, DBS is a big bang that will ultimately transform the entire
corporate landscape of U.S. communications with a cascade of imperious new
realities.<BR>
<BR>
In digital DBS, GM Hughes, Hubbard Broadcasting and Thomson's RCA have delivered
a knockout new conduit for delivering one-way video. In image resolution,
in audio quality, in number of channels and in raw reach and efficiency
of point-to-multipoint transmission, DirecTV not only decisively outpaces
even the studio offerings at cable company headends but also vastly and
instantly excelled them in coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the only weakness of DBS is a lack of certain critical content
such as local and broadcast network programming. The lack will be addressed,
with the help of Michael Milken, by major new restructuring this year.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely devastating to broadcast cable TV, a still more powerful DBS
will send reverberations throughout the broadcast industry and profoundly
affect computers, government regulators and telephone companies as well.
As Milken explains, &quot;Everything in the information economy is connected
to everything else.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As government regulators will be the last to notice, DBS utterly overthrows
the prime premise of cable regulation: the view that cable commands some
kind of monopoly in delivering one-way video programming. Far from a monopoly,
one-way cable TV is essentially dead. In response to DBS, cable has no choice
but to change its business radically to two- way computer services.<BR>
<BR>
The market opportunity is obvious and immense. The Internet boasted five
million host computers and over 30 million estimated users in January, and
growth of 26% in the last quarter of 1994. The largest spurt of expansion
in recent history, this surge came despite acute frustration at the narrow
bandwidth of available phone connections.<BR>
<BR>
At present, only the cable TV industry commands conduits to homes capable
of accommodating these multimedia teleputers. One-gigahertz cable TV coax
can accommodate some eight billion bits per second of two- way data or some
5,000 channels of the kind of MPEG1 video now offered in one direction by
DBS. Such bandwidth could accommodate ubiquitous videoconferencing and commerce.
By contrast, your phone line modem labors to transmit 14.4 thousand bits
per second, or enough to send one MPEG movie in two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Reaching 63% of U.S. households, including at least 92% of homes with PCs,
cable supplies the obvious conduit for the exploding computer business.
Intel, General Instrument, Digital Equipment, Hybrid and Com21, among other
companies, are supplying cable modems and software for high-speed bidirectional
traffic over the existing cable plant. But consummation of the network will
entail large investments in fiber and switching at a time when cable is
just emerging from its regulatory shadows into the deadly Ku-band radiance
of DBS.<BR>
<BR>
The most obvious source of capital is the RBOCs, the local telephone companies
(though Milken stresses that the public utilities are a major alternative).
The Bells already command nine times as much fiber as cable TV does and
invest every year more money than the total $ 23 billion of cable revenues.
What they lack is bandwidth for broadband access to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The key to access to these huge new computer markets, therefore, is forthcoming
congressional action to permit collaboration between the RBOCs and the cable
companies within their own regions. If necessary, the telephone companies
must be allowed to buy cable companies and merge their systems. The coming
ascent of DBS should relieve the fears of monopoly that have long deterred
action. If it does, the cascade of change spurred by DBS will lead to a
flood of new commerce and communication on the networks of America.<BR>
<BR>
The endowment of DBS with new programming clout, however, will prove to
be the last triumph of conduit-content convergence. The restructuring paladins
of the broadband era will devote much of their efforts to dismantling the
content-conduit conglomerates that currently dominate the cable industry
and that are now in formation by the telephone companies.<BR>
<BR>
In a broadband era, content-conduit combines no longer make sense. Consider
that you are Warner Entertainment, a content company. You do not want to
restrict your movies to one conduit. You want to sell them through everyone's
conduit. Consider that you are Warner Communications, a cable firm. With
eight gigabits per second--enough for 5,000 movie channels--you want to
sell everyone's movies, not restrict yourself to Warner's.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to mix content and conduit--artists and engineers-produce misaligned
companies that need restructuring. Content follies crowd into the agency
gulf. Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis gave superagent Michael Ovitz
$ 14 million to pursue more &quot;content&quot; while Ameritech, BellSouth
and Southwestern Bell (SBC) romanced Disney.<BR>
<BR>
What would a new restructuring king do in the face of such ham- handed diversification?
Bring on the raiders. Sic some junkyard Doberman on the succulent bells
and whistles acquired by cable and telephone firms. Let him spin off their
recent acquisitions and interactive TV experiments and game channels and
refocus these companies on the computer networking business where they belong,
and where they can harvest the bonanza of a global economy rapidly uploading
onto the Net. 
<PRE><B>


The Two-Wire Delusion
</B></PRE>
Washington has to make a choice. Is it going to allow a freedom model that
permits telephone companies and cable companies to combine as common carriers
to build a true broadband infrastructure, in which millions of entrepreneurs
can cavort and compete in content and context? Or will regulators impose
a spurious competitive model, with two or more wires to every home, all
imitating the current cable strategy of wannabe content-conduit monopolies.<BR>
<BR>
As venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned in the Feb. 27 issue of ASAP:
&quot;There is an unspoken assumption in government circles that we can
move local loop communications to a fiercely competitive business model
and build an information superhighway at the same time...an implicit assumption
that the regional Bell operating companies and the cable companies are a
bunch of knuckle-dragging dimwits who will build the superhighway no matter
what... [But] telecom businesses are characterized by high fixed costs.
There is no such thing as limited competition... As you infuse competition...the
value model of the industry collapses. And when it does, the effect will
be exactly the same as stepping on a large cow pie in your hiking boots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Congressman Jack Fields, new Republican chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee,
disagrees: &quot;I am convinced that the [industry] people we talked with
will respond to telecom reform. They have tens of billions of dollars parked
on the side of the information superhighway waiting for us to pass a piece
of legislation to give definition and certainty to the scene.&quot; But
the people he consulted--chiefly the leaders and the lobbyists of the RBOCs
and cable companies--are not the ones who will decide whether the highway
is built.<BR>
<BR>
Making that decision will be the same capital markets that punished Bell
Atlantic and TCI for their broadband plans and thwarted the merger between
them. As soon as it became clear--through the passage of the cable re-regulation
act of 1992 and related policies of the FCC--that the regulators would permit
collaboration only in regions where the two companies had no competitive
advantage, the case for the combine collapsed. Under a regulatory system
in which the government can sweep down and confiscate profits and channel
them into quixotic schemes of universal service in three dimensions for
the homeless or require irrational competitive behavior in a two-wire multisubsidiary
world, a true broadband two-way network makes no business sense. What will
emerge instead is an array of dueling brands of 500-channel TV, claiming
to be interactive for the benefit of Congress and the press.<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets will avoid cow-pie competition at all costs. Under these
circumstances, a true broadband system will not be completed until 2020
in the U.S. But the competitive model is fundamentally misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
To the Washington regulators and their elected allies, competition has always
meant rivalry between the existing competitors--long distance, broadcast,
Baby Bells and Cable TV--and the regulation succeeds as long as all the
teams stay on the field. But all technological competition--all innovation--consists
of the pursuit of fugitive positions of monopoly. Current legislative proposals
from the administration and its congressional allies resemble a broad national
effort in 1981 to defend the mainframe BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell) from imperial IBM. Just as the IBM &quot;monopoly&quot;
was about to fall before the microcosm, led by Intel and Microsoft, so the
RBOC and broadcasting &quot;monopolies&quot; are about to fall before the
telecosm of broadband digital computer networks, which will also sorely
challenge Intel and Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
The new information infrastructure will bring a cornucopia of new services
from a variety of new sources that cannot even be defined as yet. All we
know is that none of the existing rivals is likely to survive in recognizable
form. Only a true freedom model that allows a complete reconstruction of
the world of communications--with anyone collaborating or competing, merging
or metamorphing with anyone rise--can allow this new era to come to fruition.
Only a freedom model can release the $ 2 trillion of new asset value that
the scholars of restructuring promise for the U.S. economy of the 1990s
and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
This result the Republicans on Capitol Hill command the unique and precious
and passing opportunity to achieve. So open the floodgates of capital for
new corporate raiders and remakers, venturers and reinventors. Rejoice in
the return of Milken and pray that he be joined by scores of rivals, including
those allowed to use the securities markets. Virtually all the cable and
telephone companies, from MCI to TCI to SBC, should be up for grabs, by
each other and from outside firms. Sitting on $ 10 billion of cash, IBM
could fruitfully enter the fray, or be frayed itself. IBM could combine
its global ATM network with cable access to homes. For many of these companies,
capital is far less scarce than vision.<BR>
<BR>
Milken cites MCI. &quot;Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with
billions of dollars of capital expenditures to make. They had a clear understanding
of what their business was. We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital and that fueled the spread of fiber optics throughout the country
during the 1980s. Today their situation is far less clear. They have $ 3
billion in cash, they could borrow $ 6 billion more; they've got a strategic
worldwide partnership with British Telecom. Today the challenge is not capital.
It is vision. It is, what should MCI's future be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With MCI's current resources, it could buy cable facilities across the country,
join them with its fiber network, complement them with wireless personal
communications services and Internet connections, and outwit AT&T as brilliantly
as it did in the 1980s. But it has to be willing to bet the company again.
The question is whether the current management, with Bill McGowan in his
grave, can escape the agency trap, shun the cushions of large corporate
life, and become a real competitor again rather than a protected player
in a continued government sham of &quot;competition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When a visitor at one of the Capitol Hill offices in charge of telecom policy
points to the benefits of real competition and restructuring, the politician
will usually respond: &quot;The companies do not tell us that.&quot; The
dirty little secret of all too many telephone and cable companies is that
they prefer government-regulated &quot;competition&quot; to real entrepreneurial
risks and rewards. As long as telco and cable lobbyists fail to urge true
competition, these companies deserve much of the blame. for the Third World
regulations that still limit the horizons of their industry.<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly, however, the situation is changing from an unexpected source.
While much of industry still lags, the politicians seem ready at last to
seize the day with a new freedom model. Now the congealed glaciers of telecom
can begin to break up under the blows of a reinvigorated market for corporate
control.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, the best solution will be again to deregulate Milken. 
<PRE><B>

Postscript: The Return of Mike Milken</B></PRE>
One morning, in his office on a quiet street in Los Angeles near Bel Air,
Milken is probing some of the outward edges of the new regime, delving into
a business plan for ridefilms. Ridefilms are a brand new industry of convergence
that blends features of theatrical films, theme- park rides and arcade games.
Giving the viewer the sensation of plummeting motion and soaring flight
on platforms that move in sync with motion on the screen, these systems
are virtual reality that really works.<BR>
<BR>
Presenting the project of the day is Whitmore Kelley of Berkshire Motion
Pictures, the firm that created the pioneering &quot;Back to the Future:
The Ride&quot; for Universal Theme Parks. He is proposing Ridetime, a low-cost
system of theater capsules for children between the ages of four and 10.<BR>
<BR>
These turnkey theaters could bring ridefilms to malls, shopping centers,
toy stores, theme parks, resorts, restaurants and family entertainment centers
at a toll of $ 1.50 per child, eight children at a time. Offering four-minute
musical adventures with engaging plots and educational themes, these systems
would be the first to shun the &quot;testosterone market&quot; of the arcades
and focus on young children.<BR>
<BR>
Milken had heard enough. He confessed he had only been able to read five
sections of the business plan during the two or three minutes that had elapsed.
But with a quizzical Columbo look, he said he had some questions. He had
recently seen similar systems in Norway and Sweden. Small groups of parents
and kids together paid the equivalent of $ 4 apiece to plummet down an Olympic
Alpine downhill or bobsledding course. No, they weren't real ridefilms,
with synchronized physical movement, but they were cheap to produce and
offered a similar experience and there would be a lot more where those came
from. How would Berkshire compete with these? Let's say he owned space in
an arcade. Teenagers pump in money all day long and deep into the night.
Why would he give space to a children's ride that takes up twice as much
room and closes down at bedtime? Interactivity? Watch out for that. Kids
today get real interactivity on their computers and Nintendo machines at
home. Any effort to provide interactive features for eight kids at once
might well turn them off. Where would the parents be? They would see the
show for nothing, standing behind the kids, without the motion that makes
it interesting. That's a downer. A four-year-old will demand that the parents
sit with him. The parents are your customers. Make them pay and let them
ride.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting that Kelley had described other ridefilm companies as the competition,
Milken demurred. The computer software industry would be the competition.
He grilled Kelley on the size of the capsule, its cost per square foot,
its yield to the owner of the space in a mall, the quality of the images,
the nature of the liquid crystal projection technology.<BR>
<BR>
As Kelley described it, &quot;Milken is so mentally aggressive and determined
I was astonished. I came in and he began playing the flute and several other
instruments at once, and I had to figure out what the dance was and start
moving and shaking in time. Teaching, learning and testing at the same time.
. .he was amazing.&quot; At the end of the presentation, Milken announced
that he was impressed and would go visit a prototype of the new system nearby
in the L.A. suburbs.<BR>
<BR>
Or watch him on President's Day in a paneled room in Atlanta's Occidental
Grand Hotel. He is contemplating a new learning network as a climax to some
25 years and $ 250 million of Milken family ventures in the field of education.
Milken has assembled leading experts on education, film and finance to consult
with the CEO of the new project, Hamilton Jordan, recently of Whittle Communications.<BR>
<BR>
Milken began with the crucial rule that the educational network &quot;go
first to the home, later to the schools,&quot; rather than the other way
around (which was Whittle's mistake). &quot;The teachers themselves will
bring any good material into the schools,&quot; he said. He ended by suggesting
that the group had radically underestimated the size of their potential
market. He pointed to his earlier investment in Interface Group, the sponsor
of Comdex, recently sold to Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank
Corporation for $ 800 million. Virtual conferences and teleconferences for
training and education and lifelong learning could become a leading vehicle
of convergence, joining software, computers, consumer electronics, telephones
and even public utilities.<BR>
<BR>
As he summed up, he declared that the size of the educational market, appropriately
defined today to include corporate training, was not $ 400 billion as Jordan
had said, but more than $ 1 trillion. Visionary and trenchant as ever, lifting
the horizons of all around him, Milken was clearly back.

Breakup Candidates?
</B></PRE>
AT&amp;T: In both history and promise, AT&T may be the world's greatest
technology company, combining microcosm with telecosm more intimately than
any other. With Bell Labs, 59% of the long-distance market, and McCaw's
access to the local loop, AT&T today also should be one of the most valuable
companies in the world. But its management has reduced its market cap to
just over one times sales, making it nearly the cheapest major phone company
in the country. Bell Labs performed much of the early work on the vital
new multimedia communications technology of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM),
but a new startup named Fore Systems dominates the market with scores of
other companies. Judge Green broke up AT&T once. Smart management would
break it up again.<BR>
<BR>
TIME WARNER: Time Warner went to the well for high-yield securities in 1984
at the time of the Atari crash. It plunged deep into debt to save the company
and preserve it film assets. With Lorimar, it produced more than a third
of all TV programming; with Warner films, it was the dominant Hollywood
force; with Warner records, it ruled music; and with Warner Communications,
it was the second-biggest cable system. In other words, it followed the
content-conduit strategy. Unfortunately, this strategy twisted its Orlando
project into unprofitable knots. Mobilizing some of the best technology
in the world- Silicon Graphics 3D interface and servers, AT&amp;T ATM, Scientific
Atlanta's 64QAM transmission-Warner compressed it into a TV set-top box
and centralized server system focused on delivering movies over cable conduits.
This business won't pay for the plant. Perhaps belatedly recognizing this
problem, the company is now veering in the oppsite direction, ordering 1.5
million new analog set-top boxes for $ 250 million from General Instrument.
Don't they grasp the deadly meaning of the DBS big bang?<BR>
<BR>
This company needs restructuring to get ready for a broadband world. It
must spin off its precious content and transform its conduit to accommodate
the only real interactive machines with market penetration, namely PCS.<BR>

But I don't understand howIntel gets hurt unless it stops delivering the best price/performance microprocessors.The more network connectivity the more we need MIPS. Andy Grove is rightthat DSPs are just a complex way of getting more MIPS. Just because bandwidthreduces some of the need for compression doesn't mean bandwidth reducesdemand for cycles.<BR><BR>In any case Gilder is very stimulating even when I disagree with him, andmost of the time I agree with him.<BR><HR><B><TT>Nicholas Negroponte - Director,<BR>MIT Media Laboratory, Boston, MA</TT></B> <H3>Debunking Bandwidth:</H3>When our world is fibered, the planet is like a desktop. Earth is but abackplane for a single computer. True. But as mere humans, the bandwidthwe're really interested in is the one that exists between us and computers,be they the size of a cuff link or a country. That bandwidth is often onewe want to be smaller, not bigger. Most of us, most of the time, want lessbits, not more bits. Sure we want gigabits, but only for a few millionthsof a second at a time.<BR><BR>Remember the early days of computing when stacks of fanfolded output weredropped on an executive's desk? People caught on quickly; that was data,not information. Today, for some reason, we have forgotten some simple conceptsabout what constitutes meaning and understanding and where they come from.You. So while it is real easy to ship vast amounts of data and high-resolutionimages back and forth between computers and while it is suddenly possibleto ignore geographic constraints, let's not forget that in many cases &quot;lessis more&quot; when it comes to bandwidth.<BR><BR>Narrow channels force us to be smarter. Yes, bandwidth will be free, butso will computing. The future will not be driven by either MIPS or BPS,but information and entertainment content. Andy Grove does not need to worryabout John Malone or Bill Gates. He has to worry about Michael Ovitz.<BR><BR><HR><PRE><B>Mark Stahlman - President,New Media Associates,  New York, NY</B></PRE><H3>Bandwidth to Burn: Now What Do We Do?</H3>Gilder has made a case for vastly expanded bandwidth overwhelming the influenceof the steady march of computing power. [But] what new need will drive businessesto translate the inventions Gilder describes into significant new mediaopportunities?<BR><BR>Apparently, it's the need for video-on-demand. [But] if this were a plausiblemass market, the streets of New York would be filled with bicycle messengersdelivering Tom Cruise with bags of Chinese food. No, during the next fiveto 10 years, bandwidth will certainly be consumed in much greater quantities--butfor completely different reasons. We will dramatically extend ourselvesand our social relationships with video-telephones. We will consume substantialbandwidth by substituting bandwidth for gasoline--through telecommuting.We will network to multimedia databases (such as the current Internet-basedWorld Wide Web) and dramatically expand our range of social contacts--acrossborders, cultures and tribes.<BR><BR>Unfortunately for Gilder's bandwidth braggarts, these enormous markets willbe built using a telecommunications technology which began deployment over10 years ago--ISDN--and in which none of them has any important financialstake today. Unglamorous, ungainly, even downright ugly, ISDN (integratedservices digital network) will be supplied by old-time telephone companies(not cable companies) and it will be driven by the steady progress of personalcomputers--themselves now a 15- to 20- year-old industry. As has been widelynoted, we tend to overestimate (sometimes dramatically) the near-term impactof new technologies and underestimate the long-range effects.<BR><BR>In this age, new technology hype has become an epidemic. Reality itself,as it turns out, is far more interesting.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael Slater - President,MicroDesign Resources,and Editorial Director,Microprocessor Report,  Sebastopol, CA</B></PRE>Increasing bandwidth will provide computers with more information to process,and this will increase, not decrease, the computational requirements. Havinghigh bandwidth makes it possible for the interface nodes to be less intelligent,but this is not necessarily desirable. Furthermore, the time frame mustbe considered; high-bandwidth WAN (wide area network) connections are notgoing to be widely available for years, and in the meantime, computationalpower will continue to be critical as a way to mitigate bandwidth limitations.<BR><BR>No matter how much bandwidth is available, it is still very desirable tohave high-performance computational ability in desktop systems. Renderingof three-dimensional images from mathematical representations, for example,is something that has widespread application not only in games, but in otherconsumer applications (like home and garden design programs). Orders ofmagnitude more performance will result in direct improvements in such applications,and bandwidth is no substitute here.<BR><BR>Finally, with regard to the inclusion of signal-processing capabilitiesin general-purpose microprocessors, I disagree with Gilder's conclusionthat this will not occur. Minor extensions to general-purpose architectures,such as the ability to perform four 8-bit additions in parallel using thesame hardware that normally performs a single 32-bit addition, will providea significant boost for applications such as video decompression. The costof adding these features is small, and the benefit is great. Sun and HPhave already made such additions to their processors, and I expect Inteland other x86 vendors will do so in the future. Dedicated DSPs will alwaysbe able to provide higher performance, but the incremental cost/performanceof adding functions to the host CPU is superior.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael E. Treacy - President,Treacy &amp; Co.,  Cambridge, MA{Treacy is co-author of The Discipline of Market Leaders}</B></PRE>[Gilder's] view is rounded on the narrow philosophy of technological determinism.It is a peculiar and persistent form of myopia based on the wobbly assertionthat the best technology will win in the marketplace. He who rides the besttechnological wave will ascend to glory. Oh, if it were only so! If technologydetermined success, there would be no Microsoft today. By any reasonablestandards, MS-DOS, the foundation of Mr. Gate's empire, was an average technologywhen it was brought to market more than a decade ago. But Microsoft hadall the other elements that created a compelling value proposition for itscustomer.<BR><BR>Value is what customers want. Intel has got what it takes and has been avalue leader for many years. Andy Grove has already begun to direct Intel'sdevelopment portfolio toward communications opportunities. He has read thesignals and made the call, just as he did several years ago when he vacatedthe memory-chip business, in advance of grinding competition and shrinkingmargins. With constant vigilance and change, Intel's success can continuefor years to come.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Howard Anderson - Managing Director,The Yankee Group,and General Partner,Battery Ventures,  Boston, MA</B></PRE>George Gilder's analysis of the changes in the computing and communicationstradeoff is brilliant, concise, analytical--and flawed. His portrait ofthe rapid changes in communications and relative disadvantage of the old-linecomputer industry (Intel, etc.) does not overestimate the movement. It underestimateshow the next 10 years will be the decade of Bandwidth on Demand. Considerthis: <UL><LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of bandwidth will drop faster than the costof computing. <LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of switching will drop faster than the costof bandwidth. </UL>Historical examples: The cost of a T1 line (1.54 megabits) coast to coastin 1985 was $ 40,000/month. Today? Under $ 2,000/month, a drop of 95%.<BR><BR>Assume the following: by 2000, computing is free, and bandwidth is free.Now--design the future!<BR><BR>The amount of money spent on ATM Research and Development (Source: YankeeGroup ATM Planning Service): <UL><LI>1993:$ 335 million <LI>1994:$ 550 million <LI>1995:$ 950 million </UL>So Gilder is right on about the impact of ATM. In fact, Fore Systems, whereour sister company Battery Ventures is the second-largest outside stockholder,carries a market capitalization of $ 900 million--on a $ 60 million salesbase demonstrating that the ATM value is well known within the industry.<BR><BR>This past year, the Yankee Group trained 5,000 end-users on the use of ATMtechnology and the most frequently asked question was, &quot;How in theworld am I going to use all that bandwidth?&quot; But it was only 10 yearsago that users thought they would fall off the end of the earth if theywent faster than 2.4 kilobits!<BR><BR>Which leads to some immutable laws about networks, which Gilder alludesto: <UL><LI>Networks always grow. <LI>Networks always become more complex. <LI>Networks find applications that double the bandwidth needed every threeyears. <LI>The cost of bandwidth is artificially high. </UL>Andy Grove is right: &quot;Only the paranoid survive.&quot;<BR><HR><PRE><B>G. A. Keyworth, IIThe Progress and Freedom Foundation,Washington, D.C.</B></PRE>George Gilder's article goes yet another step in establishing him as theforefront signal-to-noise processor&quot; of information technology. Yet,I confess to being somewhat confused by it.<BR><BR>My dilemma resides in what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--thatwe humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through oureyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears. The kind of bandwidththat Gilder projects are important to machine-to-machine communications,i.e., to networks, but it is the computer (in some form, whether PC, PDA,digital-phone or digital-TV) that will continue to determine the &quot;match&quot;between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule.<BR><BR>Bandwidth is important, because it will make the connection a richer one,but the fact remains that we humans lack broadband input channel to accessall that bandwidth directly. And it is the computer that must bridge thatgap, keeping it in the driver's seat as we enter the realm of ubiquitous,connected computing.<BR><BR>Gilder's article makes an additional point, and one that falls too oftenon deaf ears in Washington. That is that bandwidth scarcity, the basis formuch of our telecommunications regulation, is an outdated concept. Onlymajor revamping of the government's role in telecommunications will permitthe natural competition between computing and communications to play out.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Eric Schmidt - Chief Technical Officer,Sun Microsystems,  Mountain View, CA</B></PRE>Gilder's article does a wonderful job showing the potential impact of thebandwidth revolution. Let me give you two examples of approaches in computersystems to exploit enormous bandwidth increases:<BR><BR>The speed of light is not doubling every 18 months. There is a revolutionin system design for small, fast machines just as significant as the onefor broadband networks in your article. What we call today &quot;large servers&quot;will in fact have to become physically very small. We are now approaching&quot;design for light speed&quot; in computer systems, and we have to keepour handy ruler, measured in nanoseconds, ready for each new board design.Light travels about four inches in a nanosecond in today's wires, so that,in a 500-megahertz (two nanosecond) computer design, we have less than eightinches of room for our signals to travel in a synchronous processor design(as most are). This means that the fastest computers in our future willalso have to be the smallest!<BR><BR>The backplanes of these machines have to be physically very short. The limitof a single backplane makes it hard to keep up with the improvements inprocessor speeds, using traditional backplane designs.<BR><BR>Switching becomes a core strategy for computer systems. Two approaches thatmerge switching and architecture are now popular. One, called DistributedShared Memory, uses a switching network to link cache-coherent memoriestogether. In DSM computers, the power of shared memory designs can be extendedover very high- speed switched memory networks. The other, called clustering,has been around for at least 15 years, and uses a switching network to linkcomputer systems. In this approach, applications are modified to share commondisks, peripherals and software.<BR><BR>Small size and switching are the future of high-performance computing. Bothare based on networking as their core. As the switched networks get fasterthese architectures will come to dominate computing. The fastest improvingtechnology, in this case networking, always drives the architecture. Thehollowing out of the computer occurs when high-performance computers trulyspan networks. ATM asynchronous transfer model, now in its infancy, is thelikely network for us to bet on.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Steven Dorfman - President,Hughes Telecommunications and Space Co.GM Hughes,  Los Angeles, CA</B></PRE>In &quot;Ethersphere&quot; (Oct. 10) Gilder offers the view that high- poweredgeostationary satellites--the mainstay, high-capacity platforms of our past,current and future service offerings--are already antiques, and soon willbe displaced entirely by thousands of low earth orbiting satellites. Thatthese highly touted systems are nonexistent, unlaunched and unproven [andrequire major technical breakthroughs] are details that conveniently escapeGilder's scathing assault on geostationary systems.<BR><BR>Gilder should recognize that new technology products are designed and broughtto market based on a host of considerations in addition to pure technicalfeasibility. Tradeoffs are--must be--made. But to Gilder, &quot;tradeoff&quot;would appear to be synonymous with &quot;sellout.&quot;<BR><BR>In the corporate world, this is business naivet&Ccedil;. In deciding whatform Hughes's new Spaceway and DirecTV services, for example, should take,our goal was to deploy systems that: maximized technology insertion, therebyminimizing risk; provided a low-cost service for which there was demonstratedconsumer demand; and faced minimal regulatory, technology-development, orfinancing delays, thereby expediting service introduction.<BR><BR>A Ka-band GEO system, evolved from U.S. defense communication satelliteapplications, Spaceway is the logical extension of Hughes's universe of120,000 very small aperture terminal antennas worldwide, used for privatenetwork, two-way voice, data and video. Our me-satellite regional approachprovides global coverage at a cost of $ 3 billion. Because service can berolled out incrementally, revenues can be generated before full system deployment.(By contrast, virtually all 840 Teledesic satellites must be operational--ata $ 9 billion system cost--before service can begin.)<BR><BR>Our comparatively low investment cost and highly efficient spot beam architecture,whereby we cost-effectively target our capacity to the world's most populatedregions, yield significant savings and low user costs. . .critical becausedeveloping nations with limited communications infrastructure are a keymarket.<BR><BR>For voice, we expect that developing regions without access to low-costterrestrial voice service will embrace Spaceway despite the fractional timedelay--at least until terrestrial infrastructure is available. This is asignificant, revenue- generating window of opportunity for us. As for dataapplications, our VSAT experience has shown that custom developed protocolsprovide totally acceptable throughput efficiency and seamless interactivity.In short, we believe &quot;the delay issue&quot; has been overstated. Thereis a different delay issue, however, that cannot be overstated. Gilder is,I believe, overly optimistic about how soon Teledesic's technology willbe ready--and hence, how soon service revenues can be generated.<BR><BR>I believe Spaceway is the best technological solution for this market atthis time. But if tomorrow the technology and market are in place so thatthe LEO system makes sense, rest assured that Hughes will introduce an innovativeLEO product of Our own.<BR><BR>Gilder attaches far too little import and value (in the form of operatingprofits) to today's technology. Nowhere is this more clear than in his assessmentof satellite direct-to-home television programming. Gilder calls DBS &quot;one-size-fits-allprogramming,&quot; stressing its lack of sufficient consumer choice andabsence of Interactivity. But in holding out for a fiber solution, Gilderis making a poor business decision.<BR><BR>Today, Hughes's two DirecTV GEO satellites are filled with 150 program channels.We are adding 3,000 subscribers a day, and will break even (three million)by mid-1996. With 10 million subscribers projected by 2000, DirecTV willbe a $ 3 billion a year business, with $ 1 billion in operating profit.<BR><BR>Waiting for the future, Gilder, carries a price tag most CEOs can't afford,and are not prepared to pay. <PRE><HR></PRE><H2><CENTER>GEORGE GILDER REPLIES:</CENTER></H2>I want to thank my correspondents for their alternately poetic, ironic,trenchant and pithy responses. So many of them, though, share the notionthat I predicted dire straits for Intel that I must assume a lack d clarityin my treatment of the issue. I predicted that new and larger opportunitieswould arise in the field of communications processors and systems that centralprocessing units would bear a declining share of total processing not thatthey would in themselves decline in any absolute sense. Indeed, CPUs shouldcontinue to improve their cost-effectiveness apace with Moore's Law, plusan increment for architectural advances in parallelism. Such advances, however,will fail to keep pace with the onrushing expansion of bandwidth, as furtherdetailed by Howard Anderson's intriguing letter. Bandwidth gains will befed on the demand side, as Mark Stahlman incisively observes, more by theneeds of teleconferencing and telecommuting than by the need for one-wayvideo-on-demand.<BR><BR>Thus I agree with Bill Gates that Intel can continue to thrive as long asit continues to produce the most cost-effective microprocessors. I did raisethe possibility, foreshadowed by Microunity's new semiconductor lab process,that Intel's existing technology might face rivals that could produce moreMIPs or gigabits per second per watt. Power efficiency will be a crucialindex in a time of seething CPUs and increasing demands for power- savingdesigns from producers of mobile appliances, such as the digital cellularcommunicators which will be the most common PCs of the next decade.<BR><BR>Focusing on gigabits per second as a prime spec, these devices may welleclipse CPUs in raw processing pace and find a wide range of applicationsin digital radio, real-time compression and decompression, pattern recognition,echo- cancellation and other digital signal processing uses. The demandsof these applications have already impelled an array of processing and architecturaladvances at Microunity, Texas Instruments and elsewhere in the pullulatingfield of DSP. Unconstrained by proprietary legacies and immense installedbases, perhaps other manufacturers will also find ways to excel the Moore'sLaw pace of Intel's majestic progress down the learning curve of three-voltCMOS technology.<BR><BR>Jay Keyworth and Nicholas Negroponte both eloquently point to the centralparadox of the information age. While production systems of the industrialage use scarce resources, such as land, labor, and capital, to create abundance,production systems of the information age use abundant resources, such asbits and bandwidth, to create knowledge scarce enough to fit the bandwidthof humans. This distillation function--delivering correct and useful datato human beings with their Keyworth window of roughly 30 kilohertz cochleaand 30 megahertz retinas--requires processing speeds orders of magnitudeabove the human rates, just to sample, quantize and codify the flow. Toscan, select, recognize, correct, decompress, echo-cancel, visualize orotherwise manipulate the data entails still further accelerations of processingpower.<BR><BR>Communications processors may well emerge as most efficient for many ofthese tasks. The idea that all such functions will be sucked into the CPUhas a long history, but motherboards and their buses remain as crowded asever. I suspect that the bandwidth explosion will offer many opportunitiesfor processors specializing in communications.<BR><BR>Steven Dorfman of Hughes, I predict, will do better both for his companyand his two-way communications from space by moving quickly rather thanslowly to low earth orbits. I fully share his admiration for the point-tomultipoint-powers of DBS and I have long cited them as a prime reason forthe obsolescence of cable TV regulations based on the assumption of monopoly.Indeed, I predict far more than 10 million users by 2000 if Hughes and itssuppliers can meet the demand. But satellite and cable TV vendors will prosperbest by providing two-way channels for the 110 million personal computersin the land. I expect that these channels--particularly CATV, not ISDN--willprovide the dominant access channel for computers over the next decade.<BR><BR>Above all, I hope that whoever Andy Grove fears most, it is not MichaelOvitz. Grove goes Hollywood and we'll all be in trouble.<BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="49" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Andrew Grove, Titan of Intel, is widely known for his belief, born in the
vortex of the Hungarian Revolution and honed in the trenches of Silicon
Valley, that &quot;only the paranoid survive.&quot; If so, the Intel chief
may soon need to resharpen the edges of fear that have driven his company
to the top. Looming on the horizons of the global computer industry that
Grove now shapes and spearheads is a gathering crest of change that threatens
to reduce the microprocessor's supremacy and reestablish the information
economy on new foundations. Imparting a personal edge to the challenge are
the restless energies of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Tele-Communications
Inc.'s John Malone, providing catalytic capital and leadership for the new
tides of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Grove's response is seemingly persuasive. &quot;We have state-of-the-art
silicon technology, state-of-the art microprocessor design skills and we
have mass production volumes.&quot; These huge assets endow Intel as a global
engine of growth with 55% margins and more than 80% market share in the
single most important product in the world economy. Why indeed should Grove
worry?<BR>
<BR>
One word only may challenge him and with him much of the existing computer
establishment. Let us paraphrase a 1988 speech by John Moussouris, chairman
and chief executive of the amazing Silicon Valley startup MicroUnity, which
gains a portentous heft from being financed heavily by Gates and Malone:
If the leading sage of computer design, in his last deathbed gasp, wanted
to impart in one word all of his accumulated wisdom about the coming era
to a prodigal son rushing home to inherit the business, that one word would
be &quot;bandwidth.&quot; Andy Grove knows it well. Early this year he memorably
declaimed: &quot;If you are amazed by the fast drop in the cost of computing
power over the last decade, just wait till you see what is happening to
the cost of bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, is one of the
few men who have measured this coming tide and mastered some of its crucial
implications. His key insight is that the onrush of bandwidth abundance
overthrows Moore's Law as the driving force of computer progress. Until
now progress in the computer industry has ridden the revelation in 1979
by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors on chips,
and thus the price-performance of computers, doubles every 18 months. Soon,
however, Schmidt ordains, bandwidth will be king.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth is communications power--the capacity of an information channel
to transmit bits without error in the presence of noise. In fiber optics,
in wireless communications, in new dumb switches, in digital signal processors,
bandwidth will expand from five to 100 times as fast as the rise of microprocessor
speeds. With the rapid spread of national networks of fiber and cable, the
dribble of kilobits (thousands of bits) from twisted-pair telephone lines
is about to become a firehose of gigabits (billions of bits). But the PC
is not ready. Attach the firehose to the parallel port of your personal
computer and the stream of bits becomes a blast of data smithereens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tsunami of Gigabits<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The bandwidth bottleneck of telephone wires has long allowed the computer
world to live in a strange and artificial isolation. In the computer world,
Moore's Law has reigned. At its awesome exponential pace, computer price-performance
would increase some one hundredfold every 10 years. This means that for
the price of a current 100 mips (millions of instructions per second) Pentium
machine, you could buy a computer in 2004 running 10 billion instructions
per second. Since today the fastest bit streams routinely linked to computers
run 100 times slower, at 10 megabits per second on an Ethernet, 10 bips
seems adequate as a 10-year target. All seems fine in computer land, where
users rarely wonder what happens after the wire reaches the wall.<BR>
<BR>
In the face of the 10 times faster increase in bandwidth, however, Moore's
Law seems almost paltry. The rise in bandwidth does not follow the smooth
incremental ascent that the heroic exertions, inventions and investments
of Andy Grove and his followers have maintained in microchips. bandwidth
bumps and grinds and then volcanically erupts. The communications equivalent
of those 10 bips that would take 10 years to reach according to the existing
trend would be 10-gigabit-per-second connections to their corporate customers
next year.<BR>
<BR>
During the very period of apparent bandwidth doldrums during the 1980s,
phone companies installed some 10 million kilometers of optical fiber. So
far only an infinitesimal portion of its potential bandwidth has been delivered
to customers. Moussouris estimates that the bandwidth of fiber has been
exploited one million times less fully than the bandwidth of coax or twisted
pair copper.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the tide is now gathering toward a crest. This year, MCI offers
its corporate customers access to a fiber connection at 2.4 gigabits per
second. Next year that link will run at 10 gigabits per second for the same
price. Two years after that it is scheduled to rise to 40 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, at Martlesham Heath in the United Kingdom, home of British Telecom's
research laboratories, Peter Cochrane announced in early September that
he could send some 700 separate wavelength streams in parallel down a single
fiber-optic thread the width of a human hair. Peter Scovell of Northern
Telecom's Bell Northern Research facility declares that by using &quot;solitons&quot;--an
exotic method of keeping the bits intact at high speeds through a kind of
surface tension counterbalancing dispersion in the fiber--it will be possible
to carry 2.4 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) on each wave length
stream. That would add up to more than 1,700 gigahertz on every fiber thread.<BR>
<BR>
Blocking such bandwidths until recently was what is called in the optics
trade the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot; The light signals had to be
converted to electronic pulses every 35 kilometers in order to be amplified
and regenerated. Thus fiber optics could not function any faster than these
electronic amplifiers did, or between two and 10 gigahertz. In the late
1980s, however, a team led by David Payne of the University of Southampton
pioneered the concept of doping a fiber with the rare earth element erbium,
to create an all-optical broadband amplifier. Perfected at Bell Labs, NTT
and elsewhere, this device overcomes the electronic bottleneck and allows
communications entirely at the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
IBM's optical guru Paul Green prophesies that within the next decade or
so it will be possible to send some 10,000 wavelength streams down a single
fiber thread. Long prophesied by fiber optics pioneer Will Hicks, these
developments remain mostly in the esoteric domains of optical laboratories.
But IBM recently installed its first all-optical product--its MuxMaster--for
a customer running 20 wavelengths on a fiber connecting offices in New York
to a backup tape drive in New Jersey. Telephone companies from Italy to
Canada are now deploying erbium-doped amplifiers. Long the frenzied pursuit
of telecom laboratories from Japan to Dallas and government bodies from
ARPA to NTT (now turning private), all-optical networks have become the
object of entrepreneurial startups, such as Ciena and Erbium Networks.<BR>
<BR>
Returning from the ethers of innovation to existing broadband technology
connecting to people's homes, Craig Tanner of CableLabs in Louisville, Colo.,
maintains that a typical cable coax line can accommodate two-way streams
of data totaling eight gigabits per second. In Cambridge and other eastern
Massachusetts cities, Continental Cablevision is now taking the first steps
toward delivering some of this bandwidth for Andy Grove's PC users. Today,
using Digital Equipment's LANCity broadband two-way cable modems, David
Fellows, Continental's chief technical officer, can offer 10 megabits per
second Ethernet capability 70 miles from your office. That increases the
current 9.6 kilobits per second speeds of most telephone modems by a factor
of 1,000.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term contributor to the tides of bandwidth is a
new communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode. ATM is
to telecommunications what containerization is to transport. It puts everything
into same-sized boxes that can be readily handled by automated equipment.
Just as containerization revolutionized the transport business, ATM is revolutionizing
communications. In the case of ATM, the boxes are called cells and each
one is 53 bytes long, including a five-byte address. The telephone industry
chose 53 bytes as the largest possible container that could deliver real-time
voice communications. But the computer industry embraced it because it allows
fully silicon switching and routing. Free of complex software, small packets
of a uniform 53 bytes can be switched at enormous speeds through an ATM
network and dispatched to the end users on a fixed schedule that can accommodate
voice, video and data, all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Available at rates of 155 megabits per second and moving this year to 622
megabits and 2.4 gigabits, ATM switches from Fujitsu, IBM, AT&amp;T, Fore
Systems, Cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications and every other major manufacturer
of hubs and routers will swamp the ports of personal computers over the
next five years.<BR>
<BR>
Why should all this bandwidth arouse the competitive fire of Andy Grove?
The new explosions of bandwidth enable interactive multimedia and video,
riding on radio frequencies, into every household--through the air from
satellites and terrestrial wireless systems, through fiberoptic threads
and cable TV and even phone-company coax.<BR>
<BR>
If the personal computer cannot handle these streams, John Malone's set-top
boxes, Sega or Nintendo game machines or Bill Gates's new communications
technology will. A communications technology that can manage multimedia
in full flood can also in time relegate one of Grove's CPUs to service as
a minor peripheral. The huge promise of the PC industry, with its richness
of productivity tools and cultural benefits, could give way to an incoherent
babel of toys, videophones and 3D games.<BR>
<BR>
Redeeming the new era for the general-purpose PC entails overcoming the
technical culture and mindset of bandwidth scarcity. In today's world of
bandwidth scarcity, arrays of special-purpose microprocessors constantly
use their hard-wired computer cycles to compensate for the narrow bandwidth
of existing channels and to make up for the small capacity of the fast,
expensive memories where the data must be buffered or stored on the way.
This is the world that Intel dominates today--a world of CPUs incapable
of handling full multimedia and radio frequency demands, a world of narrowband
four-kilohertz pipes to the home accessed by modems at 9.6 kilobits per
second and a world of what Moussouris call arrays of &quot;twisty little
processors,&quot; such as MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) decoders from
C-Cube and IIT, graphics accelerators from Texas Instruments and an array
of chips from Intel.<BR>
<BR>
By fixing the necessary algorithms in hardware, these devices bypass the
time-consuming tasks of retrieving software instructions and data from memory.
Thus these chips can perform their functions at least 100 times faster than
more general-purpose devices, such as Intel's Pentium, that use software.
But all this speed comes at the cost of rigid specialization. An MPEG-1
processor cannot even decode, MPEG-2. When the technology changes, you have
to replace the chip. Such special-purpose devices now handle the broadband
heavy lifting for video compression and decompression, digital radio processing,
voice and sound synthesis, speech recognition, echo cancellation, graphics
acceleration and other functions too demanding for the central processor.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, contemplate a world of bandwidth abundance. In a world of bandwidth
abundance, specialized, hard-wired processing will be mostly unnecessary.
In the extreme case, images can flow uncompressed through the network and
onto the display. Bandwidth will have obviated thousands of mips of processing.
The microprocessor instead can focus on managing documents on the screen,
popping up needed information from databases, performing simulations or
visualizations and otherwise enriching the conference. The arrival of bandwidth
abundance transforms the computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Grove's and Intel's bold investments in chip-making capability --
some $ 2.4 billion in 1994 alone--the entire information industry has waxed
fat and happy on the bonanzas of Moore's Law. Now, however, some industry
leaders are gasping for breath. Exkhard Pfeiffer of Compaq has denounced
Intel's avid campaign to shift customers toward the leading-edge processors
such as Pentium, embodying the latest Moore's Law advances. Gordon Moore
himself has recently questioned whether the pace of microchip progress can
continue in the face of wafer factory costs rising toward $ 2 billion for
a typical &quot;fab.&quot; He has pronounced a new Moore's Law: The costs
of a wafer fab double for each new generation of microprocessor.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, but the new world of the telecosm offers no rest for weary microchip
magnates or future-shocked PC producers. Driven by the new demands of video
and multimedia, the pace of advance will now accelerate sharply rather than
slow down.<BR>
<H4>Feeding the Tiger</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplate the advance of the Tiger, Microsoft's all-software scheme for
video-on-demand based entirely on PCs. Although Tiger has been presented
as merely another way to build a &quot;movie central&quot; for cable headends
or telco central offices, its real promise is not to redeem the existing
centralized structure of video but to allow any PC owner to create a headend
in the kitchen for video-on-demand. Today, such capability would mean buying
a supercomputer plus an array of expensive boards containing special-purpose
processors. Tiger's consummation as a popular product therefore will require
a new regime of semiconductor progress.<BR>
<BR>
Driven by this imperative, a pioneering combine of Gates, Malone and Moussouris
is making an audacious grab for supremacy in the telecosm. Just three miles
from Intel and fueled by ideas from a 1984 defector from an Intel fabrication
team, Moussouris's MicroUnity is a flagrantly ambitious Sunnyvale, Calif.,
startup launched in 1988. Fueled by some $ 15 million from Microsoft and
$ 15 million from TCI, among several other rumored backers, it plans a transformation
of chip-making for the age of the telecosm, optimized for communications
rather than computations.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity's goal is a general-purpose mediaprocessor, software programmable,
that can run at no less than 400 billion bits per second--some hundreds
of times faster than a Pentium--and perform all the functions currently
done in special-purpose multimedia devices. Escaping the tyranny of fixed
hardware standards, the mediaprocessor could receive decompression codes
and other protocols, algorithms and services over the network with the video
to be displayed in real time.<BR>
<H4>The Great Bandwidth Switch</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In launching Tiger and MicroUnity, Gates and Malone are signaling a fundamental
shift in the industry. Ruling the new era will be bandwidth or communications
power, measured in billions of bits per second rather than in the millions
of instructions per second of current computers. The telecosmic shift from
mips to bandwidth, from storage-oriented computing to communications processing,
will change the entire structure of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the industry has been driven by increases in computer power
embodied in new generations of microprocessors--from the 8086 to the Pentium
and on to the P-6 and new Reduced Instruction Set screamers such as the
Power PC, Digital Equipment's Alpha and Silicon Graphics new R-1000 (the
latest in the family from Moussouris's previous company Mips Computer, now
owned by Silicon Graphics). External computer networks typically run much
more slowly than internal networks, the backplane buses connecting microprocessors,
memories, keyboards and screens. These buses race along at some 40 megabits
per second, up to Intel's new gigabit-per-second PCI bus. Even when computers
are linked in local area networks in particular buildings at 10 megabit-per-second
Ethernet speeds, they face a communications cliff at LAN's end: the four-kilohertz
wires of the telephone company. Under this regime, the processor is king
and Moore's Law dictates the pace of change.<BR>
<BR>
In the age of the telecosm, however, all these rules collapse. When the
network increasingly runs faster than the processors and buses in the PC,
the computer &quot;hollows out,&quot; in the words of Eric Schmidt. The
network becomes the bus and any set of interconnected processors and memories
can become a computer regardless of their location. In this bandwidth-driven
world, the key chips are communications processors, such as digital signal
processors (DSPs) and MicroUnity's mediaprocessors, which must function
at the pace of the network firehose rather than at the pace of the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, communications processors have indeed been improving
their price/performance tenfold every two years--more than three times as
fast as microprocessors. This kind of difference add up. Soaring DSP capabilities
have already made possible the achievement of many new digital technologies
previously unattainable. Among them are digital video compression, video
teleconferencing, broadband digital radios pioneered by Steinbrecher (see
Forbes ASAP, April 11, 1994), digital echo cancellation and spread-spectrum
cellular systems that allow 100% frequency reuse in every cell. All these
schemes require processing speeds far in excess of the bit rate of the information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in accord with the prevailing MPEG standards, digital video
compression produces a bit stream running at between 1.5 and six megabits
per second. But in order to produce this signal manageable by a 100 mips
Pentium, a supercomputer or special-purpose machine must process raw video
bit flowing 100 times as fast as the compressed format--uncompressed video
at a pace of 150 to 600 megabits per second. The complex and exacting process
of compressing this onrush of bits--compensating for motion, comparing blocks
of pixels for redundancy, smoothing out the flow of data--entails computer
operations running 1,000 times as fast as the raw video bits. That is, the
video compression algorithm requires a processing speed of between 150 and
600 gigabits per second--hundred of times faster than the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, just to digitize radio signals requires a sampling rate twice
as fast as the radio frequency--at a time when new wireless personal communications
systems are moving to the two gigahertz bands and wireless cable is moving
to 28 gigahertz. A broadband digital radio must handle some large multiple
of the highest frequency it will process. Code division multiple access
(CDMA) cellular systems depend on a spreading code at least 100 times faster
than the bit rate of the message.<BR>
<BR>
In order to feed the Tiger and other such bandwidth-hungry systems, communications
processors will have to continue this breathtaking binge of progress beyond
the bounds of the microcosm. Grove does not believe this possible. He contends
that the surge in DSP will dwindle and converge with Moore's Law, allowing
the central processor to suck in functions currently performed in digital
signal processors and other communications chips. DSP is nice, Grove observes,
&quot;but it is not free--unless, that is, it is performed in the Intel
CPU, obviating the need to buy a DSP chip at all.<BR>
<BR>
But in an era when the network advances faster than the CPU, it is more
likely that communications processors will gradually &quot;suck in&quot;
and &quot;hollow out&quot; the functions of the CPU, rather than the other
way around. Echoing Sun's perennial slogan, Schmidt predicts that the network
will become the computer. In this era, Moore's Law and the law of the microcosm
are no longer the driving force of progress in information technology. Bandwidth
is king.<BR>
<BR>
As the great pioneer of communications theory Claude Shannon wrote in 1948,
bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Since ultimately a microprocessor
is a set of millions of transistor switches inscribed on a chip, bandwidth
can even serve as a substitute for mips. With sufficient communication,
engineers can duplicate any computer network topology they want. As the
network becomes the computer, they thus redefine the optimal architectures
of computing. As an example, take the problem of video-on-demand now being
confronted by every major company in the industry from IBM to Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992, Microsoft assigned this problem to Craig Mundie, a veteran of Data
General in Massachusetts, who had gone on to found Alliant Computer, one
of the more successful of the massively parallel computer firms. As a supercomputer
man, Mundie initially explored a hardware solution, hiring a team of computer
designers from Supercomputer Systems Inc. SSI was Steve Chen's effort to
follow up on his successes at Cray Research with a machine for IBM. Although
IBM ultimately closed SSI down, Chen commanded some of the best talent in
supercomputers. Mundie hired George Spix and a team from SSI.<BR>
<H4>Looking to Software</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, video-on-demand seems a super-computer task. It entails
taking tens of thousands of streams of digital images, smoothing them into
real-time flows, and switching them to the customers requesting them. Essentially
huge hierarchies of storage devices, including fast silicon memories, connected
through a specialized switching fabric to arrays of fast processors, supercomputers
seem perfectly adapted to video-on-demand, which as Bill Gates explains,
is &quot;essentially a switching problem.&quot; This is the solution chosen
by Oracle Systems, using its nCube supercomputer, and by Silicon Graphics,
employing its PowerChallenge server.<BR>
<BR>
According to Mundie, the SSI team developed an impressive video server design.
But they soon discovered they were in the wrong company. As Gates told Forbes
ASAP, &quot;Microsoft looks for a software solution to all problems. IBM
looks for a mainframe hardware solution. Larry Ellison owned a supercomputer
company so he looked for that solution. Fortunately for us, software solutions
are the most scaleable, flexible, fault-tolerant and low cost.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Enter Rick Rashid, a professor from Carnegie Mellon and designer of the
Mach kernel adopted by Next, IBM and the Open Software Foundation and incorporated
in part in Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Rashid joined Microsoft
in September 1991 and began to focus on video-on-demand in 1992. Like most
other people confronting this challenge, he first assumed that the huge
bit streams involved would require specialized hardware--RAID (redundant
arrays of inexpensive disk) storage, fast buffer memories and supercomputer-style
switches. Soon, however, he came to the conclusion that progress in the
personal computer industry would enable an entirely software solution.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the memory problem illustrates a tradeoff between bandwidth
and processing speed. Expensive hierarchies of RAID drives and semiconductor
buffer memories managed by complex controller logic can speed the bit streams
to the switch at the necessary pace. But Rashid and Mundie saw that bandwidth
offered a cheaper solution. Through clever software, you could &quot;stripe&quot;
the film bits across large arrays of conventional disk drives and gain speed
through bandwidth. Rather than using one fast memory, plus fast processors,
and hard-wired fault tolerance to send the movie reliably to a customer,
you spread the images across arrays of cheap, slow disk drives--Seagate
Barracudas--which, working in parallel, offer bandwidth and redundancy limited
only the number of devices. Having dispensed with the idea of contriving
expensive hardware solutions for the memory problem, Rashid recognized that
with Windows NT he commanded an operating system with real-time scheduling
guarantees that laid the foundation for a software solution. On it, he could
proceed to build Tiger as a continuous digital stream operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Liberated from special-purpose hardware, the team could revel in all the
advantages of using off-the-shelf personal computer components. Mundie explains:
&quot;The personal computer industry commands intrinsic volume and a multi-supplier
structure that takes anything in its path and drives its costs to ground.&quot;
A burly entrepreneur of massively parallel supercomputers, Mundie became
a fervent convert to the manifest destiny of the PC to dominate all other
technologies in the race to multimedia services, grinding all costs and
functions into the ground of microprocessor silicon.<BR>
<BR>
Video-on-demand has been heralded as the salvation of the television industry,
the supercomputer industry, the game industry, the high-end server industry.
It has been seen as Microsoft's move into hardware. Yet nowhere in the Tiger
Laboratory in Building Nine is there any device made by any TV company,
supercomputer firm, workstation company, or Microsoft itself. On one side
of the room are 12 monitors. On the other side are 12 Compaq computers piled
on top of each other, said to be simulating set-top boxes. Next to these
are a pile of Seagate Barracuda disk drives, each capable of holding the
nine gigabytes of video in three high-resolution compressed movies. Next
to them are another pile of Compaq computers functioning as video servers.<BR>
<BR>
All this gear works together to extend Microsoft's long mastery of the science
of leverage, getting most of the world to drive costs to ground--or grind
cost into silicon--while the grim reapers of Redmond collect tolls on the
software. Exploiting another of Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy's famous
laws--&quot;The smartest people in every field are never in your own company&quot;--Gates
has contrived to induce most of the personal computer industry, from Bangalore
to Taiwan, to work for Microsoft without joining the payroll.<BR>
<BR>
In the new world of bandwidth abundance, however, it is no longer sufficient
to leverage the PC industry alone. Gates is now reaching out to leverage
the telephone and network equipment manufacturing industries as well. Transforming
all this PC hardware into a &quot;Tiger&quot; that can consume the TV industry
is an ATM switch. In the Tiger application, once one ATM switch has correctly
sequenced the movie bits streaming from the tower of Seagate disks, another
ATM switch in a metropolitan public network will dispatch the now ordered
code to the appropriate display. Microsoft's Tiger and its client &quot;cubs&quot;
all march in asynchronous transfer mode.<BR>
<H4>The Masters of Leverage</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is this a brilliant coup? It positions Microsoft to harvest the fruits
of the single most massive and far-reaching project in all electronics today.
Some 600 companies are now active in the ATM forum, with collective investments
approaching $ 10 billion and rising every year. Not only are ATM switches
produced by a competitive swarm of companies resembling the PC industry,
ATM also turns networks of small computers into scaleable supercomputers.
It combines with fiber-optic links to provide a far simpler, more modular
and more scaleable solution than the complex copper backplane buses that
perform the same functions in large computers. ATM and fiber prevail by
using bandwidth as a substitute for complex protocols and computations.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft Technical Director Nathan Myhrvold points to the Silicon Graphics
PowerChallenge superserver as a contrast. &quot;They have a bus that can
handle 2.4 gigabytes per second and which is electrically balanced to take
a bunch of add-in cards (for processor and memory).&quot; The complexities
of this solution yield an expensive machine, costing more than $ 100,000,
with specialized DRAM boards, for example, that cost 10 times as much per
megabyte as DRAM in a PC.<BR>
<BR>
This problem is not specific to Silicon Graphics. All supercomputers with
multiple microprocessors linked with fast buses face the same remorseless
economics and complexities. By contrast, the $ 30,000 Fore systems ATM switch
being used in Tiger prototypes--together with the PCI buses in the PCs on
the network--supply the same 2.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth that
the PowerChallenge does. And, as Myhrvold points out, &quot;ATM prices are
dropping like a stone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Microsoft sage explains: ATM switches linked by fiber optic lines are
far more efficient at high bandwidth than copper buses on a backplane. ATM
allows &quot;fault tolerance and other issues to be handled in software
by treating machines (or disks, or even the ATM switch itself) as being
replaceable and redundant, with hot spares standing by.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Gates told ASAP, video-on-demand is essentially a switching problem.
You can create an expensive, proprietary, and unscaleable switch using copper
lines and complex protocols on the backplane of a supercomputer, or you
can use the bandwidth of fiber optics and ATM as a substitute for these
complexities. You can put the ATM switches wherever you need them to create
a system optimized for any application, allowing any group of PCs using
Windows NT and PCI buses to function as video clients or servers as desired.
As Microsoft leverages the world, it won't object if the world chooses to
lift NT into the forefront of operating systems in unit sales.<BR>
<BR>
Mundie and his assistant Redd Becker earnestly explain the virtues of this
scheme and demonstrate its robustness and fault tolerance by disabling several
of the disk drives, cubs and servers without perceptibly affecting the 12
images on the screen. They offer it as a system to function as a movie central
server resembling the Oracle nCube system adopted by Bell Atlantic, or the
Silicon Graphics system used by Time Warner in its heralded Orlando project.
But the Tiger is fundamentally different from these systems in that it is
completely scaleable and reconfigurable, functioning with full VCR interactivity
for a single citizen or for a city. It epitomizes the future of computing
in the age of ATM, a system that will soon operate at up to 2.4 gigabits
per second. Two point four gigabits per second is more than twice as fast
as the Intel PCI bus that links the internal components of a Pentium-based
personal computer.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, ATM technology can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and an external Barracuda, between a video client and a video
server. To the CPU, a local area network or even a wide area network running
ATM can function as a motherboard backplane. With NT and Tiger software,
PCs will be able to tap databases and libraries across the world as readily
as they can reach their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives. Presented as an
application-specific system for multimedia or movie distribution in real
time, it is in fact a new operating system for client-server computing in
the new age of image processing.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Bell, now on Microsoft's technical advisory board, sums up the future
of computing in an ATM world: &quot;We can imagine a network with a range
of PC-sized nodes costing between $ 500 and $ 5,000 that provide person-to-person
communication, television and when used together (including in parallel),
an arbitrarily large computer. Clearly, because of standards, ubiquity of
service and software market size, this architecture will drive out most
other computer structures such as massively parallel computers, low-priced
workstations and all but a few special-purpose processors. This doomsday
for hardware manufacturers will arrive before the next two generations of
computer hardware play out at the end of the decade. But it will be ideal
for users.&quot; And for Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of equipment that feeds the Tiger, however, what Bell
calls &quot;doomsday for hardware manufacturers: may well be as profitable
as the current rage of &quot;Doom,&quot; the new computer game infectiously
spreading from the Internet into computer stores. The new Tiger model provides
huge opportunities for manufacturers of new ATM switches on every scale,
for PCs equipped with fast video buses such as PCI, for vendors of network
hardware and software, and perhaps most of all for the producers of the
new communications processors.<BR>
<BR>
For all the elegance of the Tiger system, however, Gates understands that
it cannot achieve its goals within the constraints of Moore's Law in the
semiconductor industry. The vision of &quot;any high school dropout buying
PCs and entering the interactive TV business&quot; cannot prevail if it
takes a supercomputer to compress the images and an array of special-purpose
processors to decode, decrypt and decompress them. Facing an ATM streams
of 622 megabits per second--perhaps uncompressed video, 3-D or multimedia
images--Eric Schmidt points out, a 100 mips Pentium machine would have to
process 1.47 million 53-byte cells a second. That means well under 100 instruction
cycles to read, store, display and analyze a packet. Since most computers
use many cycles for hidden background tasks, the Pentium could not begin
to do the job. Gate's adoption of Tiger, his alliance with TCI, his investments
in Teledesic, Metricom, and MicroUnity, all bring home face-to-face with
the limits of current computer technology in confronting the telecosm. With
MicroUnity, however, he may have arrived at a solution just in time.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity seems like a throwback to the early years of Silicon Valley,
when all things seemed possible--when Robert Widlar could invent a new product
for National Semiconductor on the beach in Puerto Vallarta, and develop
a new process to build it with David Talbert and his wife Dolores over beers
on a bench at the Wagon Wheel. It was an era when scores of semiconductor
companies were racing down the learning curve to enhance the speed and functions
of electronic devices. Most of all, the MicroUnity project is a climactic
episode in the long saga of the industry's struggle between two strategies
for accelerating the switching speeds in computers.<BR>
<H4>A New Moore's Law?</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel Chairman Gordon Moore recently promulgated a new Moore's Law, supposedly
deflecting the course of the old Moore's Law, which ordains that chip densities
double every 18 months. The new law is that the costs of a chip factory
double with each generation of microprocessor. Moore speculated that these
capital burdens might deter or suppress the necessary investment to continue
the pace of advance in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Gerhard (&quot;Gerry&quot;) Parker, Intel's chief technical officer, however,
presents contrary evidence. The cost for each new structure may be approximately
doubling as Moore says. But the cost per transistor--and thus the cost per
computer function--continues to drop by a factor of between three and four
every three years. Not only does the number of transistors on a chip rise
by a factor of four, but the number of chips sold doubles with every generation
of microprocessor, as the personal computer market doubles every three years.
Thus there will be some eight times more transistors sold by Intel from
a Pentium fab that from a 486 fab. At merely twice the cost, the new fab
seems a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Intel gets paid not for transistors but for computer functions.
To realize the benefits of the new fabs, therefore, Intel must deliver new
computer functions that successfully adapt to the era of bandwidth abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it is worth noting that measured in telecosmic terms of useful
terabits per second of bandwidth, a MicroUnity fab ultimately costing some
$ 150 million might generate more added value than a $ 2 billion megafab
of Intel.<BR>
<H4>Return to Low and Slow</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since as a general rule, the more the power, the faster the switch, you
can get speed by using high-powered or exotic individual components. It
is an approach that worked well for years at Cray, IBM, NEC and other supercomputer
vendors. Wire together superfast switches and you will get a superfast machine.<BR>
<BR>
The other choice for speed is to use low-powered, slow switches. You make
them so small and jam them so close together, the signals get to their destinations
nearly as fast as the high-powered signals. This approach works well in
the microprocessor industry and in the human brain.<BR>
<BR>
Despite occasional deviations at Cray and IBM, low and slow has been the
secret of all success in semiconductors from the outset. Inventor William
Shockley substituted slow, low-powered transistors for faster, high-powered
vacuum tubes. Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments replaced fast germanium with
slower silicon. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild spurned the fast track of mountainous
Mesa transistors to adopt a flat &quot;planar&quot; technology in which
devices were implanted below the surface of the chip. Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce then substituted slow resistors and capacitors as well as slow transistors
on integrated circuits for faster, high-powered devices on modules and printed
circuit boards. Federico Faggin made possible the microprocessor by replacing
fast metal gates on transistors with slow gates made of polysilicon. Frank
Wanlass and others replaced faster NMOS and PMOS technologies with the 1,000
times slower and 10 times lower-power Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors
(CMOS) that now rule the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Low and slow finds its roots in the very physics of solid state, separating
the microcosm from the macrocosm. Chips consist of complex patterns of wires
and switches. In the macrocosm of electromechanics, wires were simple, fast,
cool, reliable and virtually free; switches were vacuum tubes, complex,
fragile, hot and expensive. In the macrocosm, the rule was economize on
switches, squander on wires. But in the microcosm, all these rules of electromechanics
collapsed.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, switches are almost free--a few millionths of a cent.
Wires are the problem. However fast they may be, longer wires laid down
on the chip and more wires connected to it translated directly into greater
resistance and capacitance and more needed power and resulting heat. These
problems become exponentially more acute as wire diameters drop. On the
other hand, the shorter the wires the purer the signal and the smaller the
resistance, capacitance and heat.<BR>
<BR>
This fact of physics is the heart of microelectronics. As electron movements
approach their mean free path-- he distance they can travel &quot;ballistically&quot;
without bouncing off the internal atomic structure of the silicon--they
get faster, cheaper and cooler.<BR>
<BR>
At the quantum level, noise plummets and bandwidth explodes. Tunneling electrons,
the fastest of all, emit virtually no heat at all. It was a new quantum
paradox; the smaller the space the more the room, the narrower the switches
the broader the bandwidth, the faster the transport the lower the noise.
As transistors are jammed more closely together, the power delay product--the
crucial index of semiconductor performance combining switching delays with
heat emission--improves as the square of the number of transistors on a
single chip.<BR>
<BR>
Since the breakthrough to CMOS in the early 1980s, however, the industry
has been slipping away from the low and slow regime. Falling for the electromechanical
temptation, they are substituting fast metals for slow polysilicon. For
better performance, companies are increasingly turning to gallium arsenide
and silicon germanium technologies. Semiconductor engineers are increasingly
crowding the surface of CMOS with as many as four layers of fast aluminum
wires, with tungsten now in fashion among the speed freaks of the industry
. The planar chips that built Silicon Valley have given way to high sierras
of metal, interlarded with uneven spreads of silicon dioxide and other insulators.
Meanwhile, the power used on each chip is rising rapidly, since the increasing
number of transistors and layers of metal nullify a belated move to three-volt
operation from the five volts adopted with Transistor Transistor Logic in
1971. And as the industry loses touch with its early inspiration of low
and slow, the costs of wafer fabrication continue to rise--to an extent
that even demoralizes Gordon Moore.<BR>
<BR>
In radically transforming the methods of semiconductor fabrication, John
Moussouris and James (&quot;Al&quot;) Matthews, MicroUnity's director of
technology, seem to many observers to be embarking on a reckless and self-defeating
course. But MicroUnity is betting on the redemptive paradoxes of the microcosm.
Returning to low and slow, Moussouris and Matthews promise to increase peak
clock speeds by a factor of five in the next two years and chip performance
by factors of several hundred, launching communications chips in 1995 that
function at 1.2 gigahertz and perform as many as 400 gigabits per second.<BR>
<H4>Matthews and Mead</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pursuing this renewal of wafer fabrication at MicroUnity, Matthews has
applied for some 70 patents and won about 20 to date. A veteran of Hewlett-Packard's
bipolar process labs who moved to Intel in the early 1980s and spearheaded
Intel's switch to CMOS for the 386 microprocessor, Matthews has also worked
as an engineer at HP-Avantek's gallium arsenide fabs for microwave chips.
Commanding experience in diverse fab cultures, Matthews thus escapes the
cognitive trap of seeing the established regime as a given, rather than
a choice.<BR>
<BR>
At Aventek, Matthews plunged toward the microcosm and prepared the way for
his MicroUnity process after reading an early paper by Carver Mead, the
inventor of the gallium arsenide MESFET transistor. Mead had prophesied
that the behavior of these transistors would deteriorate drastically if
the feature sizes were pushed below two-tenths of a micron at particular
doping levels (technically impossible at the time). In the mid-1980s, though,
Matthews noticed that these feature sizes were then feasible. Testing the
Mead thesis, he was startled to discover that far from deteriorating below
the Mead threshold, these transistors instead showed &quot;startlingly anomalous
levels of good behavior,&quot; marked by high gain and plummeting noise.<BR>
<BR>
Based on this discovery, he created a low-noise, gigahertz-frequency amplifier
for satellite dishes being sold in the European market. Matthew's process
reduced the cost so drastically that Sony officials were said to be contemplating
claims of dumping. Avantek was charging a few dollars for microwave frequency
chips that cost Sony perhaps some hundreds of dollars to make.<BR>
<BR>
Having discovered the &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot; of gallium arsenide
devices pushed beyond the theoretical limits, Matthews at MicroUnity decided
to experiment with bipolar devices. Bipolar devices are usually used at
high power levels with so-called emitter coupled logic to achieve high speeds
in supercomputers and other advanced machines. Inspired by his breakthrough
with gallium arsenide, Matthews believed that biopolar performance also
might be radically different at extremely low power--under half a volt and
at gate lengths approaching the so-called Debye limit, near one-tenth of
a micron.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, Matthews was startled by &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot;
as processes approached the quantum mechanical threshold. It turned out
that at high frequencies biopolar transistors use far less power even the
CMOS transistors, famous for their low-power characteristics. At these radio-frequency
speeds, however, he discovered that the transistors could not operate with
aluminum wires insulated by oxide. Therefore, he introduced a technique
he had used with fast bipolar and gallium arsenide devices: gold wires insulated
by air. Replacing oxide insulators with &quot;air bridges&quot; drastically
reduces the capacitance of the wires and allows the transistor to operate
at speeds impossible with conventional device structures.<BR>
<BR>
With these adventures in the microcosm behind him, Matthews was ready to
develop a new process and technology for MicroUnity. Based on combining
the best features of biopolar and CMOS at radially small geometries, the
new technology uses bipolar logic functioning at gigahertz clock speeds,
with CMOS retained chiefly for memory cells and with gold air bridges for
the metalization layers. Perhaps it is a portent that the gold wires across
the top of the chip repeat the most controversial feature of Jack Kilby's
original integrated circuit. (Matthews is also seeking patents for methods
of using optical communications on the top of a silicon chip).<BR>
<BR>
In essence, Matthews is returning to low and slow. He is shearing off the
sierras of metal and oxides and restoring the planar surfaces of Jean Hoerni.
Because the surface is flat to a tolerance of one-tenth of a micron, photolithography
gear can function at higher resolution despite a narrow depth of field.
Elimination of the aluminum sierras also removes a major source of parasitic
currents and transistors and allows smaller polysilicon devices to be implanted
closer together. A major gain from these innovations is a drastic move to
lower power transistors. Rather than using the usual three volts or five
volts, the MicroUnity devices operate at 0.3 volts to 0.5 volts (300 to
500 millivolts). In the microcosm, smaller devices closer together at lower
power is the secret of speed.<BR>
<BR>
Although MicroUnity will not divulge the details of future products, ASAP
calculates on the basis of information from other sources that the MicroUnity
chip can hold more than 10 million transistors in a space half the size
of a Pentium with three million transistors. With lower power transistors
set closer together, the MicroUnity chip can operate with a clock rate as
much as 10 times faster than most current microprocessors and at an overall
data rate more than 100 times faster. Low and slow results in blazing speed.<BR>
<BR>
For ordinary microprocessor applications, an ultrafast clock is superfluous.
Since ordinary memory technology is falling ever farther behind processor
speeds, fast clocks mean complex arrangements of cache on cache of fast
static RAM and specialized video memory chips. By using the MicroUnity technology
at the relatively slow clock rates of a Pentium, MicroUnity might be able
to produce Pentiums that use from five to 10 times less power--enabling
new generations of portable equipment.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity, however, is not building a CPU but a communications processor.
In the communications world, the fast clock rate gives the &quot;mediaprocessor&quot;
the ability to couple to broadband pipes using high radio frequencies. Most
crucially, the mediaprocessor can connect to the radio frequency transmissions
over cable coax.<BR>
<BR>
Along with Bill Gates, one of the leading enthusiasts of MicroUnity is John
Malone, who for the last year has been celebrating its potential to create
a &quot;Cray on a tray&quot; for his set-top boxes and cable modems. For
the rest of this decade, most Americans will be able to connect to broadband
networks only over cable coax. Thus the link of TCI to MicroUnity and to
Tiger offers the best promise of an information infrastructure over the
next five years, affording a potential increase in bandwidth of 250,000-fold
over the current four-kilohertz telephone wires.<BR>
<BR>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies and the cable companies agree that
cable coax is the optimal broadband conduit to homes and that fiber optics
is the best technology for connecting central switches or headends to neighborhoods.
Looping through communities, with a short drop at each home--rather than
running a separate wire from the central office to every household--hybrid
fiber-coax networks, according to a Pacific Bell study can reduce the cost
of setup and maintenance of connections by some 75% and cut back the need
for wire by a factor of 600.<BR>
<BR>
In order to bring broadband video to homes, companies must collaborate with
the cable TV industry. Collaborating with TCI, Microsoft once again has
chosen the correct technology to leverage. With Digital Equipment, Zenith
and Intel all engaged in alliances for the creation of cable modems--and
several other companies announcing cable modem projects--Gates may well
be leading the pack in transforming his company from a computer company
into a communications concern, from the microcosm into the telecosm.<BR>

<BR>
All the bandwidth in the world, however, will get you nowhere if your transceiver
cannot process it. By returning to the inspiration of the original Silicon
Valley, MicroUnity offers a promising route to the communications infrastructure
of the next century, overthrowing Moore's Law and issuing the first fundamental
challenge to Moore's company. As Al Matthews puts it: &quot;Bob Noyce [the
late Intel founder with Gordon Moore] is my hero. But there is a new generation
at hand in Silicon Valley today, and this generation is doing things that
Bob Noyce never dreamed of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Moussouris promises to deliver 10,000 mediaprocessors for set-top boxes
in 1995. As everyone agrees, this is a high-risk project (although Bill
Gates favorably compares MicroUnity's risk to his other gamble, Teledesic).
Even if it takes years for MicroUnity to reach its telecosmic millennium,
the advance of communications processors continues to accelerate. Already
available today, for example, is Texas Instruments' MVP system--the first
full-fledged mediaprocessor on one chip. It will function at a mere 30 to
50 megahertz but performs between two and three billion signal processing
steps per second or roughly between 1,000 and 1,500 DSP mips. Rather than
revving up the clock to gigahertz frenzies, TI gained its performance through
a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data approach associated with the massively
parallel supercomputer industry. The MVP combines four 64-bit digital signal
processors with a 32-bit RISC CPU, a floating point unit, two video controllers,
64 kilobytes of static RAM cache and a 64-bit direct memory access controller--all
on one sliver of silicon, costing some $ 232 per thousand mips in 1995,
when Pentiums will give you a hundred mips for perhaps twice as much.<BR>
<BR>
This does not favor the notion that microprocessors will soon &quot;suck
in&quot; DSPs. DSP mips and computer mips are different animals. As DSP
guru Will Strauss points out, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a microprocessor
mips rating must be divided by about five to get a DSP mips rating.&quot;
To equal an MVP for DSP operations, a microprocessor would have to achieve
some 5,000 mips.<BR>
<BR>
Designed with the aid of teleconferencing company VTEL and Sony, the MVP
chip can simultaneously encode or decode video using any favored compression
scheme, process audio, faxes or input from a scanner and perform speech
recognition or other pattern-matching algorithms. While Intel and Hewlett-Packard
have been winning most of the headlines for their new RISC processing alliance,
the key development in the microprocessor domain is the emergence of this
new class of one-chip multimedia communications systems.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. Over the next decade, computer speeds will rise about
a hundredfold, while bandwidth increases a thousandfold or more. Under these
circumstances, the winners will be the companies that learn to use bandwidth
as a substitute for computer processing and switching. The winners will
be the companies that most truly embrace the Sun slogan: &quot;The network
is the computer.&quot; As Schmidt predicts, over the next few years &quot;the
value-added of the network will so exceed the value-added of the CPU that
your future computer will be rated not in mips but in gigabits per second.
Bragging rights will go not to the person with the fastest CPU but to the
person with the fastest network--and associated database lookup, browsing
and information retrieval engines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm will eclipse the law of the microcosm as the driving
force of progress. Springing from the exponential improvement in the power
delay product as transistors are made smaller, the law of the microcosm
holds that if you take any number (N) transistors and put them on a single
sliver of silicon you will get N squared performance and value. Conceived
by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, the law of the telecosm holds
that if you take any number (n) computers and link them in networks, you
get n squared performance and value. Thus the telecosm builds on and compounds
the microcosmic law. The power of Tiger, MicroUnity and TCI comes from fusing
the two laws into a gathering tide of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
With network technology advancing 10 times as fast as central processors,
the network and its nodes will become increasingly central while CPUs become
increasingly peripheral. Faced with a CPU bottleneck, multimedia systems
will simply bypass the CPU on broadband pipes. Circumventing Amdahl's Law,
system designers will adapt their architectures to exploit the high bandwidth
components, such as mediaprocessors, ATM switches and fiber links. In time
the microprocessor will become a vestigial link to the legacy systems such
as word processing and spreadsheets that once defined the machine. All of
this means that while the last two decades have been the epoch of the computer
industry, the next two decades will belong to the suppliers of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The chief beneficiaries of all this invention, however, will be the people
of the world, ascending to new pinnacles of prosperity in an Information
Age. Although many observers fear that these new tools will chiefly aid
the existing rich--or the educated and smart--these technologies have already
brought prosperity to a billion Asians, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia
and China, previously mired in penury.<BR>
<BR>
Communications bandwidth is not only the secret of electronic progress.
It is also the heart of economic growth, stretching the webs of interconnection
that extend the reach of markets and the realms of opportunity. Lavishing
the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly productive
tools and unleashing creativity with increasingly fertile and targeted capital,
the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope to the masses of people
whom the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>

&quot;They'll Be Crowding The Skies.&quot;
</B></PRE>
THUS STEVEN DORFMAN, president of telecommunications and space operations
for GM Hughes_the colossus of the satellite industry_warned the world of
a new peril in the skies. Planning to launch 840 satellites in low earth
orbits, at an altitude of some 435 miles, were a gang of cellular phone
jocks and computer hackers from Seattle going under the name of Teledesic.
Led by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, they were barging onto his turf and threatening
to ruin the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
You get the image of the heavens darkening and a new Ice Age looming as
more and more of this low-orbit junk_including a total of some 1,200 satellites
from Motorola's Iridium, Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar and Teledesic, among
other LEO projects_accumulates in the skies. Ultimately, from this point
of view, you might imagine the clutter of LEOs eclipsing the geostationary
orbit itself, the so-called Clarke belt, some 21,000 miles farther out.
Named after science-fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke, the geostationary orbit
is the girdle and firmament of the Hughes empire.<BR>
<BR>
In an article in Wireless magazine in 1945, Clarke first predicted that
satellites in orbit 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers) above the equator,
where the period of revolution is 24 hours, could maintain a constant elevation
and angle from any point on Earth. In such a fixed orbit, a device could
remain for decades, receiving signals from a transmitter on the earth and
radiating them back across continents.<BR>
<BR>
The Clarke orbit also posed a problem, however_the reverse square law for
signal power. Signals in space attenuate in proportion to the square of
the distance they travel. This means that communications with satellites
22,000 miles away typically require large antenna dishes (as much as 10
meters wide) or megawatts of focused beam power.<BR>
<BR>
Now, however, a new satellite industry is emerging, based on gains in computer
and microchip technology. These advances allow the use of compact handsets
with small smart antennas that can track low earth orbit satellites sweeping
across the skies at a speed of 25,000 kilometers an hour at a variety of
altitudes between 500 and 1,400 kilometers above the earth. Roughly 60 times
nearer than geostationary satellites, LEOs find the inverse square law working
in their favor, allowing them to offer far more capacity, cheaper and smaller
antennas, or some combination of both. Breaking out of the Clarke orbit,
these systems vastly expand the total available room for space-based communications
gear.<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed possible to &quot;crowd&quot; the Clarke belt_a relatively
narrow swath at a single altitude directly above the equator. But even this
swath does not become physically congested; collisions are no problem. The
Clarke belt becomes crowded because the ability of antennas on the ground
to discriminate among satellites is limited by the size of the antenna.
Spaceway and Teledesic both plan to use the Ka band of frequencies, between
17 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second. In this
band, reasonably sized antennas 66 centimeters wide can distinguish between
geostationary satellites two degrees apart. That's some 800 miles in the
Clarke belt. Thus no physical crowding. But it means that there are only
a total of 180 Clarke slots for Ka band devices, including undesirable space
over oceans.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs, however, can be launched anywhere between the earth's atmosphere and
a layer of intense radiation called the Van Allen Belt. The very concept
of crowding becomes absurd in this 900 kilometer span of elevations for
moving orbits that can be 500 meters apart or less. Thus the 21 proposed
orbital planes of Teledesic occupy a total of 10 kilometers of altitude.
At this rate, 70 or more Teledesic systems, comprising some 65,000 satellites,
could comfortably fit in low earth orbits.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, it was clear that the LEOs, one way or another, were crowding
Hughes. Hughes commands satellite systems or projects that compete with
every one of the LEOs. Hughes responded to the threat of Teledesic by announcing
the expansion of its Spaceway satellite system, then planned for North America
alone, to cover the entire globe. Then, invoking the absolute priority currently
granted geostationary systems, Hughes asked the Federal Communications Commission
to block Teledesic entirely by assigning Spaceway the full five gigahertz
of spectrum internationally available in the Ka band.<BR>
<BR>
On May 27, Dorfman summoned the upstarts, Craig McCaw and Teledesic President
Russell Daggatt, to Hughes headquarters in Los Angeles for a talk. Busy
with Microsoft_the Redmond, Wash., company that in 1993 temporarily surpassed
the market value of General Motors_Teledesic partner Bill Gates did not
make the trip. But as the epitome of the personal computer industry, his
presence haunted the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Together with Spaceway chief Kevin McGrath, Dorfman set out to convince
the Seattle venturers to give up their foolhardy scheme and instead join
with Hughes in the nine satellites of Spaceway. Not only could Spaceway's
nine satellites cover the entire globe with the same services that Teledesic's
840 satellites would provide, Spaceway could be expanded incrementally as
demand emerged. Just loft another Hughes satellite. Indeed, Spaceway's ultimate
system envisaged 17 satellites. With &quot;every component proprietary to
Hughes,&quot; as Dorfman said, the satellites only cost some $ 150 million
apiece. By contrast, most of the $ 9 billion Teledesic system would have
to be launched before global services could begin.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the new LEOs marked as decisive a break in the history of space-based
communications as the PC represented in the history of computing. Moreover,
Teledesic would be the only LEO fully focused on serving computers_the first
truly &quot;global Internet,&quot; as McCaw's vice president Tom Alberg
depicted it. It brings space communications at last into the age of ubiquitous
microchip intelligence, and it brings the law of the microcosm into space
communications.<BR>
<BR>
If you enjoyed the New World of Wireless on the ground with its fierce battles
between communications standards, technical geniuses, giant companies, impetuous
entrepreneurs and industrial politicians on three continents_you will relish
the reprise hundreds and even thousands of miles up. Launching Teledesic,
McCaw and Gates were extending bandwidth abundance from earth into space.
Observers, however, often did not like what they heard.

Bad Press For Two Billionaires
</B></PRE>
Every so often, the media is taken by the notion of technology as a morality
tale. In place of a gripping saga of unjustly obscure geniuses enriching
the world by their heroic creativity in the teeth of uncomprehending bureaucrats
and politicians, the media treat technology ventures as a school for scandal.
We have mock exposes of computer hype, monopoly, vaporware, viruses, infoscams,
netporn, securities &quot;fraud&quot; and deviously undocumented software
calls. Pundits gabble endlessly about the gap yawning between the information
rich and the information poor, thus consigning themselves undeniably, amid
many yawns, to the latter category. While American market share climbs near
70% in computers, networks, software and leading-edge semiconductors, analysts
furrow the brows of the Atlantic Monthly with tales of farseeing foreign
teams, spearheaded by visionary government officials, capturing the markets
of American cowboy capitalists. They spiel implausible yams of tough-minded
trade warriors prying open the jaws of Japan for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us,
closing down vicious Korean vendors of low-priced dynamic RAMs, or blasting
through barriers to U.S. telecom gear in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, saving
the day for Motorola's soon-to-be cobwebbed factories for analog cellular
phones.<BR>
<BR>
One of these sagas began early this year with two Seattle billionaires,
McCaw and Gates, allegedly boarding McCaw's sleek yacht and going on an
ego trip. With McCaw pitching in an early nickel, and the boat, and Gates
hoisting his name as a sail, the two tycoons seemed to sweep away from the
shores of rationality, as the media told it, into a sea of microwaves and
arsenic. Spinning out Teledesic to build an information superhighway in
the sky, they proposed to strew the heavens with 840 satellites, plus 84
spares. All would whirl around the world at a height of 700 kilometers (435
miles), using what they told the FCC would be some 500 million gallium arsenide
microchips to issue frequencies between 20 and 60 gigahertz from some 180,000
phased-array antennas. The entire project seemed suffused with gigahertz
and gigabucks. &quot;We're bandwidth bulls,&quot; says Teledesic President
Daggatt.<BR>
<BR>
In case the hype of the sponsors failed to keep the system radiant and aloft,
fueling it also would be a total of 12,000 batteries fed by thin film solar
collectors stretching out behind the satellite &quot;birds&quot; in some
130 square kilometers of gossamer wings. Working at 4% efficiency, these
cells would collectively generate 10 megawatts of power, enough to light
a small city, but, so the critics said, insufficient to reach Seattle at
microwave frequencies in the rain. (The Teledesic frequencies are readily
absorbed by water in the air). To manage the elaborate mesh of fast-packet
communications among the satellites and ground terminals, the constellation
would bear some 282,000 Mips, or millions of instructions per second, of
radiation-hard microprocessors and a trillion bytes or so of rad-hard RAM.
In effect, Teledesic would be launching into space one of the world's largest
and most expensive massively parallel computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
At a mere $ 9 billion, to be put up by interested investors, Teledesic's
lawyers told the FCC, the price would be a bargain for the U.S. and the
world. (By contrast, current plans call for $ 15 billion just to lay fiber
for interactive TV in California). But former Motorola, now Kodak, chief
George Fisher fresh from pondering numbers for the apparently similar Iridium
projects_suggested that $ 40 billion for Teledesic would be more like it.
(Teledesic had the improbable result of making Iridium's 66-satellite plan,
greeted in 1990 with much of the scorn now lavished on Teledesic, seem modest).
Just rocketing the 840 satellites into orbit was said to entail a successful
launch every week for a year and a half at a time when hoisting satellites
is still a precarious and sometime thing.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Teledesic succeeded in getting the things up, so other scientists
suggested, the satellites would then be impaled on some 7,000 pieces of
space debris in the chosen orbits. In any case, so it was widely reported,
10% would fail every year, some tumbling out of orbit, others joining the
whirl of litter, where they would fly ready to impale the remainder of the
satellites and the remnants of the two billionaires' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Surely these sages know that by the year 2001, when the systems would be
up and running, the world will be swimming in the bandwidth of &quot;information
superhighways.&quot; Why support this lavish launch of technology for a
communications system that would be dwarfed by capabilities already demonstrated
on the ground?<BR>
<BR>
Summing up a near-consensus of critics, John Pike, director of the Federation
of American Scientists' Space Policy Project, declared to the Wall Street
Journal, &quot;God save us. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of!&quot;
Provoking Pike may have been the origins of the multisatellite architecture
in the Star Wars &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; program. Teledesic's most
amazing achievement to date has been to displace the Strategic Defense Initiative
as Pike's peak example of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
While McCaw and Gates could be dismissed as tyros in the satellite field,
Hughes is world champion. Since 1963, the company has put 107 communications
satellites into orbit. With 19 in 1994, this year should be its biggest
ever. In 1993, well before the Teledesic announcement, Dorfman announced
the first version of Spaceway_a $ 660 million, two-satellite system offering
voice, data and video services_as a contribution to &quot;information superhighways.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of all the terrestrial uproar surrounding superhighwaymen Al
Gore, John Malone of TCI, Raymond Smith of Bell Atlantic and scores of other
telco and cable magnates, however, no one paid much attention to Hughes.<BR>
<BR>
Then came Gates and McCaw with Teledesic and claims of 20 million potential
subscribers, two million simultaneous connections, billion-bit-per-second
&quot;gigalinks,&quot; bandwidth on demand and an array of other features,
all advertised at a cost for Spaceway-type services nearly three times lower
per bit per second. Everyone noticed Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of July, though, Hughes raised the stakes. With successful launches
under way in China, Brazil and French Guiana to provide exclamation points,
Hughes made a new submission to the FCC, extending Spaceway into a nine-satellite
global system costing $ 3.2 billion. McGrath plausibly claimed it could
be in place long before Teledesic and offer nearly all its functionality
at a third of the price.<BR>
<BR>
Already planned to be in place by 1998, however, were several other LEO
projects, led by Motorola's Iridium and Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar. As
mobile phone projects, these systems could not readily offer service at
T-1 data rates. But their sponsors promised availability for simple E-mail,
faxes and paging.<BR>
<BR>
By mid-1994, Motorola seemed to command the financial momentum. The company
succeeded in raising some $ 800 million in equity investments from companies
around the globe, including Lockheed and Raytheon (which would build the
satellites), Great Wall of China and Khrunichev Enterprises of Russia (which
together would launch a third of them), the Mawarid Group of Saudi Arabia
(which pitched in $ 120 million) and Kyocera, Mitsui and DDI, which together
put up another $ 120 million (Kyocera will build the dual mode handsets
for Japan and DDI will sell and service them). On August 10, an Indian consortium
purchased a 5% stake and a seat on the board for $ 38 million. Motorola
claimed its share of the equity was dropping to 28.5%, well on the way to
the company's final target of 15%. Motorola estimates that much of the additional
$ 2 billion in the plan could come from debt securities and loans.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's attractions are impressive. It provides ubiquitous global phone
service at a premium price with little or no dependence on local terrestrial
facilities. In times of disaster or political crisis, or in places with
sparse or unreliable local service, the system can route calls among the
66 satellites in space bypassing all infrastructure on the ground. For an
elite of government officials and corporate figures operating in remote
areas, the availability of Iridium should be worth the money. A bold and
visionary concept when it emerged in 1987 from a team in the company's satellite
systems engineering group, it endows many regions of the earth with voice
and limited data communications for the first time. For example, it actually
focuses on polar domains, such as parts of Siberia, poorly served by other
satellite systems. Kazuo Inamori, the venerable chairman of Kyocera, also
believes that Iridium will be popular in the 60% of territorial Japan not
currently covered by cellular. 
<PRE>
<B>

&quot;Give Us Spectrum, Let Others Fight&quot;

</B></PRE>
None-the-less, beyond the bold and ingenious concept (Daggatt calls Iridium
&quot;the real pioneer of LEOs&quot;), the system suffers from technical
flaws. Were it not for Globalstar, perhaps these flaws would not have become
evident until alter the 66 birds were aloft. A far simpler and cheaper solution,
Globalstar uses 48 satellites with no links between them. Each functions
as a &quot;bent pipe&quot; transponder, receiving signals from a phone on
the ground and passing them back to any gateway within the satellite's 1,500-mile-wide
footprint, linked to locally available telephone networks. Because Globalstar
uses local phone systems rather than bypassing them, the system has been
able to raise a total of some $ 300 million in support from Alcatel, France
Telecom, Vodafone (serving the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong),
Airtouch-U S West, Hyundai and DACOM in Korea, Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia.<BR>
<BR>
This amount may seem small beside the billion raised by Iridium. But Globalstar
has capital costs (at $ 1.8 billion) one-half Iridium's, circuit costs one-third
Iridium's, and terminal costs (at $ 750 each) one-fourth Iridium's. With
no intelligence in space, Globalstar relies entirely on the advance of intelligent
phones and portable computer devices on the ground; it is the Ethernet of
satellite architectures. Costing one-half as much as Iridium, it will handle
nearly 20 times more calls.<BR>
<BR>
The advantages of Globalstar stem only partly from its avoidance of complex
intersatellite connections and use of infrastructure already in place on
the ground. More important is its avoidance of exclusive spectrum assignments.
Originating several years before spread-spectrum technology was thoroughly
tested for cellular phones, Iridium employs time division multiple access,
an obsolescent system that requires exclusive command of spectrum but offers
far less capacity than code division multiple access.<BR>
<BR>
Like conventional cellular or radio transmissions that differentiate signals
by time slot or frequency, TDMA sharply restricts the reuse of spectrum
in nearby cells. By contrast, CDMA is a form of spread-spectrum communications
that differentiates signals by a spreading code and allows the use of the
same frequencies all the time, everywhere. Just as you can reduplicate wireline
spectrum merely by laying another fiber, you can now manufacture new spectrum
in the air merely by breaking large cells into smaller ones.<BR>
<BR>
Among some six companies seeking low earth orbit satellite approval from
the FCC in 1993, only Iridium used TDMA, requiring national and international
bodies to pick it as a winner from the outset and assign it exclusive spectrum.
By contrast, in a majority report issued to the FCC on April 6, 1993, CDMA
companies in the U.S., including TRW, Loral-Qualcomm, Celsat and American
Mobile Satellite, could all agree to share spectrum and let the market choose
winners. A Motorola lawyer explained to Space News, &quot;Give us the spectrum
and let the others fight for whatever's left.&quot; In the face of alternatives
with no need for exclusive spectrum allocations, Iridium could fly only
if it offered radically superior performance or capacity. But TDMA dooms
it to generally inferior performance and capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TDMA systems, which can &quot;see&quot; only one satellite signal
at a time, CDMA handsets have &quot;path&quot; diversity, using &quot;rake
receivers&quot; that can combine a number of weak signals into an intelligible
stream. Iridium and other TDMA systems compensate by using more power. But
no practical amount of power can propel a satellite signal through a tin
roof. And excess power means larger handsets or heavier satellites. Iridium
satellites together use 80% more power than Globalstar's, yet employ antennas
nearly twice as large and offer 18.2 times less capacity per unit area.
<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic also suffers from the use of TDMA. But Teledesic's T-1 capabilities
would compensate with 100,000 times more bandwidth and with a bit error
rate that can accommodate the new fiber standards such as SONET-ATM (synchronous
optical network/asynchronous transfer mode), which send packets without
retransmission. The issue is whether these features can justify the political,
financial, and performance costs of using a modulation scheme_TDMA_that
severely limits spectrum sharing and path diversity.<BR>
<BR>
So what is this, another saga of hubris on the information super-highway_to
go with the Raymond Smith-John Malone follies? Perhaps good new ideas are
harder to come by as company revenues grow into the billions, and Gates
and McCaw disinvest and diversify as fast as they can from their increasingly
cumbrous vessels of wealth. Having recently passed the billion-dollar mark
in his systematic process of disinvestment from Microsoft_he retains $ 8
billion or so_Gates at times seemed embarrassed by his link to this gigantic
project. He told us it was too early to write about Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
No, the story is in fact more interesting. Impelled by the onrushing rise
in the cost-effectiveness of individual chips compared to multichip systems,
the Law of the Microcosm dictates decentralization of all information architectures.
During the 1980s, this centrifuge struck the mainframe computer establishment
of IBM. During the 1990s, the personal teleputer, summoning and shaping
films and files of images from around the world, will collide with the centralized
establishments of TV broadcasting. At the end of the century, Teledesic
and the other LEOs will usher in the age of decentralization in space.<BR>
<BR>
From this point of view, Gates' participation becomes more readily intelligible.
Gates seems always to follow the microcosm wherever it leads. A vision of
software for decentralized systems of personal computers informs everything
Microsoft does. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, for example, Microsoft made an investment in Metricom, a wireless
terrestrial system that supplies links of up to 56 kilobits per second to
portable computers or personal digital assistants. Within cells, the devices
can communicate directly with one another; outside the cell, Metricom routes
its calls through an expandable mesh of nodes each the size of a shoebox
and costing less than $ 1,000. Based on spread-spectrum technology, the
system operates at power levels low enough to avoid the need for FCC licenses.
Yet it can be expanded to metropolitan-area dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
In many respects, Teledesic is Metricom in the sky. It is focused on computer
communications. It routes packets by the most convenient path through a
mesh of nodes. It is based on microprocessor technology. (Both Teledesic
and Metricom plan to employ devices from Motorola's 68000 family). As Gates
explains the system: &quot;Some functions are most efficiently performed
by large numbers of small processors working together, rather than a few
large ones.&quot; The entire new generation of low earth orbit satellite
systems relies on this centrifugal force of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
It was not supposed to happen this way. Just as Grosch's Law of the computer
industry implied that computer power rose by the square of the cost, there
was a similar law of the satellite industry that held satellite efficiency
to be proportional to see. In a popular text, &quot;Communications Satellite
Systems,&quot; published in 1978, James Martin cited an AT&T study showing
that just six satellites could carry all the long-distance traffic from
the American continent; no fiber optics would be necessary. &quot;The next
major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of
scale which today's technology offers,&quot; wrote Martin, urging creation
of &quot;massive hardware&quot; as heavy as several tons and &quot;immensely
powerful satellites with large antennas beaming as much information as we
are capable of using to our rooftops.&quot; Many satellite advocates, led
by Arthur C. Clarke, viewed with impatient scorn the expensive terrestrial
systems that somehow forestalled the manifest destiny of big birds to rule
the world of communications. 
<PRE>
<B>

Bringing The Microcosm To Space
</B></PRE>
In 1994, the big bird dream still flourishes in Spaceway, the international
consortium Inmarsat, and the new launch this summer of direct broadcast
satellite technology by Hughes's DirecTV, Hubbard's USSB, TCI's Primestar,
and Rupert Murdoch's imperial systems in Europe and Asia. Using centralized
satellites in geosynchronous orbits, DBS is the ultimate broadcast medium,
reaching billions of potential customers at the cost of reaching hundreds
of thousands through cable-TV systems. But these geostationary satellite
systems suffer from the same flaws as mainframes: sclerosis by centralization.
At a time when customers want the choice, control, convenience and interactivity
of computers, the big birds offer one-size-fits-all programming at specified
times, with little ability to control the flow or interact with it.<BR>
<BR>
The real showstopper in the long run, though, is a nagging half-second time
delay for Clarke orbit signals. Bad enough for voice, a half-second is near
eternity for computer communications; for the living-room and desktop supercomputers
of 2001, a half-second delay would mean gigabytes of information to be stored
in buffers. While companies across the country, from Intel to Digital Equipment,
are rushing to market with cable modems to allow computer connections to
CATV coax, geosatellites remain mostly computer-hostile. Even with the new
digital cosmetics of DBS, geosynchronous satellites are a last vestige of
centralization in a centrifugal world.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Teledesic brings the microcosm to space. Rather than gaming
economies of scale from using a few huge satellites, Teledesic gains economies
of scale by launching as many small birds as possible. Based on Peter Huber's
concept of a geodesic network_a mesh of peers equally spaced apart like
the nodes in a geodesic dome_Teledesic is not a hierarchy but a heterarchy.
Distributing the system responsibilities among 840 autonomous satellites
diminishes the requirements, such as message throughput and power usage,
for each one. Building redundancy into the entire constellation, rather
than within each satellite, yields higher overall reliability, while reducing
the complexity and price of each unit.<BR>
<BR>
As Craig McCaw explains, &quot;At a certain point, redundant systems create
more complexity and weight than they are worth. Rather than having each
satellite a 747 in the sky with triply redundant systems, we have hundreds
of satellites that offer self-redundancy.&quot; Eschewing the Hughes philosophy
of &quot;every component proprietary to Hughes,&quot; Teledesic will manufacture
and launch a large number of satellite peers, using off-the-shelf parts
whenever possible. This approach also provides economies of scale that,
according to a study by brilliant pebbles contractor Martin Marietta, could
lower unit costs by a factor of one hundred or more.<BR>
<BR>
Just as microcosmic technology uses infinitesimal low-powered transistors
and puts them so close together that they work faster than large high-powered
transistors, Teledesic satellites follow the rules of low and slow. Rather
than one big powerful bird spraying signals across continents, Teledesic
offers 840, programmably targetable at small localities. Just 435 miles
out, the delay is measured in milliseconds rather than half-seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The total computing power and wattage of the constellation seems large,
as is needed to sustain a volume of some two million connections at a time,
four times Spaceway's capacity. But with other link features equal, between
1,226 and 3,545 times more power is needed to communicate with a geostationary
satellite than with a LEO.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, unlike Iridium, TRW's Odyssey, and Globalstar, Teledesic
from the outset has targeted the fastest- growing market of the future:
communications for the world's 125 million PCs, now growing some 20% a year.
And Teledesic has correctly chosen the technology needed to extend computer
networks globally_broadband low earth orbit satellites. The real issue is
not the future of Teledesic but the future of Iridium.<BR>
<BR>
In the short run Iridium's voice services cannot compete with Globalstar's
cheaper and more robust CDMA system. But in the long run Iridium could be
trumped by Teledesic. Although Teledesic has no such plans, the incremental
cost of incorporating an &quot;L&quot; band transceiver in Teledesic, to
perform the Iridium functions for voice, would be just 10% of Teledesic's
total outlays, or less than $ 1 billion (compared with the $3.4 billion
initial capital costs of Iridium). But 840 linked satellites could offer
far more cost-effective service than Iridium's 66.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's dilemma is that the complexities and costs of its ingenious mesh
of intersatellite links and switches can be justified only by offering broadband
computer services. Yet Iridium is a doggedly narrowband system focused on
voice.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium eventually will have to adopt Teledesic's broadband logic and architecture.
To protect its global lead in wireless communications and equipment, Motorola
should join with Teledesic now, rather than later. Working with Lockheed,
Motorola is making impressive gains in satellite-manufacturing technology.
Supplying both handsets and space gear for computer networks, Motorola could
turn its huge investment of time, money and prestige in Iridium into a dramatic
global coup in wireless computer services. As part of a broadband system,
Iridium could still become a superb brand name for Motorola. But persisting
in a narrowband strategy in the name of avoiding Teledesic's larger initial
costs, Motorola's executives will end up inflicting serious strategic costs
on the company.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the famous objections to Teledesic are based on ignorance or misinformation.
Launch anxieties spring chiefly from the GEO experience. LEOs are 60 times
nearer and between a tenth and a third the weight. Teledesic satellites
are designed to be hoisted in groups of eight or more. From Great Wall in
China to Khrunichev in Russia, companies around the world will soon be competing
to supply low-cost launching facilities for the system. Orbital Sciences,
an entrepreneurial dervish near Washington's Dulles Airport with some $
190 million in revenues, has developed a low-cost method for lofting groups
of LEOs from an adapted Lockheed 1011 Tristar.<BR>
<BR>
Other fears are similarly fallacious. Teledesic will work fine in the rain
because the high minimum vertical angle (40 degrees) of its satellite links
from the ground reduces the portion of the path exposed to water to a manageable
level. By contrast, geostationary satellites must operate at eight degrees,
passing the signal through a long span of atmosphere. Made of tough new
composite materials, Teledesic satellites will endure the kind of debris
found in space mostly unscathed. The solar arrays can accept holes without
significantly damaging overall performance. All in all, Teledesic's designers
expect the birds to remain in orbit for an average of ten years. With most
of its key technologies plummeting in price along with the rest of electronic
components, the system may well cost even less and perform better than its
business plan promises or George Fisher speculates.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, widely charged with reckless technological presumption, the designers
of Teledesic in fact seem recklessly cautious in their assumptions about
the rate of microchip progress. For example, their dismissal of CDMA assumes
that the high speed of the spreading code functions_requiring digital signal
processors that race at least 100 times the data rate_pushes cheap T-1 performance
far into the future. Yet in early 1995, Texas Instruments will ship its
multimedia video processor, a marvel that combines four 64-bit DSPs, a 32-bit
RISC CPU, 50 kilobytes of on-chip memory, a floating-point unit and a 64bit
direct memory access controller all on one chip. This device now performs
two billion operations per second and, with an upgrade from 35 megahertz
to 50 megahertz clock rate, soon will perform three billion. The estimated
cost in 1995 is around $ 400, or a stunning $ 133 per bop (current Pentiums
charge three times as much for 100 mips). Five years from now, when Teledesic
gets serious, that kind of one-chip computing power can implement CDMA for
broadband data without any cost penalty. Future generations of CDMA systems
may be able to offer, at a dramatically lower price, the same broadband
services in mobile applications that Teledesic now promises for fixed services
only.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that Teledesic meets the CDMA challenge, the other fear is that
terrestrial systems will capture enough of the market to render Teledesic
unprofitable. This fear, however, can come true only if governments delay
this supremely beneficial system well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the competition, satellite systems can provide global coverage at
once. Whether for $ 9 billion or $ 90 billion, no terrestrial system will
cover the entire world, or even the entire U.S., within decades of Teledesic.
As soon as it is deployed, it will profoundly change the geography and topography
of the globe. Suddenly the most remote rural redoubt, beach, or mountain
will command computer communications comparable to urban corporations today.
The system can make teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine, and teleschooling
possible anywhere. Gone will be the differences among regions in access
to cultural and information resources. People will be able to live and work
where they want rather than where corporations locate them.<BR>
<BR>
This change transforms the dimensions of the world as decisively as trains,
planes, automobiles, phones and TVs changed them in previous eras. It will
extend &quot;universal service&quot; more dramatically than any new law
can.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Teledesic can eliminate the need to cross-subsidize rural customers.
Determining the cost of wire-line services are the parameters of population
density and distance from the central office. Rural customers now cost between
10 and 30 times as much to serve with wires as urban customers do. Teledesic
will bring near-broadband capabilities to everyone in the world at the same
price.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, this expansion of the communications frontier will foster
the very economic development that will fuel the demand for the service.
Today, it does not pay to bring telecommunications to poor countries that
might benefit most. Teledesic and other satellite services break the bottleneck
of development. Simultaneously opening the entire world, it enriches every
nation with new capital exceeding the fruits of all the foreign aid programs
of the era.<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic is a venture worthy of McCaw and Gates. In its impact on the world,
it may even rival the Herculean contributions of its sponsors in cellular
and software. The issue is not the technology or the commitment of the principals.
The issue is the readiness of the U.S. government to accommodate this venture.
Before Teledesic can be approved internationally, it will have to attain
a license from the FCC in the U.S. It has taken four years to approve Iridium.
It took 30 years to approve cellular. How long will it take to approve Teledesic?<BR>
<BR>
Currently Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar face several political obstacles.
The International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulation 2613 gives
GEOs absolute priority over LEOs. For Spaceway, Hughes is now demanding
an exclusive license for the full five gigahertz available in the Ka-band
worldwide, leaving no room for Teledesic or any other Ka-band LEO. Under
current law, Hughes or other GEO systems could usurp any LEO that was launched.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs are a major American innovation. The U.S. government should take the
lead now in spearheading a change in the regulations to accommodate LEOs.
This is no minor matter. As the dimensions and promise of Teledesic loom
more starkly, the Japanese or Europeans are certain to make similar proposals.
&quot;When they do,&quot; Craig McCaw predicts, &quot;they will immediately
have their government on board. They will be able to go to the ITU right
away. My greatest fear is that we will have the technology all ready, and
foreign companies will beat us out because they can get their governments
in line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government was on board for Apollo 25 years ago and the U.S. won
the first space race. This space race is just as important, but the government
is treating it as some sleepy-time infrastructure project. In fact, it is
the information superhighway going global and ubiquitous. It is the ultimate
promise of the information age, says McCaw. 
<PRE>
<B>

Sustaining The U.S. Lead In Technology
</B></PRE>
McCaw explains: &quot;It'll mean ecological disaster if China mimics what
we did_building more and more urban towers and filling them up with people
who queue up every day on turnpikes into the city, emitting fumes into the
air, and then building new towers and new highways when you want to move
the company, and then digging up the highways to install new wires.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McCaw waves toward the window, out at Lake Washington. &quot;Look at that
floating bridge. It took $ 1.5 billion to cross Lake Washington, then it
got busted in a storm. Cross this lake, any lake, any ocean in the world
with broadband wireless. That's the promise of Teledesic. All you do is
to reconfigure the communications in software at zero incremental cost.
No wires for the final connections. It's what we do in Hong Kong and Shanghai,
where everyone uses a cellular phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Vice President Gore and other members of the administration
continually ask what they can do for technology. One thing they can do is
vastly streamline the process for approval of communications projects. At
the moment, Congress is determined to retain bureaucratic dominance over
the most dynamic enterprise and technology in the world economy_what they
like to term the information superhighway. They see it as a possible source
of congressional power, campaign finance, employment and pelf, like the
Baby Bells today or like existing construction projects. Rather than turn
telecom into a vast porkbellied poverty program, however, the administration
should deregulate the field. Communications companies must be permitted
to compete and collaborate wherever the technology leads.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the administration knows it or not, these technologies are its greatest
political asset. The high-tech industries unleashed in the 1980s by venture
capital and junk bonds are now the prime fuel of the economy of the 1990s.
Comprising perhaps 60% of incremental GDP and 48% of exports, the momentous
upsurge of computers and communications is even compensating for the mistakes
of the Bush and Clinton regimes and making plausible Clinton's continuing
claims of economic success. But now Clinton, Gore and FCC Chairman Reed
Hundt must make a choice. If they want to maintain this redemptive U.S.
lead in technology, they must be willing to forge new alliances in Congress
to get the politicians and bureaucrats out of the way of the future. A good
start would be to open the floodgates for the global onrush of low earth
orbit satellites dedicated to computer communications. If they do, they
can help make the world, as McCaw's Alberg puts it, &quot;a truly global
Internet in an ever-expanding ethersphere.&quot; 
<PRE>
<B>
And The Winner Is...
</B></PRE>
Globalstar is the easy winner for current offering of mobile phone services
under a CDMA regime of spectrum sharing. But Teledesic can add phone services
to its broadband computer system. Over time, Teledesic's 840 satellites
will outperform Globalstar's 48. Big question: When will microchip technology
advance enough to allow broadband applications over CDMA? When that happens,
Globalstar has a shot at the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium is both too expensive to compete in mobile phones and too narrowband
for data. Today's champ Spaceway is maturing. Big winner for the next decade
is... Teledesic.

<HR><BR>
Big Government and Mass Media always feed on fear of monsters. While politicians
promise to protect the people from the dreaded private sector, leading newspapers
such as the Washington Post and network shows such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
chime in with continuing reports on the economy as seen from the shores
of Loch Ness. Peering through the shifting, inscrutable murk of the marketplace,
pundits both private and public can descry beneath every ripple of industrial
change the spectral shape of some circling shark or serpent from which only
a new bureaucracy or liberal constabulary can save us.<BR>
<BR>
There are always many witnesses to the threat. In his campaigns of creative
destruction, any great capitalist provokes enough panic in the establishment
to fuel the beadles who would bring him down. Losing competitors, whether
in oil or software, are always in the vanguard of the monster hunt, which
is therefore usually launched in the name of &quot;competition&quot; and
is designed to stop it in its tracks before anyone wins.<BR>
<BR>
In the industrial era it was the so-called Robber Barons--creators of the
great industries of oil, steel and finance--who greased the growth of government
with their chimerical menace. Radically reducing the prices of their products,
such leaders as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan expanded the economy to
serve middle- and lower-income customers and laid the foundation for the
American industrial leadership that triumphed in two world wars. But at
the same time, charged with predatory pricing, collusive marketing dumping
and other competitive violations, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan emerged
as the monsters of monopoly who fueled the growth of government through
the first 40 years of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Now, with information technology driving private sector wealth and power,
there is a need for new monsters to fuel new sieges of government and regulatory
growth. This time the monsters bear the names of Milken, Gates and Malone--new
trolls to terrify little children and cause competitors to cozen Washington
and judges to reach for their RICO bludgeons and commissioners to salivate
and shuffle subpoenas and senators to tremble and wreak new tomes of law
and bureaucrats to sow the economy with minefields of abstruse new rules.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three new monsters, big government managed to deliver us first from
Michael Milken, depicted as a Banker Shark. But Milken's vision impregnably
survives in the form of the industries and infrastructures he financed,
chiefly cellular phones, fiber optics and cable television--the forces that
laid the foundation for a new broadband economy.<BR>
<BR>
With Milken laid low by cancer and the courts, Washington needed new monsters
for the 1990s. After serious and continuing contemplation of Bill Gates
as a possible MicroShark hidden amid the mazes of Windows and DOS, Washington
recently has focused on the formidable visage of John Malone.<BR>
<BR>
As the titan of cable and leader of Tele-Communications Inc., better known
as TCI, he was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Milken's bonds. At a time
when governments everywhere covet the huge, new wealth emerging from information
superhighways, Malone has become the favored target of the Loch Ness news
hounds and public-law pinstripes: an Abominable Snowman ranging down from
the Rockies to raid and ruin rival companies, terrorize politicians and
gouge his 21 million customers. Or, in the words of then Senator Albert
Gore, Malone is Darth Vader himself.<BR>
<BR>
This particular monster hunt, however, could not be more ill- timed. There
is no way that this administration can demonize the cable industry and micromanage
telecom without direly damaging all its hopes for an information superhighway
and thus the best prospects for the future of the U.S. economy. Just as
the automobile industry was the real heir to the triumphs of the &quot;robber
barons&quot; in oil, steel and finance, so the computer industry--the core
of U.S. world industrial leadership--will be the chief beneficiary of cable
and telecom ventures in broadband networks.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. now commands global dominance in computer technology. But as Andrew
Grove told Forbes ASAP, &quot;infinite processing power will only get you
so far with limited bandwidth.&quot; The next generation of computer progress
depends upon the efficient use of cable bandwidth to homes and home offices,
which comprise a fist-growing 60 percent of the current market for computers.
Even if computer executives fail to see the threat, the monster hunt against
cable thus jeopardizes the supreme achievement of the American economy over
the last decade--its global lead in computers.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government constantly reiterates its desire for information superhighways.
The problem is that punctuating the call for broadband nets is an insistent
mantra of &quot;competition&quot; that reverberates through the speeches
of nearly all participants in the debate. As Ward White, vice-president
of government affairs for the U.S. Telephone Association, points out, however,
this mantra of competition &quot;disguises a new scheme of market allocation
run by the regulators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In this competition no one can win or make any money. The $ 10 billion in
profits claimed by the Baby Bells still under the Greene thumb are highly
questionable. Most of their copper wires and narrowband switches--rapidly
obsolescing by any objective standard--are being written off over decades.
That means the real costs of the Bells should be much higher than their
announced costs, which do not adequately reflect the fact that their $ 300
billion worth of plant and equipment is rapidly losing market value. As
TCI's sharp and salty young COO, Brendan Clouston, points out, telephone
companies are used to pretending to make money under rate-of-return regulations
when they are really losing it.<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies, by contrast, are used to pretending to lose money when
in fact they are raking it in. A standing joke around the offices of John
Malone's cable empire, which comprises TCI and Liberty Media, asks what
Malone will do if the firm ever reports a large profit. The answer: Fire
the accountant. Indeed, TCI did not report even a cosmetic profit until
the first quarter of 1993. Cable firms were financed with junk bonds and
other debt that allows investors to be paid off with tax- deductible interest
payments rather than double-taxed dividends and capital gains favored by
the telcos.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Milken, the financial father of the cable industry, channeled some
$ 10 billion in high-yield securities to TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom
and other cable firms at a time when they were struggling for survival.
As a result, the cable companies are eight times more leveraged in their
debt-equity ratios than telephone companies are. But driven by the demands
of debt, the cable firms use their capital some two-and-a-half times more
efficiently. Generating $ 20 billion in revenues, one-fourth as much as
the telcos, cable firms use just one-tenth the capital.<BR>
<BR>
The cable companies are leveraged at a rate of between seven- and ten-to-one
on their cash flow. Moreover, some 60 percent of cable company assets are
&quot;good will.&quot; Included in the purchase price of new acquisitions,
&quot;good will&quot; represents the intangible value of cash flows and
synergies expected from new technologies and programming.<BR>
<BR>
Built on vision and debt, such entrepreneurial companies cannot invest without
the possibility of large returns. Attack the cable industry's cash flow
and prospects, and you attack its lifeline. Attack the cable industry's
cash flow and prospects, and you reduce its available investment by a factor
of five or more. Bell Atlantic was originally willing to pay for TCI nearly
12 times its cash flow. 
<PRE><B>

The Real Monster:  Government
</B></PRE>
In this highly leveraged arena government itself is the real monster: an
800-pound gorilla. Where does the 800-pound gorilla sit? Wherever it wants.
Early in April of this year it chose to sit on the cable industry. More
specifically, it plumped down in the middle of Brendan Clouston's desk in
the form of a 700-page FCC document reregulating the cable industry. It
was full of detailed regulations on everything from how fast he must pick
up his phones for customer complaints and what he should charge for each
tier of service and for each component of cable gear, to how large, implicitly,
his return on investment can be (about 11.5 percent). He faced the mandate
to adjust nearly every price and policy in the company within six weeks
and to justify each price by filling out 60 pages of forms. In a menacing
note for the future portending new government plans for redistributionist
pricing, he is required to report the median income in each of his service
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is not really to blame for this onslaught, since it resisted the
new congressional power grab. In any case, this agency is only part of Clouston's
problem. He also faces an aggressive new spirit at the Federal Trade Commission,
at the Department of Justice and in Congress, which permits him to collaborate
with any company as long as it is not a telephone firm with useful fiber
networks and switching systems in TCI's own regions. Full of rhetoric inviting
every industry from the telcos to the power companies into the cable trade,
many of the legislative proposals, FTC policies and FCC ukases converging
on Clouston's desk seem to be intended to transform cable from a galvanizing
entrepreneurial force in the U.S. economy into a sleepy-time public utility
run by lawyers. At stake is the future of the information superhighway and
thus the future of the U.S. economy. 
<PRE>
<B>

Superhighway Hype is Understated
</B></PRE>
Information superhighways are one of those rare technologies that are actually
far more powerful and promising than the hype surrounding them. The first
fruits of this development are already evident, as the U.S. has led the
world in deploying computer networks. Over the next five years broadband
networks can transform the entire economy, projecting it onto a higher plane
of growth and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For the last decade the performance of the economy has perplexed the economics
profession. Throughout the 1980s most economists predicted that U.S. interest
rates would soar as a result of world-lagging rates of personal savings.
When interest rates instead dropped, economists pointed to a &quot;dangerous
dependence&quot; on foreign sources of capital such as Japan, which were
investing close to $ 100 billion annually in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Today, adverse tax and regulatory policies in the U.S. have entirely reversed
capital flows, with funds now leaving the U.S. for foreign markets at an
annual rate of $ 80 billion. Meanwhile, as Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey has warned, personal savings have plunged to all-time lows. By every
rule of economics, interest rates should soar or growth should collapse.<BR>
<BR>
Yet despite a slight upward drift in recent months, U.S. interest rates
remain low by historic standards, and the U.S. continues to lead the major
powers in economic growth and has extended its lead in productivity. As
Michael Jensen of Harvard Business School has shown, a close analysis of
the figures from U.S. corporations now reveals a historic acceleration of
U.S. productivity growth during the 1980s. According to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley, between 1987 and 1992 U.S. corporations captured some 47.7 percent
of global profits and 37.4 percent of global sales. Continued slumps in
Europe and Japan combined with reviving growth in the U.S. indicate that
U.S. market share is still rising.<BR>
<BR>
This record of supremacy is entirely baffling to the economics profession
and its megaphones in the media. Focusing on the Loch Ness news, they have
spent a decade in lamentations over the prospects of the U.S. economy, reaching
a pitch of funereal keening during the 1992 election campaigns. But to analysts
focused on the ever-growing U.S. lead in technology, these results are no
mystery at all.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. supremacy is focused on information tools and spearheaded by computer
networks. U.S. companies command some two-thirds of the world's profits
in information technology, hardware and software, and entirely dominate
world markets in computer networks. Half the world's 110 million personal
computers are in the U.S., and between 1989 and 1993 the share connected
to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate information industry is finance. During the last decade the
U.S. employed information technology to transform its financial system.
Spearheaded by Milken and a $ 200 billion junk bond market, the U.S. drastically
reduced the role of banks and proliferated an array of more flexible and
specialized financial agencies. While over the last 12 years banks' share
of private credit for non-financial companies dropped from two- thirds to
less than 20 percent, the U.S. surged into global leadership in applying
information technology to the field of financial innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm shattered the financial system into
silicon smithereens and vastly enhanced its productivity. As the late Warren
Brookes has written, &quot;If every bank is nothing more than an information
system, then by definition every information system has the capacity to
be a bank, and every owner of an information system, from a desktop computer
to a mainframe terminal, can be a banker.&quot; What happened was that thousands
of brokers, mathematicians, financial consultants, insurance salespeople,
credit card merchants and bonds traders took this opportunity to break into
the field of financial entrepreneurship.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the U.S. set an entirely new world standard for capital efficiency,
generating far more economic growth per dollar of savings than any other
country. As explained two centuries ago by Adam Smith, key to productivity
growth is the refinement of the division of labor, the expansion of specialization,
the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and niches. The key force fostering
specialization in the U.S. is computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade computer networks will expand their bandwidth by factors
of thousands and reconstruct the entire U.S. economy in their image. TV
will expire and transpire into a new cornucopia of choice and empowerment.
Great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to
rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities. The most
deprived ghetto child in the most blighted project will gain educational
opportunities exceeding those of today's suburban preppie. Small towns will
become industrial centers in the new information economy. Hollywood and
Wall Street will totter and diffuse to all points of the nation and the
globe. Families will regroup around the evolving silicon hearths of a new
cottage economy. Video culture will transcend its current mass-media doldrums,
playing to lowest-common-denominator shocks and prurient interests, and
will effloresce into a plethora of products suggestive of the book industry.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or down the street or in their local office or corporation.
Instead, they will seek out and command their first choices in employment,
culture, entertainment and religion. They will reach out across the country
and around the world to find the best colleagues for every major project.
Productivity and efficiency will inexorably rise. A culture of first choices
will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward the mediocre,
convenient or crude.<BR>
<BR>
The entire centralizing force of the Industrial Revolution, which brought
capital and labor together in vast pyramidal institutions and reduced workers
to accessories of the machine and the tube, will give way to the explosive
centrifuge of the microcosm and telecosm. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and Machine Age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
The vision of information superhighways revitalizing the American economy
and culture is far more true and compelling than even its advocates comprehend.
People who underestimate the impact of bandwidth will miss the supreme investment
opportunities of the epoch. 
<PRE><B>

Decline and Rise of the Malone Model
</B></PRE>
Dominant in the industry are two essential models for fulfilling the promise
of the superhighway. One scheme, long associated with John Malone and other
cable executives, is the monster model: combining content and conduit in
order to gain monopoly rents.<BR>
<BR>
Because it reaches more than 20 percent of all cable customers, access to
the TCI conduit can heavily influence the success or failure of any content
venture. As Andrew Kessler, partner and multimedia guru at Unterberg Harris
and Forbes ASAP columnist, puts it, &quot;If you want to create a cable
channel, you may have to send it through Malone's bottleneck--a satellite
dish farm outside Denver. I suspect that could cost you some $ 4 million
in cash, or, alternatively, you can give Malone 30 percent of your company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This monster model is in essence the way Malone built up Liberty Media and
the content side of TCI, which together own parts of TNT, the Discovery
Channel, American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment TV, Court TV, Encore,
Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network, QVC, Video Jukebox and an
array of regional sports networks. It has been widely reported that AT&T
and financier Herbert Allen are creating a new classic sports network and
will give a chunk of it to Liberty in exchange for access to Malone's conduit.<BR>
<BR>
The other model is that of the common-carrier, upheld both by the telephone
companies and by Internet. In this model you build an open conduit and exercise
virtually no influence on content. Using the phone system or Internet, people
can communicate anything they want as long as they observe the protocols
of the public switched telephone network or of Internet's TCP/IP. Extended
to images, this model suggests a &quot;video dial tone.&quot; You can dial
up any other machine connected to the network and download or upload any
films, files, documents, pictures or multimedia programs that you wish.
Although telephone companies or Internet providers may own content. they
cannot privilege their own programming. Their content has to compete for
customers freely with all other content available on the network.<BR>
<BR>
The notoriety of the Malone model and the resentment it arouses far and
wide explain much of the hostility toward the cable industry and John Malone.
This may even explain the current rage to reregulate the industry. The great
irony today is that Malone and the rest of the cable leaders were in the
process of abandoning the Malone model at the very moment that many telephone
executives seemed to adopt it.<BR>
<BR>
It was Malone, after all, who was willing to sell his content to Bell Atlantic,
and it was Raymond Smith, above all, who insisted on acquiring the assets
of Liberty Media. It was Bell South that was willing to pitch in some $
2 billion to QVC's bidding for Paramount when John Malone left Batty Diller
high and dry. Ameritech, too, was reported to be preparing a pitch for Paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Malone was right in his attempt to sell out at the top to Bell Atlantic.
The idea of combining conduit and content was valid in a regime of bandwidth
scarcity. In a regime of broadband information superhighways, however, content
providers will want to put their programming on everyone's conduits, and
conduit owners will want to carry everyone's content. In a world of bandwidth
abundance Paramount will not want to restrict its films to Bell South's
network any more than Bell South will exclude films from other sources.<BR>
<BR>
The key condition for the success of the open model and the eclipse of the
Malone model, however, is real bandwidth abundance. If the federal government
prohibits the interconnection of conduits, then the Malone model gains a
new lease on life. In a world of bandwidth scarcity the owner of the conduit
not only can but must control access to it. Thus, the owner of the conduit
also shapes the content. It does not matter whether the conduit company
is headed by a scheming monopolist or by Mitch Kapor and the members of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Bandwidth scarcity will require the
managers of the network to determine the video programming on it.<BR>
<BR>
In a world of information superhighways, however, the most open networks
will dominate, and the proprietary networks will wither. Malone's understanding
of this fact--that his own model would soon expire in an environment of
bandwidth abundance--motivated his effort to merge with Bell Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm inexorably dictates mergers not between content
and conduit, but between conduit and conduit. In particular, today it mandates
the merger of the huge fiber resources of the telephone companies--which
are nine times as extensive as cable industry fiber and are estimated to
rise to 2.7 million lines by next year--with the huge asset of 57 million
broadband links to homes commanded by the cable industry. Obstructing such
mergers in the name of competition, or antitrust, or regulatory caprice,
is wantonly destructive to the future of the economy. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Siren Call From Foreign Shores
</B></PRE>
Most of the gains of the telecosm depend on government willingness to allow
the creation of coherent broadband networks with no prohibitions against
the convergence of cable and telco systems. For a while it appeared that
the Clinton administration was willing to accommodate this development.
Now it appears that it prefers to lead the U.S. government into a private-sector
monster hunt. Rather than releasing America's cable and telco firms to build
this redemptive infrastructure, Washington leaders seem chiefly concerned
with assuring themselves that no one will make any money from it. As a result,
with some $ 1 billion in annual funding from Wall Street, cable and telephone
firms are increasingly moving abroad to fulfill the promise of information
superhighways.<BR>
<BR>
TCI and U.S. West, for example, are serving some quarter- million British
citizens with combined telephone and cable functions over a hybrid network
of coax and fiber. The current regulatory climate dooms the proposed merger
of Southwestern Bell and Cox Cable and their plans to launch information
highways in Phoenix and Atlanta. But these companies continue to expand
their hybrid cable and phone networks In Liverpool and Birmingham in England.
In the U.S. NYNEX has been one of the most sluggish Bells in information
superhighway projects. But from Gibraltar to Bangkok, it is supplying an
array of wireless and wireline services. In the U.K. NYNEX Cablecomm holds
17 cable franchises passing 2.5 million homes and plans some $ 2 billion
in future investments. In the wake of the new regulations Bell Canada International
(BCI) reduced its offer for Jones Intercable by five percent, but the two
companies are barging ahead in East London, Leeds and Aylesbury. Time Warner,
Ameritech and other cable and telephone companies are also rushing to less
regulated realms to lay information infrastructure everywhere from Scotland
to New Zealand.<BR>
<BR>
In the U.S. such collaborations of cable and telephone companies would be
paralyzed by litigation and bureaucracy. It appears increasingly possible
that despite the huge lead created by the U.S. cable industry, which, unique
in the world, has extended broadband access to some 95 percent of American
homes, broadband networks will first be built outside the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
American politicians must face reality. With cable, the U.S. is far and
away the world leader in broadband technology. With cable, the U.S. can
have a national network reaching every American community by the year 2000.
Without cable, however, the U.S. can forget the idea of building a national
system of information superhighways in this decade. Without cable, the global
race is even, and several European and Asian countries command a significant
edge as a result of their integrated cable and telephone firms.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. panacea of &quot;competition&quot; without winners may work for
commodity markets, which require low levels of incremental investment and
offer returns commensurate with the rate of interest. Governing technological
progress, though, is the very different regime of dynamic competition and
creative destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling most technology investment is the pursuit of transitory positions
of monopoly that may yield massive profits. That's why in the late 1970s
and early 1980s Milken directed some $ 17 billion to the cable TV, fiberoptic
telephony and cellular telephone industries, giving the U.S. a decisive
lead in all these areas. That's why Intel Corp. has been investing $ 2 billion
a year in new wafer fabrication capacity to secure its global edge in microprocessors.
That's why Microsoft invests $ 1 billion a year or more (depending on definitions)
in new software technology to integrate ever-new functions into its dominant
operating systems. And that's why Bell Atlantic contemplated investing what
amounted to some $ 33 billion in John Malone's company, TCI.<BR>
<BR>
Until replaced by a better system, every innovation gives its owner a temporary
monopoly. Otherwise it is not a true innovation. Today, whether anyone likes
it or not, the cable industry has a temporary monopoly on broadband links
to the home. By interconnecting these links to the fiber networks of the
phone companies, the two industries together can create a national information
superhighway some five or 10 years sooner than can Japan or Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Some 79 percent of the costs of a network come in the final connections
to homes: the distribution and drops that the cable industry has installed
over the last 25 years. Joined with the telephone industry's fiber optics--nine
times more extensive than the cable industry's fiber deployment--this hybrid
cable-telco network would represent an authentic innovation and would trigger
a flood of real competition supplying a huge array of powerful new broadband
communications services. According to authoritative estimates cited by Vice-President
Gore and the FCC, these innovations would increase U.S. productivity growth
by 40 percent over the next decade. This immense undertaking would also
yield huge profits for as long as a decade to some of the companies that
master it.<BR>
<BR>
The government might regard these profits as &quot;obscene.&quot; But they
will be indispensable both to pay for the transformation of American media
and to attract the next generation of competitors into the business. These
rivals are already on the way: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), wireless
cellular &quot;cable&quot; at 28 gigahertz, low-earth-orbiting satellites
such as the Gates-McCaw Teledesic, all-fiber &quot;Internets&quot; and the
array of passive fiber- to-the-home technology summed up as the fibersphere.
Even broadcasters and utilities will enter the field. In a world where the
government micromanages communications in the name of &quot;competition,&quot;
however, all these capital-hungry competitors will languish. 
<PRE><B>

Dynamic Competition or Static Competitors?
</B></PRE>
The dynamics of competition on the information superhighway repeats the
previous dynamics of competition in computers. Preventing the dominance
of successful technologies--sustaining an artificial diversity--is anticompetitive.
If in the early 1980s the Department of Justice had ruled against the Microsoft
and Intel standards, for example, and had required a variety of microprocessor
instruction sets and operating systems, the result would have been less
competition in computers, not more. Perhaps Pick, Quarterdeck, Digital Research
and others would have gained share against Microsoft. But the applications
software business, with its floods of real competition in new programs for
everything from financial management to videogames, would have languished,
along with the parallel markets in hardware peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that Microsoft faces antitrust pressure at the twilight of its
dominance. Impelled by the new markets for multimedia and handheld communicators,
the industry is on the cusp of an entirely new landscape of competition.
In this new arena Microsoft's present market share and installed base are
barriers to entry for Microsoft rather than for its rivals. If Microsoft
is to prevail in these new areas, it must cannibalize its own systems and
compete on an equal basis with everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
The laws of dynamic competition apply just as forcefully to networks as
to computers. Just as the time arrived when text editing and disk utilities
would be integrated into operating systems--or floating point computations
would be integrated into microprocessors--broadband cable services now must
be integrated into the public switched telephone network (PSTN), not segregated
from it. Despite the &quot;competitive&quot; access dreams of politicians
and regulators, true competition requires that the &quot;two-wire model&quot;
of home communications give way to a broadband, one-wire system.<BR>
<BR>
The best and most cost-effective network practicable today is a combination
of telco fiber and cable coax. Even the telephone industry agrees. U.S.
West, Pacific Telesis and Bellcore all have resolved on the same hybrid
system that TCI, Time Warner and Cablelabs have pioneered. Without mergers
with cable firms, the telcos in essence will try to rebuild cable networks.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to duplicate the connections to homes built by the cable industry
over the last 25 years, however, the telephone industry would have to spend
some $ 200 billion. It would have to sustain this level of new investment
while maintaining its existing plant and expanding into long-distance and
other services. It would have to summon large incremental capital in the
face of continued competition from the cable industry's taking of many of
the most profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos currently declare they are willing to make these investments.
They tell Washington regulators and politicians that all will be fine as
long as they are allowed to own programming and information services and
build equipment. But the message from the markets is clear and to the contrary.
At the very time that telco executives were intoning their bold plans, telephone
and cable share prices were plunging toward new lows. Now Raymond Smith
of Bell Atlantic is announcing a half-billion- dollar reduction in infrastructure
outlays. Southwestern Bell is giving up its plans to buy Cox Cable. Under
a similar &quot;competitive&quot; regime in cellular telephony, even AT&T and
McCaw have found their merger in jeopardy.<BR>
<BR>
Under rate-of-return regulations with prohibition of cross- subsidies from
current cash flow, a &quot;competitive&quot; information superhighway simply
cannot fly. An information superhighway cannot be built under a canopy of
federal tariffs, price controls, mandates and allocated markets.

Highway Imperative:  Cable-PC</B></PRE>
Politicians must recognize that what is at stake is not merely games, entertainment
and a few educational frills but the very future of the U.S. economy. Cable
is central not only to the next generation of television technology but
also to the next generation of computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many companies offer bold words in business plans for interconnecting
homes with new networks. Indeed, the telcos can provide some intriguing
computer services through their accelerating rollout of Integrated Services
Digital Networks (ISDN), as was so eloquently urged by Mitch Kapor and others.
Internet will continue to expand rapidly its cornucopia of mostly narrowband
offerings. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw may even enlarge the bandwidth available
to homes to a level of 2.4 megabits per second through their elegant and
ambitious Teledesic. Direct broadcast satellite systems and public utilities
and wireless cable operators will all enrich the flow of video to the nation's
homes.<BR>
<BR>
Except in the short ran, though, these systems are not remotely competitive
with cable. Available ISDN, for example, offers less than one-100th the
bandwidth of one digital cable channel and less than one-1,000th the bandwidth
of a cable coax line. The other rivals to cable, from direct broadcast satellite
to Teledesic, are similarly far too little and too late. Even the advanced
28-gigahertz wireless cable projects, for all their promise as supplementary
systems, cannot ultimately compete with the potential two-way bandwidth
of fiber-coax systems in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
All the current plans of the telephone companies and the government leave
the huge U.S. endowment of home computers--the fastest-growing and most
promising segment of the computer industry--stranded in a narrowband world.
Only the cable industry's gigahertz links, passing into some 95 percent
of American homes, can launch the American personal computer industry into
a new level of two-way broadband digital connectivity.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason the future of the American computer industry largely depends
on the future of the cable industry. By linking America's computers to broadband
networks and then to telco fiber systems, cable can be the great enabler
of the next phase of development in America's digital economy.<BR>
<BR>
In laying broadband systems the cable industry has already been forced to
solve many of the key problems of an information superhighway. Although
often depicted as an intrinsically one- way service, cable technology has,
in fact, long provided two-way capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
Every cable coax line, for example, offers potential bandwidth equivalent
to six times the 160 megahertz of spectrum assigned by the FCC for personal
communications services. Cable can accommodate as much as one gigahertz--a
billion cycles per second--of communications power. This is some 250,000
times the capacity of a four-kilohertz telephone line to the home. Just
one six-megahertz cable channel commands 1,500 times the bandwidth of a
telephone line. In every coax connection the first four channels, between
five and 30 megahertz, are reserved not for broadcast but for reverse communications
to the headend. Widely used to transfer video programming among headends
and satellite dishes and other programming sources, these channels alone
already represent a potential information highway for home computers 2,500
times faster than a 9,600-baud modem to a phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Even these possibilities, however, underestimate the potential of cable.
The coax laid by the cable firms must carry analog video material without
interference or distortion. This means cable equipment must track perfectly
all the analog waveforms representing the shape and brightness of the image,
and must detect tiny differences in the frequencies of FM signals bearing
color and sound information. Because any deviation in an analog wave imparts
a defect to the picture, cable TV has had to develop extremely low loss
technologies. Although most current cable systems function at much lower
signal-to-noise ratios, measured logarithmically, a cable TV plant can potentially
function at nearly 50 decibels, or at a signal-to-noise power ratio of almost
100,000-to-one.<BR>
<BR>
Necessary to transmit high-quality analog video, between 10,000- and 100,000-to-1
signal-to-noise ratios are vast overkill for the relatively crude on-off
codes of digital communications, which can function at 17 decibels or less.
Therefore, the one- gigahertz coax lines can carry many more than one bit
per hertz. Craig Tanner, vice-president of advanced TV projects at Cablelabs,
the industry's research arm in Louisville, Colo., estimates that by wiggling
every wave in readable patterns using a modulation scheme called 256 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation), cable systems can transmit as many as
seven bits per hertz. This means that the one-gigahertz bandwidth of an
existing cable line might potentially carry between six and eight gigabits
per second, or more than three gigabits per second each way. These potential
links to homes are more capacious than the current telephone fiber lines
that accommodate tens of thousands of phone calls among telco central offices.<BR>
<BR>
This bandwidth represents the real potential of cable coax. For the next
decade much of the cable plant will still be devoted to analog TV broadcasts
or to digital renditions of pay-per-view movies. Time Warner's Orlando project,
however, envisions devoting the top 350 megahertz of its system to two-way
digital communications, including 100 megahertz for the personal communications
services of wireless telephony and 150 megahertz for digital two-way data
flows. At a very conservative estimate of two bits per hertz, Time Warner
projects a total of 300 megabits per second from these digital channels.
At these levels a computer could download a full movie of two-and-a-half
hours in about one minute.

Cable's Real Potential is Not TV</B></PRE>
Abandonment of the Malone model by Malone and the rest of the cable industry
ultimately requires that cable TV magnates develop a new grasp of the dynamics
of the microcosm: the exponential growth of computer power and connections.
Accustomed to the role of propagating mass entertainment, cable leaders
have long downplayed the potential market in computer communications.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually growing throughout TCI, Time Warner, Continental Cablevision,
Jones Intercable and other cable firms, however, is a recognition that the
real future of cable is in computers rather than TVs. As David Fellows of
Continental declared in launching his pioneering new Internet access system
in Boston In late February, &quot;The market for computer communications
is huge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, during the next decade the cable companies are going to discover
that the computer market for their services is far more important than the
television market. The computer industry, hardware and software, is already
some 60 percent larger than the television and movie industries put together
and is growing six times as fast. On-line networked computer services, such
as Prodigy, CompuServe, Delphi and America Online, are collectively growing
at a pace of close to 100 percent per year. When on-line services can exchange
video and audio files as readily as they transfer text today, these computer
networks will be able to outperform any television system. Against all their
expectations and plans, cable executives are going to find themselves a
central part of the computer networking industry.<BR>
<BR>
As Fellows explains, &quot;Cable and computer network topologies go together
perfectly. Both provide shared bandwidth. Ethernet over cable is a natural.&quot;
In both networks all the data flow by every terminal. The receiver tunes
into the desired channel. For computers, cable offers the dumb bandwidth
that is increasingly needed as terminals gain near-supercomputer powers.
In the past networks had to be smart in order to provide needed services
to the dumb terminals on their periphery, whether phones, computers or TVs.
Dumb terminals could tolerate narrowband connections. In the future, however,
all terminals will command supercomputer powers.<BR>
<BR>
When terminals are smart, the intelligence in networks flows to the fringes.
When terminals are smart, networks must be broad and dumb. There is no way
that an intelligent switching fabric can anticipate the constantly evolving
technology emerging from a computer industry in a frenzied process of change.
There is no way that John Malone's satellite farm outside Denver will be
able to satisfy the demands for programming and communications of 100 million
networked teleputers. While the telephone business struggles with the increasing
problems of intelligent central switches with some 25 million lines of software
code, the cable industry is creating dumb networks in tune with the explosive
growth of supersmart machines in every home and office.<BR>
<BR>
The movement of computer networks onto cable need not await the development
of advanced broadband systems such as those planned by Time Warner in Orlando.
Already several companies are supplying moderns that allow computers to
link directly to cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith provided the first system, HomeWorks, operating at a rate of 500
kilobits per second. It is being used by Cox Cable to deliver Prodigy service
in San Diego at a rate 52 times faster than existing 9,600-baud phone modems.
Also using HomeWorks is Jones Intercable for Internet services in Alexandria,
Va., Continental Cablevision and CompuServe in Exeter, N.H., and TCI for
a distance learning test in Provo, Utah.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith is adding a system called ChannelMizer that can offer full Ethernet
capability of 10 megabits per second over a 15-mile radius. Intel, General
Instrument and Hybrid Technologies have announced an asymmetrical system
that runs upstream from the home at 256 kilobits per second and downstream
at 10 megabits per second, the Ethernet rate run in most office networks.<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering in the field for several years has been Digital Equipment Corp.
under the leadership of James Albrycht. Adapting equipment developed by
LANcity, DEC's ChannelWorks offers the functionality needed for true information
highway on-ramps. Extending a two-way Ethernet transparently from the office
to the home by a full 70 miles, the ChannelWorks frequency-agile modem allows
the use of all 83 cable frequency channels. Cable managers can send digital
information over any underused part of the coax bandwidth. Currently deployed
chiefly by telecommuting Digital employees, the system is under evaluation
by a variety of hospitals, libraries, schools and other institutions favored
by Vice-President Gore.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely crucial to the development of the broadband superhighway, however,
is not only the merger of the two networks but also access to the capital
of the telephone industry. Creation of high-bandwidth cable connections
to homes will be far cheaper than laying new coax. But they still will require
expensive upgrades to existing cable plant.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos already invest more money every year--some $ 24 billion--than
the total revenues of the cable industry. But even the telcos will not be
able to create information superhighways if they also have to duplicate
the broadband connections to homes already offered by the cable industry.
Similarly, the cable industry alone cannot attract sufficient funds to duplicate
the broadband fiber networks already commanded by the telcos, while the
telcos move in to skim off the best pay-per-view movie markets. Particularly
in an adverse regulatory climate neither industry is capable of building
broadband networks. With relatively narrowband networks, the Malone model
necessarily thrives. In the name of fighting monsters the administration
is in fact pursuing what amounts to a monster-protection policy.<BR>
<BR>
If this policy continues, innovation once more will follow its course toward
the least-regulated arenas. Cable and telco firms will install their best
technologies overseas. In the U.S. the computer networking industry will
build the information superhighways. To Gore's bitter regret, only business
and the wealthy will be able to afford access. Until the early decades of
the next century, much of the rest of the nation will be left to the mercies
of the Malone model for video entertainment and other cable programming.
Interactivity will tend to take the form of games and pay-per-view TV.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with the increasing movement of activity from big cities, corporate
headquarters, hospitals, schools and other centralized institutions to homes
and small cities, the demand for broadband computer connections is sure
to soar. Most current congressional legislation that imposes mandates on
businesses relating to everything from health care reform to parental leave
tends to drive work away from corporations to contractual outsources. The
market for &quot;interactive TV&quot; is likely to grow far more slowly
than the market for computer connections over cable.<BR>
<BR>
Both political parties are far behind the public in comprehending these
developments. But the reversal of the earlier forces of conurbation and
centralized industry responds to the most profound laws of new technology.
It is the most important movement in America today. If the administration
continues to strangle new technology with new regulation and red tape, a
new coalition of liberals and conservatives alike will rise up against it
and grasp the future. Al Gore may eventually wish he had never heard of
broadband networks.

Imagine it is 1971 and you are chair of the new Federal Computer Commission.
This commission has been established to regulate the natural monopoly of
computer technology as summed up in the famous Grosch's Law. In 1956 IBM
engineer Herbert Grosch proved that computer power rises by the square of
its cost and thus necessarily gravitates to the most costly machines. According
to a famous IBM projection, the entire world could use some 55 mainframes,
time-sharing from dumb terminals and keypunch machines. The owners of these
machines would rule the world of information in an ascendant information
age. By the Orwellian dawn of 1984, Big Bre'r IBM would establish a new
digital tyranny, with a new elite of the data-rich dominating the data-poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As head of the computer commission, you launch a bold program to forestall
this grim outcome. Under a congressional mandate to promote competition
for IBM and ensure the principle of universal computer service, you ordain
the creation of some 2,500 mainframe licenses to be auctioned to the highest
bidders (with special licenses reserved for minorities, women and farmers).
To ensure widespread competition across all of America, you establish seven
licenses in each metropolitan Major Trading Area and seven in every rural
Basic Trading Area as defined by Rand McNally. To guarantee universal service,
you mandate the free distribution of keypunch machines to all businesses
and households so that they can access the local computer centers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In establishing this auction in 1971, you had no reason at all to notice
that a tiny company in Mountain View, Calif., called Intel was about to
announce three new technologies together with some hype about &quot;a new
era of integrated electronics.&quot; After all, these technologies--the
microprocessor; erasable, programmable read-only memory (EPROM); and a one-kilobit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM)--were far too primitive to even compare
with IBM's massive machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The likely results of such a Federal Computer Commission policy are not
merely matters of conjecture. France pretty much did it when it distributed
free Minitel terminals to its citizens to provide them access to government
mainframes. While the United States made personal computers nearly ubiquitous
buying perhaps 100 million since the launch of the Minitel in the late 1970s
the French chatted through central databases and ended up with one-quarter
as many computers per capita as this country, and one-tenth the number of
computer networks. Today, PC networks are leading the US economy to world
dominance while Europe founders without a single major computer company,
software firm or semiconductor manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT IS NOW 1994, and Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, is indeed about to hold an auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than selling exclusive mainframe licenses, the current FCC is going
to sell exclusive ten-year licenses to about 2,500 shards of the radio spectrum.
Meanwhile, a tiny company called Steinbrecher Corp. of Burlington, Mass.,
is introducing the new microprocessor of the radio business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the world of radio waves ruled by the Federal Communications Commission,
the Steinbrecher MiniCell is even more revolutionary than the microprocessor
was in the world of computing. While Intel put an entire computer on a single
chip, Steinbrecher has put an entire cellular base station--now requiring
some 1,000 square feet and costing $ 1.5 million--in a box the size of a
briefcase that costs $ 100,000 today. Based on a unique invention by Donald
Steinbrecher and on the sweeping advance of computer technology, the MiniCell
represents a far bigger leap forward beyond the current state of the art
than the microprocessor did. What's more, this MiniCell is in fact much
superior to existing cellular base stations. Unlike the 416 hard-wired radio
transceivers (transmitter-receivers) in existing base stations, the MiniCell
contains a single digital broadband radio and is fully programmable. It
can accommodate scores of different kind of cellular handsets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important, the MiniCell benefits from the same technology as the microprocessor.
Making possible the creation of this broadband digital radio is the tidal
onrush of Moore's Law. In an antithesis of Grosch's Law, Gordon Moore of
Intel showed that the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology doubles
every 18 months. This insight suggested the Law of the Microcosm-- that
computing power gravitates not to the costliest but to the cheapest machines.
Costing $ 100,000 today, the MiniCell will predictably cost some $10,000
before the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In time, these digital MiniCells will have an impact similar to that of
the PC. They will drive the creation of a cornucopia of new mobile services--from
plain old telephony to wireless video conferencing--based on ubiquitous
client/server networks in the air. Endowing Americans with universal mobile
access to information superhighways, these MiniCells can spearhead another
generation of computer-led growth in the US economy. Eventually, the implications
of Steinbrecher's machines and other major innovations in wireless will
crash In on the legalistic scene of the FCC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning of the story.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on the block In May will be 160 megahertz (millions of cycles per
second) of the radio frequency spectrum, divided into seven sections of
between 10 and 30 megahertz In each of 543 areas of the country, and devoted
to enhanced Personal Communications Services (PCS).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Existing cellular systems operate in a total spectrum space of 50 megahertz
in two frequency bands near the 800 megahertz level. By contrast, PCS will
take four times that space in a frequency band near two gigahertz (billions
of cycles per second). Became higher frequencies allow use of lower-power
radios with smaller antennas and longer-lasting batteries, PCS offers the
possibility of a drastically improved wireless system. Unfortunately, the
major obstacle to the promise of PCS is the auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amid the spectrum fever aroused by the bidding, however, new radio technologies
are emerging that devastate its most basic assumptions. At a time when the
world is about to take to information superhighways In the sky--plied by
low-powered, pollution-free computer phones--the FCC is in danger of building
a legal infrastructure and protectionist program for information smokestacks
and gas guzzlers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used to describe the auction betrays its fallacies. With
real estate imagery, analysts depict spectrum as &quot;beachfront property&quot;
and the auction as a &quot;land rash.&quot; They assume that radio frequencies
are like analog telephone circuit: no two users can occupy the same spot
of spectrum at the same time. Whether large 50-kilowatt broadcast stations
booming Rush Limbaugh's voice across the nation or milliwatt cellular phones
beaming love murmurs to a nearby base station, radio transmitters are assumed
to be infectious, high-powered and blind. If one is on the highway, everyone
else has to clear out. Both the prevailing wisdom and the entrenched technology
dictate that every transmitter be quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, innovations from such companies as Steinbrecher and Qualcomm Inc.
of San Diego overthrow this paradigm. Not only can numerous radios operate
at non-interfering levels in the same frequency band, they can also see
other users' signals and move to avoid them. In baseball jargon, the new
radios can hit 'em where they ain't; in football idiom, they run for daylight.
If appropriately handled, these technologies can render spectrum not scarce
but abundant.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These developments make it retrograde to assign exclusive spectrum rights
to anyone or to foster technologies that require exclusivity. Spectrum no
longer shares any features of beachfront property. A wave would be a better
analogy. 
<PRE><B>
The New Rules Of Waves</B></PRE>
In the early decades of this century, radio was king. Electronics hackers
played in the waves with a variety of ham, citizens band and short-wave
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Experimenting with crystal sets, they innocently entered the domain of solid-state
devices and acquired some of the skills that fueled the electronic revolution
in the United States and the radar revolution that won World War II. The
first point-contact transistor, created by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
at Bell Labs in 1948, functioned like a crystal radio. The first major solid-state
product was a 1954 Texas Instruments pocket radio with six germanium transistors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the following decades, the radio became a mass commodity. There are
now some 230 million radios in the United States alone, not even including
more than 16 million cellular phones (which are in fact portable two-way
radios). Radios roll off Asian assembly lines at a rate that might be meaningfully
measured in hertz (cycles per second), and they come in sizes fit for pockets,
belts, watches and ears. But the romance of radio has died and given way
to the romance of computers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today it is PC technology that engages the youthful energies previously
invested in radio technology. The press trumpets a coming convergence between
computers and TVs and games and films. But no one talks much about radios.
For many years, we have been taking radios for granted.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the foundation of wireless communications, however, radio--no less than
TV or films--will burst into a new technoscape as a result of a convergence
with computers. The hackers of the '50s and '60s are joining forces with
the hackers of the '80s and '90s to create a new industry. Moore's Law is
about to overran the world of radio.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You double anything every 18 months and pretty soon you find yourself with
a monster. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moore's Law overturned the established
order in the computer industry and spawned some 100 million personal computers
that are as powerful as million-dollar mainframes were when the revolution
began. In the current decade, Moore's Law is upending the telephone and
television industries with interactive teleputers that will be able to send,
receive, shape and store interactive full-motion video. And during the next
five years, Moore's Law is going to transform exotic and costly radio equipment
once consigned to the military and outer space into the basic communications
access routes for the new world economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To understand this new world of radio, however, you must forget much of
what you learned about the old world of radio. For example, these new radios
differ radically from the radios of the past in the way they use spectrum,
the way they interfere with one another and the way they are built.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For some 15 years, a hacker of the 1950s named Don Steinbrecher and a small
group of students and associates have been making the world's most powerful
and aerobatic radios. Steinbrecher radio gear can soar to spectrum altitudes
as high as 94 gigahertz to provide radar &quot;eyes&quot; for smart bombs
and pies, plunge down to the cellular band at 800 megahertz to listen in
on phone calls or drop discretely to 30 megahertz--waves that bounce off
the ionosphere--for remote over-the-horizon radar work identifying cocaine
traffickers flying in low from Latin America. At the same time, some of
these radios may soon command enough dynamic ranges of accurate broadband
reception--rumored to be as high as 120 decibels (one trillion-to-one)--to
detect a pin drop at a heavy-metal rock concert without missing a high-fidelity
note or twang.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like every radio transceiver, a Steinbrecher radio must have four key components:
an antenna, a tuner, a modem and a mixer. The antenna part is easy; for
many purposes, your metal shirt hanger will do the trick (backyard wire
fences collect millions of frequencies). But without tuners, modems and
mixers, nothing reaches its final destination--the human ear.<BR>
<BR>
A tuner selects a desired carrier frequency, usually by exploiting the science
of resonant circuits. A modem is a modulator-demodulator. In transmitting
it applies information to the carrier frequency by wiggling the waves in
a pattern, called a modulation scheme, such as AM or FM. In receiving the
modem strips out (demodulates) the information tom the carrier wave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to Steinbrecher radios is the broadband mixer. It surmounts what
was long seen as an impossible challenge: moving a large array of the relatively
high career frequencies on the antenna down to a so-called baseband level
where they can be used without losing any of the information or adding spurious
information in the process. Compared to FM carrier frequencies of 100 megahertz
or even PCS frequencies of two gigahertz, baseband audio frequencies run
between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mixers were the basic Steinbrecher product, and in 1978 and 1980, Steinbrecher
acquired patents on a unique broadband mixer with high range and sensitivity
called the Paramixer. Even to its expected military customers, the Paramixer
was a hard sell because other radio components were unable to keep pace
with its performance. Today, however, the Paramixer is the foundation of
the Steinbrecher radio in the MiniCell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the old world of radio, transceivers integrated all of these components--antenna,
tuner, modem and mixer--into one analog hardware system. Because the radio
is analog and hard-wired, its functions must be standardized. Each radio
can receive or transmit only a very limited set of frequencies bearing information
coded in a specific modulation scheme and exclusively occupying a specific
spectrum space at a particular power range. If you are in the radio business--whether
as an equipment manufacturer such as Motorola or Ericsson, a provider of
services, such as McCaw or Comsat, or a broadcaster, such as NBC or Turner--you
care deeply about these hard-wired specifications, frequencies and modulation
schemes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprising the &quot;air standard,&quot; these issues embroil businesses,
politicians, standards bodies and regulators in constant warfare. For everything
from High Definition Television to digital cellular and cordless telephony,
standards bodies are wrangling over frequencies and modulation schemes.
<PRE><B>

How Digital Radios Can End The Spectrum Wars</B></PRE>
To the people at Steinbrecher Corp., all these wrangles seem utterly unnecessary.
With antennas, tuners, modems and mixers, wideband digital radios perform
all the same functions as ordinary radios. Only the antenna and mixer are
in hardware, and these are generic; they don't care any more about air standards
than your shirt hanger does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Steinbrecher radios, all of the frequency tuning, all of the modulating
and demodulating, all of the channelization, all of the coding and decoding
that so embroil the politicians are performed by programmable digital signal
processors and can be changed at a base station in real time. Strictly speaking,
the tuner and modem are not part of the base station radio at all. The broadband
radio in a Steinbrecher base station can send or receive signals to or from
any handset or mobile unit operating within its bandwidth (in current cellular
systems the full 12.5 megahertz of the band; in PCS, still larger bands
of as much as 30 megahertz).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the processing of codes, frequencies, channels and modulations, as well
as all special mobile services, can move onto computers attached to the
network. Steinbrecher technology thus can open up the spectrum for open
and programmable client/server systems like those that now dominate the
computer industry. Moore's Law, in fact, is changing radios into portable
digital computers. The most pervasive personal computer of the next decade
will be a digital cellular phone operating at least 40 MIPS (millions of
instructions per second).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the performance of analog-to-digital converters defines the limits
of Steinbrecher radios. Even if the mixers are perfect, the system's performance
can be no better than the accuracy of the A/D processors that transform
the output of the mixers into a digital bit stream for the DSPs. Steinbrecher
estimates that better broadband A/D converters--which can sample wave forms
more accurately at high frequencies--could increase the performance ofSteinbrecher
systems by an amazing factor of 10. Pushed by demands and designs from Steinbrecher,
Analog Devices and other suppliers are advancing converter technology nearly
at a pace with Moore's Law, and Steinbrecher's broadband digital radios
are rapidly approaching the ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Don Steinbrecher puts it, broadband A/D and DSP have changed wireless
&quot;turn a radio business to a computer business.&quot; At first, the
computer portion of a broadband radio was very expensive. Until the early
1980s, military customers performed advanced broadband analog-to-digital
conversion and digital signal processing on million-dollar custom supercomputers.
In 1986, an advanced DSP system for graphics at Bell Labs entailed the use
of 82 AT&T DSP32 chips and supporting devices in a custom computer that
cost some $ 130,000. Today, these same functions are performed on an Apple
Quadra 84o AV using an AT&T 3210 running at 33 megaflops (million floating-point
operations per second) and 17 MIPS for under $ 20 in volume. This rising
tide of advances in digital technology, propelled by Moore's Law, is about
to sweep Steinbrecher's recondite radio company into the midst of a mass
market in cellular telephony.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the entire cellular and PCS industries will be beating a path to Steinbrecher's
door. Just as millions of people today have learned the meaning of MIPS
and megabytes, millions of people around the world, believe it or not, are
going to come to understand the meaning of &quot;spurious-free dynamic range.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a very rough analogy, imagine cranking the volume of your radio as high
as possible without marring the desired signal with static and distortion.
The spurious-free dynamic range of your radio would measure the distance
between the lowest and the highest volumes with a clear signal. In more
technical terms, spurious-free dynamic range is defined as the range of
signal amplitudes that can simultaneously be processed without distortion
or be resolved by a receiver without the emergence of spurious signals above
the noise floor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In building broadband radios with high dynamic range, however, Steinbrecher
faced a fundamental technical problem. As a general rule, bandwidth is inversely
proportional to dynamic range. You can have one or the other, but you can't
have both. The broader the band, the more difficult it is to capture all
of its contents with full accuracy and sensitivity or with full spurious-free
dynamic range. An ordinary radio may command a high dynamic range of volumes
because it is narrowband.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Steinbrecher radio does not begin by tuning to one frequency alone;
it gasps every frequency in a particular swath of spectrum. In some extreme
Paramixer applications (94-gigahertz radar, for example), the bandwidth
could be 10 gigahertz--larger than the entire range of spectrum commonly
used in the air, from submarine communications at 60 hertz to C band satellite
at 6 gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most Steinbrecher applications that require high dynamic range, however,
the bandwidth runs between a few megahertz and hundreds of megahertz (compared
to 30 kilohertz in a cellular phone). Unless all of the frequencies captured
by the broadband radio are really present in the band rather than as artifacts
of the equipment--in technical jargon, unless the signals are spurious-free--the
radio user cannot tell what is going on, cannot distinguish between spurs
and signals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher has devoted much of his career to the graft of spurious-free
dynamic range. Soon after he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in September 1961 to pursue work on device physics, he moved into the school's
new Radio Astronomy Lab. The radio astronomers were using millimeter waves
at 75 gigahertz to probe remote galaxies and pour through evidence of a
big bang at the beginning of time. Because the return reflections from outer
space were infinitesimal, the radio telescopes had to command a bandwidth
of at least two gigahertz, a spurious-free dynamic range of more than 100
decibels (tens of billions-, or even trillions-to-one) and noise levels
of less than 10 decibels (millionths of a watt).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telescope signals turned out not to be spurious-free. More than 90 percent
of the receiver noise--the spurious signals--originated in the frequency
converter or mixer, which translated the 75-gigahertz millimeter waves in
cascading analog stages of diodes and transistors, fed by tunable local
oscillators, down to baseband levels that could be usefully analyzed. This
impelled Steinbrecher's obsession with spurious-free dynamic range in mixers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve high dynamic range in broadband mixers, Steinbrecher discovered,
was chiefly a problem of the basic physics of diodes. At the University
of Florida, at ECI Corp. and at MIT, Steinbrecher had pursued studies in
device physics focusing on the theory of PIN junctions--the positive-negative
interfaces that create the active regions in diodes and transistors. How
cleanly and abruptly they switch from on to off--how fully these switches
avoid transitional effects--determines how well they can translate one frequency
to another without spurs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From this experience, Steinbrecher concluded in 1968 that receivers could
be built with at least a thousand times more dynamic range than was currently
believed possible. He assigned his student Robert Snyder to investigate
the issue mathematically, integrating the possible performance of each component
into the performance of a mixer. Snyder's results stunningly continued Steinbrecher's
hypothesis. They predicted that in principle--with unlimited time and effort--the
linearity and dynamic range of a radio could be improved to any arbitrary
standard. In a key invention, Steinbrecher figured out how to create a diode
circuit that could produce a perfect square wave, creating a diode with
essentially zero switching time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher then proceeded to put his theory into practice by developing
the crucial diode and field-effect transistor arrays, mixers, amplifiers
and other components necessary to build a working system of unparalleled
dynamic range. Most of their advances required detailed knowledge of the
behavior of P/N junctions. To this day, the performance of Steinbrecher's
equipment depends on adjustment to unexpected nonlinearities and noise sources
that were discovered as part of Robert Snyder's work but are still not integrated
into the prevailing models of diode behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond radio astronomy, the people who were interested in analyzing signals
of unknown frequencies, rather than tuning into preset frequencies, were
in the field of military intelligence. Enemies did not normally announce
in advance the frequencies they planned to use or how they would modulate
them. Steinbrecher Corp.'s first major contract came in the early 1980s
for remote over-the-horizon radar (ROTHR) systems used to detect planes
carrying drugs from Latin America. Steinbrecher also won contracts to supply
MILSTAR satellite transceivers and 94-gigahertz &quot;eyes&quot; for smart
munitions and jet aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 these large potential businesses began to attract venture capitalists,
including EG&G venture partners, The Venture Capital Fund of New England
and Raytheon. As often happens, the venture capitalists sought professional
management. They pushed Steinbrecher upstairs to chairman and summoned a
Stanford EE graduate named Douglas Shute to manage the company's move from
a manufacturer of hard-sell mixers Into a producer of revolutionary digital
radios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still, Steinbrecher Corp. long remained a tiny firm occupying a dingy one-story
building in a Woburn, Mass., industrial park, where it rarely pulled in
more than $ 5 million in revenues. Not until the early 1990s, when its technology
converged with Moore's Law, did the company begin to escape its niche. 
<PRE><B>
Collision With Texas Instruments' DSP</B></PRE>
Indeed, strictly speaking even Moore's Law was not enough to make this Pentagon
turkey fly. Crucial was Texas Instruments' mid-1980s campaign to remake
the digital signal processor into a commodity device comparable to Intel's
microprocessor. Creating development systems and software tools, TI transformed
the DSP from an exotic and expensive printed circuit board full of integrated
circuits into a single programmable microchip manufactured in volume on
the same factory floor the company used to produce hundreds of millions
of dynamic random access memories. The results exceeded all expectations.
Outpacing Moore's Law by a factor of nearly four for some eight years so
far, DSP cost-effectiveness began soaring tenfold every two years. Pricing
the devices for digital radios, Douglas Shute saw that the wideband digital
radio had &quot;moved onto the map as a commercial product.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also in 1989, a secret contractor asked the company if its radios could
snoop on calls in the cellular band. After gigahertz explorations in radio
astronomy and military projects, the 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth
seemed a piece of cake. Although this national security application never
came through, the idea galvanized the company. If it should need a commercial
market, cellular telephony was a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pull of opportunity, however, is usually less potent than the push of
catastrophe--which is the key reason for socialism's failure. Insulating
the economy from failure, it also removes a key spur for success. For all
the bureaucratic rigmarole of military procurement, producers for the Pentagon
live in a relatively comfortable socialist world of cost plus contracts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Steinbrecher
began to get clear signals from Washington that the market for his products
was about to collapse. MILSTAR remained an experimental program; the ROTHR
system was halted after the creation of just four stations with 1,600 mixers;
and suddenly the cellular opportunity was not merely an attractive option--it
was crucial for survival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Shute and Steinbrecher viewed the cellular scene in the United States,
however, they became increasingly disdainful. These radio companies had
no more idea of what was possible in radio technology than had the MIT engineering
lab when he arrived in 1961. Indeed, Steinbrecher Corp.'s first potential
customer--a wireless colossus--refused even to meet with Shute: The chief
technologist said he had investigated digital radios several years before
and determined they were unable to achieve the requisite dynamic range.
Moreover, at scores of thousands of dollars apiece, digital signal processors
were far too expensive. Most cellular executives, along with their Washington
regulators, seemed stuck in a 1970s time warp when analog still ruled and
DSP was a supercomputer. 
<PRE><B>
Importing Obsolescence</B></PRE>
As a result, the entire industry was convulsed by what Shute and Steinbrecher
saw as a retrograde war over standards. Because Europe in general lagged
far behind the United States in adopting analog cellular technology, the
EEC had sponsored a multinational drive to leapfrog the United States by
adopting a digital standard, which could then be exported to America. The
standard they chose was called GSM (global services mobile), a time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) scheme that exceeded analog capacity by breaking
each channel into three digital time slots. Racing to catch up, the American
industry adopted a similar TDMA approach that also increased the current
system's capacity by a factor of three. With McCaw Cellular in the lead,
American firms quickly committed themselves to deploy TDMA as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in 1991, Qualcomm unleashed a bombshell Exploiting the increasing power
of DSPs to process digital codes, the company demonstrated a spread-spectrum,
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) modulation scheme that not only increased
capacity some twentyfold over analog but also allowed use of the entire
11.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth in every cell. To prevent interference
between adjoining cells, analog and TDMA systems could use a frequency in
only one cell out of seven.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of the industry seemed paralyzed by fear of choosing the wrong system.
To Shute and Steinbrecher, however, these fears seemed entirely reckless.
Using wideband digital radios, companies could accommodate any array of
frequencies and modulation schemes they desired TDMA, CDMA, voice, data
and eventually even video. Shute resolved to adapt Steinbrecher's advanced
radio technology to these new markets. In mid-1991, Shute rushed ahead with
a program to create a prototype cellular transceiver that could process
all 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth and convert it to a digital
bit stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first major customer for the radios turned out to be ADC-Kentrox, a
designer of analog cell extenders designed to overcome &quot;dead zones&quot;
caused by large buildings in urban areas. This system was limited in reach
to the few hundred meters the signals could be sent over analog wires without
deterioration. By converting the signals to digital at the remote site,
the Steinbrecher radio extended this distance from hundreds of meters to
scores of kilometers and allowed the price of the product to remain at $
100,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these gains concealed the potential impact and meaning of the Steinbrecher
technology. Once again, the Steinbrecher radios are being used to complement
the existing system rather than overthrow it. In a similar way, McCaw plans
to buy some $ 30 million worth of Steinbrecher machines to carry through
its cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network. To be provided to 95 percent
of McCaw's regions by the end of 1995, CDPD is a data overlay of the existing
cellular system, which allows users of the current analog system to send
digital data at a rate of 19.2 kilobits per second, compared to the 9.6-kilobit-per-second
rate offered by most modems over twisted-pair wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher radio can survey any existing swath of spectrum in real
time and determine almost instantly which channels are in use and which
are free. It is this capability that convinced McCaw to buy Steinbrecher
data cells despite the commitment of McCaw's putative owner, AT&amp;T, to
sell narrowband units made by Cirrus Logics' subsidiary Pacific Communications
Sciences Inc. (PCSI), which have to scan through channels one at a time.
McCaw is using the Steinbrecher radios as sniffers that constantly survey
the cellular band and direct data bursts to those channels that are not
being used at a particular time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the immediate needs of the marketplace alone justify the adoption
of Steinbrecher data cells. With modems and antennas increasingly available
and even moving sometime next year to PCMCIA slots the size of a credit
card, demand for wireless data is likely to soar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PCSI is now shipping a quintuple-threat communicator that fits into the
floppy bay of an advanced IBM ThinkPad notebook or an Apple PowerBook, enabling
them to send and receive faxes, make wireless or wire-line phone calls,
dispatch data files across the existing cellular network or send CDPD packets
at 19.2 kilobits per second. Speech recognition capabilities from IBM and
Dragon Systems will come next year to personal digital assistants, permitting
them to read or receive E-mail by voice. Although the first Newtons and
Zoomers have disappointed their sponsors, the market will ignite over the
next two years as vendors adopt the essential form factor of a digital cellular
phone with computer functions rather than providing a kluge computer with
a vaporware phone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, McCaw has more on its mind with Steinbrecher than merely gaining
a second source for CDPD sniffers. By simultaneously purchasing some 10
percent of the company and putting chief technical officer Nicholas Kauser
on the Steinbrecher board, McCaw is signaling not a tactical move but a
major strategic thrust. The Steinbrecher rollout in fact represents McCaw's
stealth deployment of broadband digital capability.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the rival CDPD equipment from PCSI, Hughes and AT&T all can be made
to perform CDPD communications as an overly to the existing cellular phone
system. However, only the Steinbrecher systems can be upgraded to perform
all of the functions of a base station and more, for voice, data and video.
Only Steinbrecher allows the replacement of 416 radio transceivers, one
for each channel, with one broadband radio and some digital signal processing
chips. Only Steinbrecher can replace a $ 1.5 million, 1,000 square foot
cellular base station with a box the size of a briefcase costing some $
100,000 but, thanks to Moore's Law, racing toward $ 10,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen only whether McCaw will have the guts to follow through
on this initiative by completely rebuilding its network to accommodate the
wideband radio being installed at its heart. Self-cannibalization is the
rule of success in information technology. Intel and Microsoft, for example,
lead the way in constantly attacking their own products. But this mode of
life is deeply alien to the telephone business--even an entrepreneurial
outfit like McCaw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With new software and a simple upgrade to a MiniCell, the Steinbrecher DataCell
will allow the McCaw system to handle all modulation schemes simultaneously--AMPS,
TDMA, CDMA and future methods such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access--obviating the need for hybrid phones. The multiprotocol and aerobatic
capabilities of broadband digital radios could enable McCaw to roll out
a cornucopia of PCS services--for everything from monitoring vending machines
or remote power stations to tracking tracks and packages, and linking laptops
and PDAs--while the rest of the industry is still paralyzed by wrangles
over incumbent users, regulatory procedures, frequency access and radio
standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Making channel sizes a variable rather than a fixed function of radios,
Steinbrecher systems offer the possibility of bandwidth on demand. They
could open up the entire spectrum as one gigantic broadband pipe into which
we would be able to insert packets in any empty space--dark fiber in the
air. 
<PRE>
<B>So Stop The Auction</B></PRE>
<BR>
So what does this have to do with the impending spectrum auction? Almost
everything. Strictly speaking, the FCC is leasing 10 year exclusive rights
to radiate electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies to deliver PCS.
This entire auction concept is tied to thousands of exclusive frequency
licenses. It has no place for broadband radios that treat all frequencies
alike and offer bandwidth on demand. It has no place for modulation schemes
that do not need exclusive spectrum space. Continuing to use interference
standards based on analog transmissions that are affected by every passing
spray of radiation, FCC rules fail to grasp the far more robust nature of
digital on-off codes with error correction. By the time the FCC gets around
to selling its 1,500 shards of air, the air will have been radically changed
by new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum. You buy or
lease spectrum as you would a spread of land. Once you have your license,
you can use it any way you want as long as you don't unduly disturb the
neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher system, by contrast, suggests a model not of a beach but
of an ocean. You can no more lease electromagnetic waves than you can lease
ocean waves. Enabled by new technology, this new model is suitable for an
information superhighway in the sky. You can use the spectrum as much as
you want as long as you don't collide with anyone else or pollute it with
high-powered noise or other nuisances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Steinbrecher model, you employ the spectrum as you use any public
right of way. You are responsible for keeping your eyes open and avoiding
others. You cannot just buy a 10 year lease and then barge blindly all over
the air in a high-powered vessel, depending on the government to keep everyone
else off your territory and out of your way. The spectrum is no longer dark.
The Steinbrecher broadband radio supplies you with lights as you travel
the information superhighway. You can see other travelers and avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if Steinbrecher radios did not exist, however, the assumptions of the
auction are collapsing in the face of innovations by Qualcomm and other
spread-spectrum companies. Like Steinbrecher radios, CDMA modulation schemes
allow you to use spectrum without interfering with others. To auditors without
the code, calls seem indistinguishable from noise. But radios with the code
can dig up signals from under the noise floor. Up to the point of traffic
congestion where the quality of the signal begins to degrade gracefully,
numerous users can employ the same frequencies at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This property of CDMA has been tested in Qualcomm's CDMA Omnitracs position
locator and two-way communications system. Mainly used by trucking companies,
it is now being extended to cars, boats, trains and other mobile equipment.
Based on geosynchronous satellites, it operates all across the country,
with some 60,000 units, under a secondary license that forbids Qualcomm
to interfere with the primary license-holders of the same frequencies. Qualcomm's
transceivers on the tops of trucks use a small antenna that issues a beam
six to 10 degrees in width. Because satellites are just two degrees apart,
the Qualcomm beam can blanket several satellites. Other users, however,
are entirely unconscious of the presence of the CDMA signal. Omnitracs has
operated for some six years and has not interfered with anyone yet. 
<PRE>
<B>No More Blind Drivers On The Information Superhighway</B></PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing array of low-interference technologies available, the
FCC should not give exclusive rights to anyone. Instead, it should impose
a heavy burden of proof on any service providers with blind or high-powered
systems that maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license,
that want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.
In particular, the FCC should make all the proponents of TDMA, whether in
the American or European GSM systems, explain why the government should
wall off spectrum. The wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth
on demand and send their packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm and Steinbrecher also radically attack
the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the auction is based. Steinbrecher's
radio makes it possible to manufacture new spectrum nearly at will. By putting
one of his MiniCells on every telephone pole and down every alley and in
every elevator shaft, the cellular industry can exponentially multiply the
total number of calls it can handle. At some $ 100,000 apiece and dropping
in price, these MiniCells can operate at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz
just as well as at the two-gigahertz range being auctioned by the government.
It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning off beachfront property, with a long
list of codicils and regulations and restrictive covenants, while the tide
pours in around him and creates new surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, the wideband capability
of the Steinbrecher radio joins CDMA in allowing the use of huge spans of
spectrum that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The Steinbrecher radio
can survey the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services,
UHF television and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions.
For example, the prime territory between 225 megahertz and 400 megahertz,
consisting of some 3,0130 25-kilohertz channels, is entirely occupied by
government and air force communications. But most of the channels are largely
unused. A Steinbrecher radio could sit on those frequencies and direct calls
to empty slots.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An ideal system would combine Steinbrecher broadband machines with Qualcomm's
modulation schemes. Steinbrecher supplies the lights and eyes to find space
in already licensed spectrum bands; CDMA allows the noninvasive entry Into
spans of spectrum that are in active use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Steinbrecher system changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot;
or rental. Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, Steinbrecher
radios can reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any
unoccupied territory. As Steinbrecher radios become the dominant technology,
the notion of spectrum assignments allotted in 2,500 specific shards becomes
a technological absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street is beginning to catch on. When Steinbrecher announced in January
a private placement through Alex. Brown, the company wanted to raise some
$ 20 million. The response was overwhelming, and hundreds of frustrated
Investors were left wringing their hands as the new radio left the station.
The sole proprietorship of the mid-1980s with revenues of $ 5 million or
less was moving into sleek new headquarters off Route 198 in Burlington.
Steinbrecher Corp. was becoming yet another of the Moore's Law monsters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the issue for Washington emerges starkly. Do we want a strategy
for MiniCells or for Minitels?

The perennial question of all suitors of fate and fortune now whispers and
resounds through conference resorts, executive retreats and consulting sessions
across the land as business leaders from Hollywood to Wall Street pose with
pundits and ponder the new world of converging technologies. Symbolized
in a famous mandala by MIT's Media Lab, this grand fondue of information
tools_to be served la carte on a flat-panel screen_is foreseen to be a $3.5
trillion feast for American business sometime early next century. Few would
guess that crucial to the emerging mediamorphosis_as king of the flat panel_will
be a slight, graying, bearded man with some 30 teddy bears, Roger Fidler.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler coined the term mediamorphosis as the title of his forthcoming book.
His office in Boulder, Colo., looks out on the panorama of a picturesque
downtown of red brick and neo-Gothic, surrounded by the Rocky Mountain foothills
and sepia sandstone buildings of a mile-high Silicon Valley. Down the hall
is an Apple Computer media center which is developing graphical forms of
AppleLink, the company's on-line network. Down the block is Cablelabs, John
Malone's research arm, which is designing the future of the cable industry.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Fidler, though, is a newspaperman, a veteran of some 32 years in a
business little known for technology. Beginning as an 11-year-old paperboy
in Eugene, Oreg., Fidler went on to serve as a reporter, science columnist
and art director before launching what is now Knight-Ridder Tribune Graphics.
A multimillion-dollar business and reliable profit center, this venture
provides digital graphics for newspapers and video animations for TV stations
across the country over a dedicated network called PressLink, also launched
by Fidler. Now Fidler and his allies working in Knight-Ridder's Information
Design Laboratory are concocting an audacious plan to make the lowly newspaper
the spearhead of the information economy.<BR>
<BR>
Most information companies and executives are betting on him to fail. Barry
Diller, the former ruler of 20th Century Fox, recently circled the planet
of technology on a celebrated pilgrimage from Hollywood to find where the
money would be made in the new information economy. Shunning Fidler's little
lab, he arrived at nearby Cablelabs and resolved on home shopping through
cable TV. He bought into QVC for some $20 million and went into business
with John Malone. After a more corporate investigation, featuring polls
and customer surveys, Robert Allen of AT&T settled to a remarkable degree
on the $14 billion market in electronic games. Since launching an alliance
with Sega, AT&T has been collecting game companies as compulsively as your
kid collects games. It has bought shares of Sierra Online, 3DO, Spectrum
HoloByte and PF Magic.<BR>
<BR>
Moving toward the news trade is IBM. But rather than collaborating with
one of the thousands of newspapers that use its equipment, the computer
giant is trysting with General Electric's NBC in a kind of elephants' waltz
into the sunset of old broadcast media.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these leaders in the new gold rush toward multimedia are getting
it wrong. Fixated by market surveys that map demand for existing video,
they are plunging down dead ends and cul-de-sacs with their eyes firmly
focused on the luminous visions in their rearview mirrors. Blockbuster,
Nintendo and other game and video vendors have good businesses, for the
moment, but they are ballast from the past.

News In The Microcosm

</B></PRE>
The leader who best comprehends the promise of the next phase in information
technology may be Fidler of Knight-Ridder. A student of electronic technology,
he has grasped an amazing and rather obscure fact: of all the information
providers, only newspapers are fully in tune with the law of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the constant rise in the computing power of individual microchips
relative to systems of chips, the law of the microcosm dictates that power
will continually devolve from centralized institutions, bureaucracies, computer
architectures and databases into distributed systems. On the most obvious
level, it caused the fall of the mainframe computer and the companies that
depended upon it, and assured the ascent of personal computers and workstations.
In the next decade, the law of the microcosm will assure the displacement
of analog television, with its centralized networks and broadcast stations,
by computer networks with no center at all. While offering a cornucopia
of interactivity, computer networks can perform all the functions of TV.<BR>
<BR>
With the cost-effectiveness of chips still doubling every 18 months, the
law of the microcosm is not going away. Now it dictates that of all the
many rivals to harvest the fruits of the information revolution, newspapers
and magazines will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
The secret of the success of the newspaper, grasped by Roger Fidler, is
that it is in practice a personal medium, used very differently by each
customer. Newspapers rely on the intelligence of the reader. Although the
editors select and shape the matter to be delivered, readers choose, peruse,
sort, queue and quaff the news and advertising copy at their own pace and
volition.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, newspapers differ from television stations in much the way
automobiles differ from trains. With the train (and the TV), you go to the
station at the scheduled time and travel to the destinations determined
from above. With the car (and the newspaper), you get in and go pretty much
where you want when you want. Putting the decisionmaking power into the
hands of the reader, the newspaper accords with the microcosmic model far
better than TV does. Newspaper readers are not couch potatoes; they interact
with the product, shaping it to their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
Computers will soon blow away the broadcast television industry, but they
pose no such threat to newspapers. Indeed, the computer is a perfect complement
to the newspaper. It enables the existing news industry to deliver its product
in real time. It hugely increases the quantity of information that can be
made available, including archives, maps, charts and other supporting material.
It opens the way to upgrading the news with full-screen photographs and
videos. While hugely enhancing the richness and timeliness of the news,
however, it empowers readers to use the &quot;paper&quot; in the same way
they do today_to browse and select stories and advertisements at their own
time and pace.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, the expense of computers restricted this complementarity
to newsrooms and pressrooms. The news today is collected, edited, laid out
and prepared for the press by advanced digital equipment. Reporters capture
and remit their data in digital form. But the actual printing and distribution
of the paper remain in the hands of printers and truckers.<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm has reduced the price of personal computers
below the tag on a high-end TV and made them nearly coextensive with newspapers.
Newspapers and computers are converging, while computers and televisions
still represent radically different modes. It is the newspaper, therefore,
not the TV, that is best fitted for the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
Newspapers can be built on foundations of sand_the silicon and silica of
microchips and telecom. Not only does the computer industry generate nearly
three times the annual revenues of television but computer hardware sales
are growing some eight times faster than the sales of television sets. By
riding the tides of personal computer sales and usage, newspapers can shape
the future of multimedia.<BR>
<BR>
High-definition PC displays will benefit text far more than images. The
resolution of current NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) analog
television_62 dots per inch_is actually ample for most images, particularly
the studio-quality forms that can be converted for digital delivery over
fiber-optic lines. Even the conventional interlaced TV screen_in which alternate
lines are filled in every second_easily fools the eye for video. But for
fully readable text you need the 200 to 300 dots per inch of a laser printer
or super-high-resolution screen. Such screens are now being developed. Overkill
for most images, they could supply the first display tablets with screens
as readable as paper.

Fat Panel's Digital Newspaper

</B></PRE>
After the &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; panorama, the first thing you
see in Roger Fidler's office is a more modest tableau. At a round table
in the corner is a huge teddy bear he calls Fat Panel. Fat Panel is poised
to read a tablet that looks very much like a newspaper, but in fact is a
flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high and a half-inch thick.
Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your
local newspaper, this device_call it a newspanel_might contain a trove of
news, graphics, audio and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday
papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links, it might connect to databases
of news and entertainment from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of this tablet is something that looks a lot like the page of
a newspaper. It contains headlines for featured stories followed by their
first few paragraphs and a jump to an inner page. The jump, unlike that
in your usual newspaper, is electronic and immediate. You click an arrow
with a pen or a mouse_or in the near future, say the word_and the rest of
the story almost instantly appears. If your eyes are otherwise engaged,
you can click on an audio icon and have the story read aloud to you.<BR>
<BR>
Discreetly placed on the bottom of the panel are three sample ads. Since
ads currently supply some 80 percent of the revenues of many newspapers
and magazines, the entire system will rise and fall on the effectiveness
of the ads. However, electronics promises a more total revolution in advertising
than in any other facet of the newspaper outside of printing. This change
comes none too soon. As shown by a general drop in margins from 30 percent
in the mid-1980s to close to 10 percent last year, newspapers are suffering
a sharp decline in conventional advertising revenues, only partly compensated
for by an influx of funds from blow-in coupons and inserts.<BR>
<BR>
In a 1988 prophecy at the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., Fidler
envisaged electronic newspanel ads in the year 2000: &quot;When you touch
most ads, they suddenly come alive. More importantly, advertisers can deliver
a variety of targeted messages that can be matched to each personal profile.
An airline ad offering discount fares to South America attracts me with
the haunting music of an Andean flute. I'm planning to take some vacation
time in Peru next month [Fidler's wife is a Peruvian recording artist],
so I touch the ad to get more information. Before I quit, I'll check the
ad indexes to see if any other airlines are offering discount fares. With
the built-in communicator, I can even make my reservations directly from
the tablet if I choose. The airline's reservation telephone number is embedded
in the ad, and my credit card numbers and other essential data are maintained
in the tablet, so all I would have to do is write in the dates and times
that I want to travel and touch a button on the screen. The information
is encrypted as well as voice-print protected, so there is no risk of someone
else placing orders with my tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the usual notion, the electronic newspaper will be a far more
effective advertising medium than current newspapers, television or home
shopping schemes. Rather than trying to trick the reader into watching the
ad, the newspaper will merely present the ad in a part of the paper frequented
by likely customers. Viewers who are seriously interested in the advertised
item can click on it and open up a more detailed presentation, or they can
advertise their own desire to buy a product of particular specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In deference to Fidler, who currently combs the world looking for the best
flat-panel screens, Fat Panel appears to be perusing a story on field emission
displays (FEDs). Even cathode ray tubes with VGA graphics command only 72
dots per inch of resolution. This has been shown to slow down reading by
some 25 percent compared with paper. Readers of Voyager Co.'s tomes on Mac
PowerBooks quickly discover that even Susan Faludi's breezy Backlash or
Michael Crichton's compulsive Jurassic Park or James Gleick's normally riveting
biography of Richard Feynman bog down in subtle but insidious typographical
fuzz. A newspaper with more than one item on the screen would be worse.
The age of electronic text entirely depends on the development of screens
with the definition of a laser printer. For this purpose, FEDs offer great
long-term promise.<BR>
<BR>
While the prevailing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) merely reflect or channel
light, FEDs emit light like a cathode ray tube. Indeed, as currently envisaged
by a Micron Display Technology process, FEDs will array millions of tiny
cathode light emitters that allow bright displays with high resolution and
full-motion video. Although today's FEDs require too much power for full
portability with current battery technology, they represent an inviting
option for newspaper tablets at the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Usable tablets, however, will arrive long before then. At the August Siggraph
show, Xerox demonstrated a 13-inch-diagonal liquid crystal display with
a record 6.3 million pixels, delivering 279 dots per inch of resolution.
The 279 dots per inch provide some three times more definition than the
screen of a Sun workstation_the current desktop graphics workhorse_and negligibly
short of the 300-dot resolution of a laser printer.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond resolution, the key to the newspaper tablet is portability. Portability
means low power. Active-matrix LCDs are inherently a high-power, low-transmissive
medium. The crystals absorb light; the polarizer wastes half the light;
the transistors at each pixel squander power. For high contrast, backlighting
is essential. That sinks another 20 to 30 watts. The higher the resolution,
the worse all these problems become.
<PRE>


<B>


Full-Motion Images Or Full-Motion Users?

</B></PRE>
According to the Fidler vision, the U.S. should stop emulating the Japanese,
who boldly invested some $12 billion in manufacturing capacity for power-hungry
liquid crystal displays used on notebook computers and flat-screen TVs.
Urged by the Clinton administration, this U.S. industrial policy is based
on a strategy of &quot;catch up and copy,&quot; and it will fail. Rather
than chase the Japanese by achieving high resolution at high power to compete
with cathode ray tubes, the U.S. should target high resolution at low power
to compete with paper.<BR>
<BR>
As in semiconductor electronics, the winners will follow a strategy of low
and slow. The law of the microcosm ordains exponential performance gains
from slower and lower-powered transistors packed ever closer together on
individual microchips. Throughout the history of semiconductors_from the
first transistor to the latest microprocessor_the industry has succeeded
by following this law: replacing faster and higher-powered components with
smaller, slower and lower-powered devices. When you pack enough of the slow
and low transistors close enough together, your system may end up operating
faster than a supercomputer based on the highest-powered and fastest discrete
transistors. And it will definitely be more efficient in MIPS per dollar.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm has not been suspended for displays. The Japanese
have been focusing on high-powered screens capable of reproducing the features
of low-end CRTs: full-motion color video. Rather than favoring full-motion
video, however, the U.S. should foster full-motion readers through low-
powered and slow components. It is the people rather than the pixels that
should be able to move. Speed will come in due course.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrating the first prototype of such a system is Zvi Yaniv of Advanced
Technology Incubator (ATI) of Farmington Hills, Mich. Long among the most
inventive figures in America's eternally embryonic flat-panel industry,
Yaniv was a founder of Optical Imaging Systems, currently the leading U.S.-based
producer, with well under one-percent global market share.<BR>
<BR>
For his tablet, Yaniv uses a material invented at Kent State University
in Ohio called Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Texture (PSCT). On it he inscribes
pixels in the form of helical liquid crystal devices. The helices are chemically
doped to give them a specific reflectivity: showing all wavelengths or colors
of light that do not match the resonant wavelengths in the helix.<BR>
<BR>
So far ATI has demonstrated images in black and white and in 16 levels of
gray scale. Color, according to Yaniv, poses no theoretical problems. Based
on current experimental successes, it will be achieved within the next two
years. For the first newspanels, however, color is less important than the
high-resolution text capability, which ATI delivers at a breakthrough price.<BR>
<BR>
This technology offers four key advantages over the active-matrix LCD: no
transistors, no polarizers, no color filters, no backlighting. Without these
power-and space-hungry features, Yaniv's screens can achieve higher density
of pixels at far lower energy use. This adds up to far higher resolution
at milliwatts of power (rather than 20 watts) and at far higher manufacturing
yields, and thus far lower cost. Yaniv predicts screens with laser-printer
resolution and with contrast higher than paper, costing between $1 and $2
per square inch (compared with around $10 for current active-matrix devices).
That means 8-1/2-by-11-inch tablets for $100 to $200 in manufacturing cost,
well under Fidler's target price.<BR>
<BR>
Still an R&D project in an intensely competitive industry, ATI may not have
all the answers, but it points the way to a solution. Within the next three
or four years, a portable tablet with laser-printer resolution and contrast
and with hundreds of megabytes of solid-state or hard disk memory will be
purchasable for an acceptable price. Fat Panel's tablet is not merely a
toy; it is the token of a technology that will sweep the world.

News On The Net

</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, precusor solutions are being rolled out on personal computers,
Newtons, Zoomers and other personal digital assistants. Already collecting
and transmitting copy in digital form, reporters and editors could just
as well provide digital content to all the other platforms that are emerging
in the 1990s, from tiny portable personal communications services to supercomputer
knowledge bases.<BR>
<BR>
Also empowering the newspaper industry will be the exploding new world of
boundless bandwidth or communications power in both the atmosphere and the
fibersphere (see Forbes ASAP, December 7, 1992, and March 29, 1993). One
of the most difficult concepts for many business planners to grasp is the
onset of bandwidth abundance: the idea that the electromagnetic spectrum
is not scarce but nearly limitless. The text of a daily newspaper takes
up about a megabyte; a hundred or so black-and-white photographs take up
about 100 megabytes; 25 color photos could run another 100 megabytes, or
even a gigabyte, depending on resolution. Video clips would take about 100
megabytes apiece. With just 500 megabytes, you could throw in the entire
&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summing it all up, the total bit-cost of a paper, including video-rich ads,
might be comparable to that of a two-hour movie_perhaps two gigabytes with
compression. Two gigabytes can be transmitted in a second down fiber-optic
lines, in perhaps 10 seconds down a gigahertz cable connection, and in perhaps
a matter of three or four minutes down a twisted-pair copper line equipped
with Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) technology, Amati Corp.'s
amazing new phone-company access system. From Digital Equipment Corp. and
Zenith to Hybrid Technologies and Continental Cablevision, several firms
are demonstrating impressive ways to use cable lines for two-way digital
data transmission at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more, which would
fill up a two-gigabyte newspanel in just over three minutes. Electrical
power companies also are laying fiber along with their power lines. All
these pipes are little used for long hours of the night and could be employed
to deliver newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Complementing this web of wires will be wireless methods of delivery. Cellular
technology is moving toward a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol
that allows use of the entire spectrum every mile or so, and toward millimeter
wave frequencies that offer gigahertz of capacity. Again, access to these
systems might be expensive on a demand basis, but a newspaper can be sent
whenever space or time is available. Delivery of the basic paper through
wires and fiber and delivery of short updates and extras via the air would
be optimal. Whatever electronic or photonic techniques are used, the laws
of the microcosm and telecosm ordain that distribution of newspapers will
become vastly cheaper, more efficient and more timely than their present
methods: trucks and bicycles.
<PRE>


<B>


The &quot;Domonetics&quot; Of The Word

</B></PRE>
The future of newspapers will not depend on technology alone, however. The
ultimate strength of the &quot;press&quot; comes not from its machinery
but from its &quot;domonetics&quot;_a word that describes an institution's
cultural sources and effects.<BR>
<BR>
Judeo-Christian scripture declares that in the beginning was the word. There
is no mention of the image. Today in information technology, the word still
widely prevails. In 1992, trade publications, newspapers and magazines alone
generated some $73 billion in sales, compared with television revenues of
$57 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In general, images are valuable as an enhancement to words. As Robert Lucky
of Bellcore has pointed out, images are not in themselves usually an efficient
mode of communication. In his definitive work &quot;Silicon Dreams,&quot;
just released in a new paperback edition, Lucky writes that after an evening
of television, &quot;we sink into bed, bloated with pictorial bits, starved
for information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
People who gush that a picture is worth a thousand words usually fail to
point out that it may well take a million computer &quot;words&quot; to
send or store it. Written words are a form of compression that has evolved
over thousands of years of civilization. In a multimedia encyclopedia, such
as Microsoft's Encarta, some 10,000 images take up 90 percent of the bits,
but supply perhaps one-100th of the information. With the pictures alone,
the encyclopedia is nearly worthless; with the words alone, you still have
a valuable encyclopedia. Most of the work and the worth are in the words.
Supremely the masters of words, newspapers can add cosmetic pictures, sounds
and video clips far more easily than TV or game machines can add reporting
depth, expertise, research and cogent opinion.<BR>
<BR>
More profoundly, the domonetics of the new technologies strongly favors
text-based communications. Video is most effective in conveying shocks and
sensations and appealing to prurient interests of large miscellaneous audiences.
Images easily excel in blasting through to the glandular substrates of the
human community; there's nothing like a body naked or bloody or both to
arrest the eye and forestall the TV zapper.<BR>
<BR>
TV news succeeds because of timeliness and vividness. Compared with TV imagery,
news photos tend to be late and lame. Nonetheless, for all its power and
influence, broadcast television news is a dead medium, awaiting early burial
by newspapers using new technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The TV news problem is summed up by the two-minute rule_the usual requirement
that, short of earthquake or war, no story take more than two minutes to
tell. This rule even applies to the epitome of broadcast news_CNN. It is
entirely a negative rule. The reason for it is not that the audience desires
no more than two minutes of coverage of stories of interest. On any matter
deeply interesting to the viewer, two minutes is much too little.<BR>
<BR>
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that the viewer will not tolerate
more than two minutes of an unwanted story. Its only function is to forestall
the zapper, but its effect is to frustrate any viewer with more than a superficial
interest in a story. Increasingly it reduces TV news to a kaleidoscope of
shocks and sensations, portents and propaganda, gossip and titillation.<BR>
<BR>
The new technologies, however, put individual customers in command. Making
their own first choices among scores of thousands of possibilities, individuals
eschew the hair-trigger poise of the channel surfer. Narrowcasting allows
appeal to the special interests and ambitions, the hobbies and curiosities,
the career pursuits and learning needs of particular individuals. Thus,
the new media open up domonetic vistas entirely missed by mass media.<BR>
<BR>
At the domonetic elevation of newspapers, images are supplementary, not
primary. The new technologies thus favor text over pure video because text_enhanced
by graphics where needed_is by far the best (and digitally most efficient)
way to convey most information and ideas. Where graphics are overwhelmingly
more efficient than alphanumerics_as in visualization of huge bodies of
data or statistics_the newspanel can supply true computer graphics and simulations.
Interactivity, after all, is the computer's forte.

The $700 Million Incentive

</B></PRE>
As early as 1981, Fidler saw and predicted that computer technology using
flat-panel screens would allow the newspaper business to eliminate much
of its centralized manufacturing and printing plant and much of its distribution
expenses, and deliver the product directly to the customer at half the cost.
He saw that this process would jeopardize neither the branded identity nor
the editing functions nor the essential character of the paper. The distribution
of intelligence would simply permit the customer rather than the newspaper
to supply the display and the printer. This microcosmic shift would drastically
simplify and improve the accessibility and worth of the information, enhancing
the value of newspaper archives and other resources. This step could theoretically
save Fidler's employer, Knight-Ridder, some $700 million, or between half
and two-thirds of its current costs.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler's vision is just as promising for magazines. In effect, his concept
allows newspapers to combine the best features of daily journalism with
the best qualities of specialty magazines. The front pages and shallower
levels of the system will still function like a streamlined newspaper, which
readers can browse, search and explore as they do a conventional paper without
thrashing about through the pages. The deeper levels will function like
magazines, focusing on business, technology, lifestyles, sports, religion
or art. Indeed, to exalt their offerings into an ever richer cornucopia,
news systems will want to collaborate with magazines, just as they often
distribute magazines today with their Sunday papers.
<PRE>


<B>


The Soul Of The New Medium

</B></PRE>
In addition, electronic magazines can excel newspapers in providing a sense
of community through interaction with other readers and authors in new kinds
of dynamic letters, bulletin boards and classified sections. In a sense,
the news panel never ends. Beyond its offering of news, articles and archives,
it opens into new dimensions of interactivity.<BR>
<BR>
As Stephen Case puts it: &quot;Everybody will become information providers
as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities
that marry information and communications_thereby creating an interactive,
participatory medium. This community aspect is crucial--it is the soul of
the new medium.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most practical current vessel for this expansion of the press is Case's
own company, America Online, a supplier of an icon-based interface and gateway
to scores of &quot;infobases&quot; and bulletin boards in Vienna, Va., outside
the District of Columbia. Ten percent owned by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
eight percent controlled by Apple, allied with Knight-Ridder and providing
access to such journals as the New Republic, National Geographic, Time and
Macworld, America Online has uniquely focused on the vital center of the
new market: the point of convergence of newspapers, magazines and computers
in new communities of interest and interaction.<BR>
<BR>
Following this strategy, America Online has invested just $20 million (one-100th
the capital of Prodigy) and devoted half the time, to achieve nearly one-third
the customer base and generate strong profits, in contrast to huge estimated
losses on the part of IBM and Sears. Prodigy is now paying AOL the high
tribute of imitation, making deals with Cox Enterprises Inc. and its 17
newspapers, and with Times-Mirror. Perhaps most audacious in pursuing this
vision, however, is Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., which recently purchased
Delphi Internet Services Corp., the only on-line service with full Internet
access to home PC users. Delphi already offers an array of news programs
and special-interest conferences, including a popular computer news show
led by moderator Jerry Pournelle that provides interactive dialogs on everything
from abstruse computer features to science fiction. Pournelle and some 300
other conference moderators can function like editors in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
Internet is the global agglomeration of data networks that has emerged from
the original Pentagon research network called ARPANET. Growing at some 15
percent a month for several years to a current level of 10 to 20 million
users, Internet has bifurcated into linked commercial and research nonprofit
divisions. As John Evans, president of News Corp.'s Electronic Data, puts
it, explaining the Delphi purchase: &quot;Internet is like a giant jellyfish.
You can't step on it. You can't go around it. You've got to go through it.&quot;
Delphi now plans to go through it using much quicker access systems, including
cable.<BR>
<BR>
Evans declares that these new collaborations between News Corp. and Internet
will &quot;put the 'me' back into media.&quot; His concept, also shared
by Nicholas Negroponte's Media Lab and Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator,
is an automated news database ultimately supplying the customer with a personal
paper filtered from floods of daily information by an agent programmed to
pursue your own interests. In Fidler's view, however, these digital papers
will succeed only to the extent that they transcend this vision of the Daily
Me.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler prefers the vision of a Daily Us, shaped by human editors rather
than by electronic agents or filters. According to Fidler, the law of the
microcosm will put so much intelligence and storage in the tablet that the
individual can personalize the &quot;paper&quot; every day in a different
way. If, as Case puts it, the soul of the new medium is community, the reader
will want to begin in a particular context, a specially favored &quot;place&quot;
in the world of information, a place with a brand name and identity: a newspaper.

The Computer Imperative

</B></PRE>
Above all, the key to the special advantage of newspapers in the new era
is their great good fortune in being forced to focus on computers. It should
be evident by now to everyone in the information business that the energy,
the creativity, the drive, the gusto, the pulse, the catalyst of this industry
is computers. The magic is in the microcosm of solid-state electronics (doubling
the density of components on a chip every 18 months) and in the concentric
circles of enterprise and invention that surge outward from this creative
core: the some 5,000 software firms, the thousands of manufacturers of chips,
peripherals, printed circuit boards and add-on cards; the double-digit annual
expansion in the armies of computer scientists and software engineers; the
ever growing millions of PC owners devoting their creative energies and
passions to this intoxicating machine.<BR>
<BR>
What the Model T was to the industrial era-the teenage training board, the
tinkerer's love and laboratory, the technological epitome-the PC is to the
Information Age. Just as people who rode the wave of automobile technology-from
tiremakers to fast-food franchisers-prevailed in the industrial era, so
the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer
community will predominate in the information era.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, are so many apparently ambitious and visionary executives shrinking
from the central arena to play around on the fringes with TVs and game machines?
Why are American computer executives standing silently aside while the so-called
U.S. Grand Alliance for the Future of Advanced Television, so-called digital
HDTV, adopts an interlaced screen technology that is fundamentally hostile
to computers?<BR>
<BR>
For images, the human eye cannot tell the difference between interlaced
and progressively scanned displays. But interlace poses endless problems
for text and multimedia. Apart from Zenith, the American leaders in the
Grand Alliance are AT&amp;T, General Instrument Corp., MIT, Sarnoff Laboratories
and GE-NBC. All but MIT capitulated to pressure from foreign TV interests
such as Sony, Thomson Corp. and Philips Electronics to betray the American
computer and newspaper industries by adopting a display scheme unsuited
for the multimedia and text programs central to the next computer revolution.<BR>
<BR>
Without text and multimedia capabilities, high-resolution images can open
virtually no markets not already served by current &quot;digitally enhanced&quot;
improved-definition television displays. Limiting the teleconferencing market,
for example, is not the resolution of the screens but the bandwidth of the
network. Without computer capabilities, digital TV is likely to be a large
disappointment.<BR>
<BR>
Claiming to set a standard that can survive deep into the next century,
the Grand Alliance is focusing on short-term economies for manufacturing
TVs tomorrow. These executives are all missing the point and the promise
of the era in which they live. The Information Age is not chiefly about
kicks and thrills, offering games for kids and so-called dildonics for &quot;adults.&quot;
Markets for educational programs and on-line information services are already
growing much faster than game markets. In 1992 in the computer business,
according to the Software Publishers Association, entertainment software
revenues rose some 29 percent to a level of $342 million. Educational software
for the home rose some 47 percent to $146 million. Meanwhile, sales of computers
with modems are rising at about 1,000 percent a year, hugely faster than
the sales of TVs. Online services like America Online and Prodigy have been
growing almost 500 percent per year since 1988. According to current projections
based on microprocessor CPU sales, some 50 million PCs may be sold over
the next 12 months, and perhaps three-quarters of them will contain either
on-board modems or networking systems.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate reason that the newspapers will prevail in the Information
Age is that they are better than anyone else at collecting, editing, filtering
and presenting real information, and they are allying with the computer
juggernaut to do it. The newspapers are pursuing the fastest expanding current
markets rather than rearview markets. They are targeting adults with real
interests and ambitions that generate buying power rather than distracting
children from more edifying pursuits. In the computer age, follow the microcosm
and you will find the money, too.

</H3>
The world of networks breaks into two polar paradigms. Most familiar is
the Public Switched Telephone Network. From the tiniest transistor flip-flop
on a modem chip through labyrinthine layers of rising complexity on up to
a 4ESS supercomputer switch linking 107,520 telephone trunk lines (itself
consisting of millions of interconnected transistors), the public network
is a vast, deterministic web of wires and switches. Once you are connected
in the public network, your message is guaranteed to get through.<BR>
<BR>
In the public network, bandwidth constantly expands as you rise in the hierarchy.
At the bottom are the twisted-pair copper wires of your telephone that function
at four kilohertz (thousands of cycles per second). At the top are fiber-optic
trunk lines that function at rates close to the 2.9-gigahertz speeds of
the electronic transistors that feed the glass wires. In The Geodesic Network,
writer Peter Huber has described the five tiers of the telephone switching
system as a structure with &quot;the solidity, permanence and inflexibility
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, which on paper it resembled.&quot; Although
the pyramid has suffered erosion and change in recent years, it remains
mostly in place today: the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
That is one network paradigm. The other paradigm is Robert Metcalfe's. It
germinated in his mind in 1970 as he read a paper by Norman Abramson of
the University of Hawaii given at a computer conference that year. Abramson
told of another paradigm. He called it Aloha. With Aloha, there were no
guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
AlohaNet was a packet radio system used for data communications among the
Hawaiian Islands. Packets are collections of bits led by a header, which
is a smaller collection of bits, bearing an address; they proceed through
a communications system rather like envelopes through a postal system. The
key feature of AlohaNet was that anyone could send packets to anyone else
at any time. You just began transmitting. If you didn't get an acknowledgment
back, you knew the message had failed to get through. Presumably your packets
had collided with others. In Metcalfe's words, &quot;They were lost in the
ether.&quot; At that point, you would simply wait a random period (to avoid
a repeat collision as both parties returned to the channel at once). Then
you would retransmit your message.<BR>
<BR>
To Metcalfe, AlohaNet seemed a beautifully simple network. But Abramson
showed that, because of collisions and other problems, it could exploit
only 17 percent of its potential capacity. A student of computer science
searching for thesis ideas, Metcalfe believed that by using a form of advanced
mathematics called queuing theory he could drastically improve the performance
of AlohaNet without damaging its essential elegance and simplicity. What
Metcalfe, then a graduate student at Harvard, eventually discovered would
bring such networks up toward 90 percent of capacity and make the Aloha
concept a serious threat to the entire structure of the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's discovery is known as Ethernet. Twenty years later, Ethernet
is the world's dominant local area network and, at 47, Metcalfe is known
and celebrated as its inventor. He was also founder in 1981 of 3Com Corp.
of Santa Clara, Calif., the leading producer of Ethernet adapter cards and
a major communications products company. In this era of networking, he is
the author of what I will call Metcalfe's law of the telecosm, showing the
magic of interconnections: connect any number, &quot;n,&quot; of machines
- whether computers, phones or even cars - and you get &quot;n&quot; squared
potential value. Think of phones without networks or cars without roads.
Conversely, imagine the benefits of linking up tens of millions of computers
and sense the exponential power of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the power of the telecosm reproduces on a larger scale - by interconnecting
computers - the exponential yield of the microcosm, a law describing the
near magical effect of interconnecting transistors on chips of silicon:
As increasing numbers of transistors are packed ever closer together, the
transistors run faster, cooler, cheaper and better. Metcalfe's law suggests
that a similar spiral of gains is available in the telecosm of computer
communications.<BR>
<BR>
Already the world economy is beginning to reap these gains. Ethernet now
links more than half of the world's 40 million networked computers, extending
Metcalfe's paradigm and his law. Indeed, the law would suggest that in addition
to his some $20 million of personal net worth from 3Com, Metcalfe's concept
has fostered scores of billions of dollars in global wealth. Led by Novell
Inc., with an equity capitalization of more than $8 billion, the top 15
publicly traded computer networking companies have a total market value
of some $22 billion. Add to that sum the productivity value derived from
the world's 100 million computers as they are increasingly linked in networks,
and you may sense the power of the Metcalfe paradigm.<BR>
<BR>
Today, 20 years after Metcalfe conceived it at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, Ethernet is still gathering momentum, gaining market share and generating
innovations. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of America's computers
on LANs rose from less than 10 to more than 60, and most of these gains
were in Ethernets.

Ether Moves to Cable
</B></PRE>
The telecosm's powers could end up saving the American economy from itself.
In an era when the new payroll taxes and regulations of Clintonomics could
end up driving millions of mind workers back into their homes, Digital Equipment
Corp. is now extending Ethernet's range from its current two-mile limit
to some 70 miles. Called Channelworks, the DEC system can run Ethernet on
the some 50 million miles of cable television coax. This will enable potential
scores of millions of telecommuters to access their familiar office LAN,
tap their company E-mail and their corporate databases, and generally make
themselves feel at work while at home. Deployed at a profit and extended
to customers at a flat monthly rate, Ethernet in the neighborhood could
become a massive growth business for the cable industry over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
As Ethernet spreads and faces the challenge of remote work teams using digital
images, simulations, maps, computer-assisted design schematics, visualizations,
high-fidelity sounds and other exotic forms of data, the system is constantly
adapting. From 3Com spin-offs Grand Junction Networks and LAN Media Corp.
to smart hubmaker David Systems, from Kalpana to Synernetics, from National
Semiconductor to Hewlett Packard, from Cabletron to SynOptics, from AT&T even
to Token Ring leader IBM, scores of companies are pushing Ethernet into
new functions and performance levels. It is emerging in full-duplex, multimedia,
fast, fiber- optic, shielded, unshielded, twisted, thin, thick, hubbed,
collapsed, vertebrate, invertebrate, baseband, broadband, pair, quartet,
coaxial and wireless versions. It now can run at 2.9, 10, 20 and 100 megabits
per second. It has moved from 2.9 megabits per second to 100 megabits per
second and from a few hundred to several million users in some 10 years.
At its present pace of progress, Ethernet will someday run isochronous (real-time)
gigabits per second on linguine.

Aloha ATM, Gushing Cash
</B></PRE>
So why is its boyish-looking inventor - over Metcalfe's anguished protests,
think of Ted Kennedy some 10 years ago - giving up on his baby just as it
enters its roaring 20s? Why is he ready to abandon his basic paradigm in
favor of a return to the public network vision of massive, intelligent switching
systems? Why is he now talking of Ethernet as a &quot;legacy LAN&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Discoursing this summer from a deck chair on his yacht (a converted lobster
boat) as he breezed down from his Maine retreat to a dock on the Charles
River for his 25th MIT reunion, Metcalfe has the air of an elder statesman.
Though humbly grateful for the benisons of Ethernet, he has seen the future
in a poll of experts prophesying the universal triumph of a powerful new
switching system called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). &quot;I have found,&quot;
Metcalfe solemnly intones, &quot;an amazing consensus among both telephone
industry and computer networking experts that ATM is the future of LANs.&quot;
Aloha, ATM.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe is not alone among Ethernet pioneers flocking back to Ma Bell's
pyramid of switches. Also leaving Ethernet behind is his onetime nemesis,
Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA, a leading guru of gigabit networks who helped
define the mathematical limits of Ethernet, and is given credit (or is it
blame?) for naming its Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
protocol (CSMA/CD). Preparing to defect to ATM is Ronald Schmidt, the brilliantly
ebullient technical director of SynOptics, who created the latest Ethernet
rage - sending the signals over telephone wire under the 10baseT standard
(10 megabits of baseband data over twisted pair).<BR>
<BR>
There has not been such a stampede to a new standard since the global rush
to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the early 1980s. Offering
digital phone lines at 144 kilobits per second, ISDN is just now coming
on-line in time to be aced by the megabits per second of Ethernet over cable.<BR>
<BR>
In a prophetic memo launching the concept in 1973, Metcalfe foreshadowed
the secret of Ethernet's success. He wrote: &quot;While we may end up using
coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise
to talk in terms of an ether, rather than `the cable'.... Who knows what
other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network: maybe
radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring, or frequency-multiplexed cable
TV or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof. The essential
feature of our medium - the ether - is that it carries transmissions, propagates
bits to all stations.&quot; In other words, it is the stations, rather than
the network, that have to sort out and &quot;switch&quot; the messages.<BR>
<BR>
The word Ethernet may be capitalized to signify the official standard of
CSMA/CD. Or it may be lowercased to suggest a medium without switches, routers
and other intelligence. In either case, the word &quot;ether&quot; conveys
the essence of the ethernet. An ether is a passive, omnipresent, homogeneous
medium. Long believed essential for the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
the literal existence of an ether was disproven in the late 19th century
by the famous experiments of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. But the
concept of a figurative ether - a dumb medium of propagation - survives
in modern communications.<BR>
<BR>
The enduring magic of ethernets stems from the law of the microcosm, favoring
distributed terminals over centralized hierarchies, peer networks of PCs
over mainframe pyramids. The microcosm's relentless price/performance gains
on chips have endowed Metcalfe's peer-to-peer scheme with ever more powerful
peers, at ever lower prices. Medium-independent from the outset, the Metcalfe
systems do not require central switching. In an ethernet system the intelligence
is entirely in the terminals, not in the network itself, and most of the
bandwidth is local (where some 80 percent of traffic resides).<BR>
<BR>
Although this ATM is expected to gush jackpots of cash for gaggles of network
companies and investors, it is unrelated to its acronymic twin, automatic
teller machines. Think of ATM rather as an automated postal center that
takes messages (of any size or addressing scheme), chops them up, puts them
into standardized little envelopes and figures the best routes to their
destinations in billionths of a second. The magic of ATM comes from restricting
its services to those uniform envelopes (called cells) of 53 bytes apiece
(including a five-byte address) and creating for each envelope what is called
a virtual circuit through the network. These features make it unnecessary
for intermediate switches in the network to check the address; the cell
flashes through the system on a precomputed course.<BR>
<BR>
A compromise defined by phone companies as the longest packet size that
can handle voice in real time, 53-byte cells are also short enough to be
entirely routed and switched in cheap hardware; i.e., microchips. This means
that the ATM postal center can function at speeds of up to 155 megabits
per second or even higher. Perhaps most attractive of all, ATM can handle
multimedia data, such as digital movies or teleconferences, with voice,
text and video that must arrive together at the same time in perfect sync.
As the world moves toward multimedia, the industry is flocking toward ATM,
the innovation that can make it possible. 
<PRE><B>


Ethernet: A Legacy LAN?
</B></PRE>
By contrast, Ethernet seems old and slow: the vacuum tube of computer communications.
Think of it, crudely, as a system where all the messages are cast into the
ocean and picked up by terminals on the beach which scan the tides for letters
addressed to them. Obviously, this system would work only if the beach terminals
could suck up and filter tremendous quantities of sea water. The magic of
ethernet comes from the ever growing power of computer terminals. The microcosm
supplies sufficiently powerful filtering chips - chiefly digital signal
processors improving their powers some tenfold every two years - to sort
mail and messages in the vasty deep. This is quite a trick. To the experts,
it seems unlikely to prevail for long against the fabulously swift switching
of ATM.<BR>
<BR>
True, there is some confusion about just how, where and when this miracle
cure will arrive. The industry's leading intellectual, Robert Lucky of Bellcore
- a paragon of long- distance networks - predicts that ATM will come first
in local area networks, while Metcalfe, of local area network fame, thinks
it will come first in wide area networks. James Chiddix of Time- Warner
Cable is probably right in predicting digital cable pay- per-view as the
first big ATM customer, using it for broadcasting films in his 500-channel
digital cable TV project in Orlando. But most experts agree that one way
or another ATM will blow away Ethernet during the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as usual, conventional wisdom is wrong. Ethernet is quietly
preparing for a new era of hegemony in the marketplace for computer connections.<BR>
<BR>
The reason Ethernet prevailed in the first place is that, in the words of
Ronald Schmidt, &quot;it was incredibly simple and elegant and robust.&quot;
In other words, it is cheap and simple for the user. Customers can preserve
their installed base of equipment while the network companies innovate with
new transmission media. When the network moves to new kinds of copper wires
or from one mode of fiber optics to another, Ethernet still looks essentially
the same to the computers attached to it. Most of the processing - connecting
the user to the network, sensing a carrier frequency on the wire and detecting
collisions - can be done on one Ethernet controller chip that costs a few
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe described the conception of this technology in 1981, &quot;I
explored the advantages of moving the transceiver down out of the ceiling
onto the adapter board in the host computer. I had seen many actual Ethernet
installations in which our brick transceivers were not up in the ceiling
tapping into the ether cable, as they were supposed to be...but instead
were on floors behind computers, dropped in the centers of neatly coiled
transceiver cables.... We were discovering that the people buying personal
computers and workstations in those days were not generally the same kind
of people who were allowed to remove ceiling tiles and string cables through
conduits.... The personal computer revolution was taking place in organizations
from the bottom up.... It was time for Ethernet to be re- invented for bottom-up
proliferation among the personal computer work group revolutionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using &quot;silicon compiler&quot; design tools to radically reduce the
time to market, Seeq Technology created an Ethernet chip for PCs in time
for a single-board version of the interface unit. Putting the transceiver
on the adapter board eliminated a special transceiver cable and drastically
simplified the system. There is no bulky connection between the coding device
preparing information for the network and the transceiver sending or receiving
the signals on the net. All this processing is done in the computer, on
one printed circuit board, now reduced to the size of a credit card. While
its rival from IBM - Token Ring - requires a mostly proprietary array of
token-passing managers, clocking assignments and other complexities, Ethernet
is an open system. Relative to the alternatives, it offers the possibility
of something near plug-and-play. So advantaged, Ethernet has overcome IBM's
Token Ring, 20 million nodes to 8 million in installed base.<BR>
<BR>
But this does not persuade Ethernet pioneers Bob Metcalfe, Leonard Kleinrock
and Ronald Schmidt. Because ATM can handle all kinds of data fast, Metcalfe
sees it as the &quot;grand unifier&quot; bringing together WANs and LANs
and effecting a convergence of television, telephony and computing in turbulent
multimedia bit streams bursting into our lives early next century. &quot;And
of all the variations of multimedia,&quot; he writes in Infoworld - Metcalfe
is now its publisher - &quot;the one that will drive ATM is personal computer
video conferencing - interactive, two-way, real-time, integrated digital
voice, video and data.&quot; Although Ethernet will persist as a &quot;legacy
LAN,&quot; he says, it cannot compete with ATM in these crucial new roles.
Schmidt makes the same essential case, stressing the need for switch-based
architectures in a world of exotic new media. 
<PRE>
<B>

Kleinrock's Formula
</B></PRE>
Why the pessimism on Ethernet? Bringing mathematics to bear on the argument,
Kleinrock declares that the collision-detecting functions of Ethernet bog
down with large bandwidths, short packets and long distances. Thus, the
system must fail with the onset of fiber highways across the land. The oceans
of Ethernet will simply grow too large to allow efficient detection of collisions
in its depths. With large bandwidths, more packets can be pumped into the
wire or glass before a collision is detected; by that time, most of the
transmission is finished. When the distances get too long, collisions can
occur far from the transmitting computer and take longer to be detected.
The shorter the packets, the worse these problems become.<BR>
<BR>
As Kleinrock computes these factors, the efficiency of Ethernet is roughly
a function (a), computed as five times the length of the line in kilometers
times the capacity of the system in megabits per second, divided by the
packet size in bits. When a exceeds a certain level (Kleinrock sets it at
0.05), Ethernet's efficiency plummets.<BR>
<BR>
With ATM packet sizes needed for voice traffic - or even at the minimum
Ethernet packet size of 72 bytes - any Ethernet with a capacity much higher
than 10 megabits per second exceeds this tipping point. Therefore, high-speed
Ethernets must either use packets too long for voice or shrink in extent
to far less than three kilometers. This is what Howard Charney's Grand Junction
and its rival LAN Media propose with Fast Ethernet. Noticing that 10baseT
hubs have reduced the length of Ethernet connections by a factor of 10,
Ron Crane, founder of LAN Media, suggests that this change allows acceleration
of the system by an equal amount: to 100 megabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
But this seems a one-time fix that fails to address the multigigabit world
of fiber optics. At some point, Kleinrock, Schmidt and Metcalfe agree, ad
hoc fixes will begin to fail and ATM (or possibly some other system) will
begin to prevail. Using Kleinrock's formula, that point is here today, with
100-megabit- per-second Ethernet lines.<BR>
<BR>
As an increasing share of network traffic takes the form of pictures, sounds,
simulations, three-dimensional visualizations, collaborative work sessions,
video teleconferences and high- resolution medical images, the Ethernet
model already seems to be foundering, according to many expert projections.
The triumph of ATM, so it would seem, is just a matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
Time, however, is precisely what is absent from all these projections. Ethernet
is a system based on the intelligence of terminals; ATM is a system based
on the intelligence of switches and networks. All the arguments for ATM
miss the law of the microcosm: the near annual doubling of chip densities,
the spiraling increase of computer power surging on the fringes of all networks
as transistor sizes plummet over the next decade. 
<PRE>
<B>

The Power of Exponents
</B></PRE>
Amazingly, most technology prophets fail to come to terms with the power
of exponents. You double anything annually for long - whether deforestation
in ecological nightmares or transistors on silicon in the awesome routine
of microchip progress - and you soon can ignite a sudden moment of metamorphosis:
a denuded world or a silicon brain.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the year 2000, semiconductor companies will begin manufacturing
microchips with more than a billion transistors on them - first as memories,
and soon after as processors. A billion transistors could accommodate the
central processing units of 1,000 Sun workstations or 16 Cray supercomputers.
This means roughly a millionfold rise in the cost-effectiveness of computing
hardware over the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Intelligence in terminals is a substitute for intelligence in networks;
switching and routing functions migrate from the center of the web to the
increasingly powerful computers on its fringe. Looming intelligence on the
edge of the network will relieve all the current problems attributed to
ethernets and will render the neatly calculated optimizations of ATM irrelevant.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the law of the telecosm is launching a similar spiral of performance
in transmission media, ultimately increasing their bandwidth, also by a
factor of millions. Bandwidth is a replacement for switches. If you can
put enough detailed addressing, routing, prioritization and other information
on the packets, you don't have to worry about channeling the data through
ATM switches. The emergence of dumb, passive all-optical networks with bandwidths
some ten- thousandfold larger than existing fiber optics will obviate much
of the pressure on switches. Combining microcosm and telecosm in explosive
convergence makes it nothing short of ridiculous to expect a system optimized
for 1995 chip densities and fiber capacities to remain optimal in 2013,
when Metcalfe foresees the final triumph of ATM, or even in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, ATM will be useful in various applications before then. Sun and
SynOptics envisage putting ATM ports in future workstations where ISDN ports
mostly languish today. AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Wiltel will incorporate
ATM switches in their long- distance networks. Time-Warner may indeed use
them for distributing movies. In general, however, companies that rely on
an apparent trend toward centralized switches will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Cable firms will do better by sticking to the ethernet paradigm of dumb
bandwidth that has made them the envy of all in the emerging era of digital
video. IBM and other computer firms with powerful ethernet and fiber technologies
should not rush to adopt the public network paradigm. Telephone companies
in particular should maintain an acute interest in their ongoing experiments
with all-optical networks and other passive optical technologies. Any near-term
successes of ATM, afflicted with the many glitches and growing pains of
any new technology, are likely to come too slowly to deflect the continuing
onrush of ethernets.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet prevails because it is dumb. In the old world of dumb terminals
- whether phones, IBM displays or boob tubes - a network had to be smart.
There was time even to put human operators into the loop, and a need to
concentrate programming at one central location. But in the emerging world
of supercomputers in your pocket or living room, networks will have to be
dumb bandwidth pipes. What the coming array of desktop supercomputers and
cheap massively parallel servers will need is passive dark fiber, mostly
unlit by switching intelligence. Dark fiber can allow for the huge variety
of data forms and functions, protocols and modulation schemes that is emerging
in the new era of convergence between phones and computers.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet is the protocol for a dumb pipe, a passive ether. That is why it
fits so well on a cable TV line and why it will fit even into the multigigabit
world of a multimedia future. 
<PRE><B>


The Return of Aloha
</B></PRE>
The dumb networks of the fibersphere will be ethernets. These all-optical
links that have been made possible by the creation of erbium-doped amplifiers
and other passive devices give access to the full 25,000-gigahertz bandwidth
of fiber optics (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; December 7, 1992).
In these networks, fiber changes from a substitute for copper to a substitute
for air. Just as the microcosm put entire computer systems on single slivers
of silicon, the telecosm will put entire communications systems on seamless
webs of silica. Terminals will tune into the infrared colors of the fibersphere
like radios tuning into the frequencies of AM or FM.<BR>
<BR>
As chips and fiber are hugely expanding their performance and bandwidth,
information traffic is rapidly migrating from the wires to the air. Although
many experts contend that the radio frequencies in the air - the electromagnetic
spectrum - are running out, communications systems now use only a tiny sliver
of spectrum, well under one percent of the usable span. As shown by Cellular
Vision's success in sending cable TV signals over the air at 28 gigahertz,
it is now possible to move up the spectrum into the vast domains of microwaves;
other experiments show that network traffic in these portions of the spectrum
can be accommodated with error rates of less than one in a billion, enough
to avoid extensive error correcting.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the replacement of today's 30-mile cells with tomorrow's
closely packed microcells means an exponential rise in available spectrum
and an exponential reduction in power usage. The replacement of analog systems
with digital systems using code division multiple access (CDMA) will allow
the reuse of all frequencies in every cell, thus further expanding available
spectrum (see &quot;New Rules of Wireless,&quot; March 29, 1993). A company
called ArrayCom in Santa Clara, Calif., is developing a new system, called
spatial division multiple access (SDMA), based on smart antennas that can
follow an individual communicator as it moves through a cell. This technology
would allow the use of all the available spectrum by each &quot;phone.&quot;
<PRE>
<B>

Back to the Real &quot;Ether&quot; Net
</B></PRE>
Inspired by a radio network, ethernet is well adapted for this new world
of wireless. The increasing movement of data communications into the air
- the real ether - will give new life to Metcalfe's media-independent system.
Cellular systems already operate with protocols similar to CSMA/CD. As microcells
fill up with digital wireless traffic, all networks will increasingly resemble
the most popular computer networks. In the ether, links will resemble ethernets
far more than ATMs.<BR>
<BR>
The coming age of bandwidth abundance in glass and in air converges with
an era of supercomputer powers in the sand of microchips. We should build
our systems of the future - the cathedrals of the Information Age - on this
foundation of sand. It will not disappoint us.<BR>

Whether in glass or in air, the basic protection of Ethernet is not smarts
but statistics. Ethernet is a probabilistic system. This fact has caused
endless confusion. Because a probabilistic system cannot guarantee delivery
of data on a specific schedule, or at all, many experts have concluded that
Ethernet is unsuited for critical functions, or for isochronous data inherent
in multimedia - with voice and video that must arrive in real time. When
and whether anything arrives is a stochastic matter.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, if there is enough bandwidth for the application, ethernets
work just as reliably and well as their deterministic rivals, even for advanced
video traffic. As Kleinrock observes, for many image applications, very
long packets can be as effective as very short ones. The long packets become
a virtual circuit connection, somewhat like a phone call. It is likely that
perhaps 80 percent of all multimedia will be sent in burst mode, with a
store-and-forward protocol, rather than isochronously in real time. Broadband
ethernets will be better for burst mode than ATM's short packets.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, the combination of intelligence at the terminals and statistics
in the network is more robust than the mechanistic reliability of Token
Rings or ATM switches. As Metcalfe points out in explaining the triumph
of his vision over Token Ring, Ethernet is a simple system that is stabilized
by its own failures. The CSMA/CD algorithm uses collision detection in a
negative feedback loop that delays retransmission in exponential proportion
to the number of collisions, which is a reliable index of the level of traffic.
Thus thriving on a worst- case assumption of frequent failure, Ethernet
has outpaced all rivals that guarantee perfect performance and depend on
it.

Metcalfe's Law: Transcending His Own Doubts
</B></PRE>
Now, in ATM, Ethernet is faced with a new paragon of determinism offering
high speeds and rigorous guarantees, a new version of the public network
paradigm, a new pyramid of switching power. But Metcalfe's law and legacy
may well win again, in spite of his own defection.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe explains, &quot;Ethernet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;
The same could be said of all the devices of the microcosm and telecosm.
Both of the supreme sciences that sustain computer and communications technology
- quantum theory and information theory - are based on probabilistic rather
than deterministic models. They offer the underpinnings for an age of individual
freedom and entrepreneurial creativity.<BR>
<BR>
Humankind's constant search for deterministic assurance defies the ascendant
science of the era, which finds nature itself as probabilistic. To Einstein's
disappointment, God apparently does throw dice. But chance is the measure
of human ignorance and the mark of divine knowledge. Chance thus is the
paradoxical root of both fate and freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Nations and networks can win by shunning determinism and finding stability
in a constant shuffle of collisions and contentions in ever expanding arenas
of liberty.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an acceptance of setbacks, capitalist markets are more robust
than socialist systems that plan for perfection. In the same way, successful
people and companies have more failures than failures do. The successes
use their faults and collisions as sources of new knowledge. Companies that
try to banish chance by relying on market research and focus groups do less
well than companies that freely make mistakes and learn from them.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an ability to absorb shocks, stochastic systems in general are
more stable than deterministic ones. Listening to the technology, we find
that ethernets resonate to the deepest hymns and harmonies of our age.

</H3>
<HR>In the spring of 1989 when Michael Bookey first visited the Middle School
in Issaquah, Wash., to help the school system with its computers, he was
reminded of his early ventures into Communist China. After 20 years of working
with computer networks, to enter Issaquah seemed to me like encountering
an exotic tribe of primitives untouched by the modern world.<BR>
<BR>
The only sign of modern technology was a forlorn computer room full of Radio
Shack TRS-80 machines, most of which had broken down. Then he learned that
as a remedy for this problem, the district had recently voted a levy of
$2.7 million for outlays on high technology.<BR>
<BR>
Lacking any better ideas, the school system had decided to distribute the
money equally among the teachers, to spend as they wanted. What they wanted
turned out to be VCRs, incompatible CD- ROM drives and a random selection
of computers, printers and other gear to be scattered through the schools
under the influence of a flock of computer salespeople attracted to the
site by the pool of mandated money.<BR>
<BR>
To Bookey, this remedy seemed worse than the disease. It meant that the
bulk of the money would be wasted, further estranging both taxpayers and
students from the most powerful technologies of their era. Bookey wanted
school officials to know that the most powerful technology is not computers,
but computers joined in networks.<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the magic of networks, Bookey asks you to imagine a car plumped
down in the jungle. Checking it out, you might find it a very useful piece
of equipment indeed. A multipurpose wonder, it would supply lights, bedding,
radio communications, tape player, heat, air conditioning, a shield against
arrows and bullets, and a loud horn to frighten away fierce animals. In
awe of the features of this machine, you might never realize that the real
magic of a car comes in conjunction with asphalt.<BR>
<BR>
For the first 10 years of the personal computer era, according to Bookey,
we have used our computers like cars in the jungle. We have plumbed their
powers for processing words and numbers. All too often, home computers have
ended up in the closet unused. We have often failed to recognize that most
of the magic of computing stems from the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, the interconnections come on individual chips, as ever
smaller transistors crammed ever closer together work faster, cooler and
cheaper, enhancing both the capability and the speed of the processor. The
microcosm strewed some 100 million personal computers around the world and
endowed individuals at workstations with the creative power of factory owners
of the Industrial Age.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the microcosm generates exponential gains from increasing connections
on chips, the telecosm generates exponential gains by increasing connections
between chips, powerful microcomputers in themselves. These links between
increasingly potent microchips will soon dominate the world of communications.<BR>
<BR>
The networking industry therefore faces a drastic transition from a people-to-people
regime to computer-to-computer. This change is so radical that it resembles
a mutation that creates a new species. People communicate in domains of
time and space entirely alien to the world of computers. To a person, a
one- second delay on a voice line seems hardly noticeable; to a computer,
one second may mean a billion computations that would take hundreds of human
lifetimes to accomplish by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, people can transmit or receive only a small stream of information
at a time. They want relatively narrow bandwidth connections for a relatively
long period, a 64-kilobit- per-second voice link, for example, for a 10-minute
phone call.<BR>
<BR>
Computers, on the other hand, can handle hundreds of millions or even billions
of bits a second. They often need many millions of bits of bandwidth for
a short time fractions of seconds. As industry shifts from a human scale
of time and space to a computer scale, the systems and structures in existing
telephone and broadcast networks become almost irrelevant. Essentially,
all other forms of networks: voice, text, video and sound, are rapidly giving
way to various new forms of multimedia computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Driving this overwhelming force of change is the alchemy of interconnections,
working in the telecosm with the same logic and feedback loops as connections
in the microcosm. hile dumb terminals such as phones and TVs use up bandwidth
without giving anything back, computers are contributors to bandwidth, not
consumers of it.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the more computers, the more bandwidth. Not only is the network
a resource for each new computer attached to it, but each new computer is
also a resource for the network. Each new computer expands the potential
switching and processing capacity of the system by a large multiple of the
increasing demands it makes on other switches and processors.<BR>
<BR>
As ever more powerful computers are linked ever more closely, whether in
digital cellular microcells or in webs of fiber and coaxial cable, usable
bandwidth expands explosively. Governing the expansion of networks, the
law of the telecosm is just as potent as the law of the microcosm. Indeed,
in enhancing the productivity of organizations, the telecosm consummates
the microcosmic miracle.

Microsoft Windows for Jungle Cars</B></PRE>
The creator in the early 1970s of what may have been the world's first fully
functioning system of corporate electronic mail, Bookey was quick to foresee
this radical shift from person- to-person to computer-to-computer communications.
Pursuing his vision of networks, Bookey in 1982 spurned a possible job at
Microsoft on the grounds that the company was outfitting cars for the jungle,
a decision that probably cost him several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he joined Seafirst Bank in Seattle, where he made history (in the
form of a reference in John Sculley's autobiography, Odyssey) by pushing
the purchase of a thousand Macintosh computers for bank networks at a crucial
time for Apple.<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 Bookey left the bank to join Doelz Co., a startup in Irvine, Calif.,
that built advanced computer network equipment that he had used at Seafirst.
For Doelz, Bookey designed software and spearheaded marketing. A so-called
cell-based network, the Doelz system broke up a stream of data into short,
equal-sized packets, each with its own address, to be sent through the nodes
of the net in nanoseconds, like letters accelerated a trillionfold through
the branches of the post office.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey was not necessarily wrong in choosing this technology over Microsoft's.
In the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems, this essential
approach, based on short, uniform packets that can be switched at gigabit
speeds in hardware, is now the rage of planners in the computer networking
industry.<BR>
<BR>
ATM is seen as the crucial enabler for digital networks combining voice,
data and video in so-called multimedia applications. Bill Gates now calls
multimedia the future of his industry. Although many observers still see
ATM as a futuristic technology, Bookey believes its future is nearly now.
From the humblest personal digital phone to the most advanced supercomputer,
computer-to-computer links will dominate the entire universe of telecommunications,
and ATM will dominate network switching.<BR>
<BR>
Doelz, however, was ahead of its time and failed to survive a tangled legal
imbroglio with AT&T in 1988. So Bookey took a big profit on his California
residence and returned with his wife Robin and daughter Erin to Seattle,
where he had grown up and set records in the mile on the track at the University
of Washington. He bought his dream house on the top of Cougar Mountain in
Issaquah, with a view of the very Twin Peaks made famous in the television
series and put out his shingle as a network consultant under the name Digital
Network Architects (DNA). Almost as an afterthought, the Bookeys sent Erin
to Issaquah Middle School.<BR>
<BR>
Having designed networks around the world, Bookey had often seen their powerful
impact on business organizations, such as banks. Bookey believed that networks
could have a similar revitalizing impact on schools. Like banks, schools
are essentially information systems that have brought their Industrial Age
hierarchy into the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Creating networks in schools, however, posed many special problems. Most
school systems, like Issaquah, were largely unaccustomed to managing technology.
The system would need to create a large MIS (management information services)
organization just to keep the network functioning. Then, as the teachers
at Issaquah hastened to point out to Bookey, there was the problem of students.
Impulsive, mischievous and messy, they in no way resembled the disciplined
employees of a corporation. Speaking from grim experience, some of the teachers
told Bookey that his network plans would succeed only if the computers were
reserved exclusively for teachers and if students were barred entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey, however, thought there had to be a way to bring the magic of networks
to America's increasingly troubled school systems. The secret would be to
recognize that, just as computers are not consumers of but contributors
to bandwidth, students should be seen not as a problem, but as a precious
resource in launching the networks that inform the Information Age.

Networks as Productivity Engines</B></PRE>
Ever since Adam Smith first maintained that the division of labor, the spread
of specialization, is the catalyst of the wealth of nations, economists
have seen the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and specialties as
the driver of efficiency and growth. The key force expanding specialization
in the contemporary capitalist economy is networks. Indeed, networks, by
their nature and purpose, refine the division of labor.<BR>
<BR>
In the financial industry, for example, networks allowed the proliferation
of specialized institutions. In the ever-shifting kaleidoscopes of American
finance, some institutions went local, some global. Some managed car loans,
credit cards or other consumer services; some handled mortgages, mutual
funds or real estate trusts; still others stressed computer leases, junk
bonds, venture capital or large corporate accounts.<BR>
<BR>
The pell-mell fragmentation of American finance during the 1980s into an
ever more refined division of labor enabled the U.S. to lead the world in
levels of capital efficiency, with more economic growth per dollar of savings
than any other country. Each financial business did not have to repeat all
the work of all the rest, and each became more efficient at a particular
task.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey believes that networks can have a similar effect on that other great
information-processing industry: education. Why should every school have
an all-purpose library and a French teacher and a calculus scholar and a
health center and an administrative office? Why should every school have
an entire complement of buildings?<BR>
<BR>
With all the schools on networks, individual schools could specialize in
particular subjects, functions and resources, as financial companies do.
Education would not have to happen exclusively, or even mostly, in schools.
The explosive spread of networks is now the prime mover of the U.S. economy,
allowing all industries to break down into patterns of specialization unbound
by place and time. And now the government wants to get into the act.

Superhighways in the Sky</B></PRE>
Zoom through tax-hike tollgates and glide out onto data superhighways; this
is the new mantra of American industrial policy. Add the further fillip
of investment for educational infrastructure and you can sweep up the ramp
toward the federal treasury and drive out with a bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
In this new era of the big bands, there are now some 10 bills before Congress
to foster vast new networks with large bandwidth, or communications capacity.
Some $2 billion has already been authorized and $765 million appropriated
this year for various programs related to a National Research and Educational
Network (NREN).<BR>
<BR>
Candidate Bill Clinton presented the concept of NREN as Ra national information
network to link every home, business, lab, classroom and library by the
year 2015. President Bill Clinton, vice-president Albert Gore and a raft
of advisors all celebrate the highway as the metaphor for the future information
economy. Gore points out that his father was a leader in building the Interstate
Highway System in the early 1950s; Albert Jr., wants to play a key role
in building the information highways of the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, data superhighways would seem to be the fulfillment of the fibersphere;
the way to create the vast new infrastructure of fiber-optic lines that
will bring the full promise of digital video and multimedia communications
to all citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, is Mike Bookey so worried? He would seem to be the perfect NREN
champion. Bookey has pursued networks through most of his career and now
is focusing on networks for education. In explaining the importance of computer
connections, he has even long used Gore's favored highway metaphor. Bookey
thinks that the federal superhighwaymen do not grasp the nature of networks
and how they grow. In systems work we have a rule: You design top down,
but you build bottom up.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey sees the creation of networks as an organic process, driven by public
demand, shaped by human needs and rooted in a moral universe of growth through
sharing. It is the experience of building the network that creates the expertise
to maintain and use it. In all these processes, big government is nearly
irrelevant.

None of the Above</B></PRE>
For the past 10 years, Washington, D.C. experts have been wringing their
hands over the supposedly unbearable costs of building broadband networks
and the urgent need for large federal funding. Analysts have been ruminating
over the question of who would spearhead the creation of broadband nets;
the phone companies, the cable television companies or the government.<BR>
<BR>
Before any of these forces could act, however, it became clear that the
answer would be none of the above. The hardest part of the job was accomplished,
with astonishing speed, by computer and networking companies. The rest of
the work is well under way, as cable and phone companies adopt the computer
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
As recently as 1989, only seven percent of America's personal computers
were connected to local area networks. By 1991 45 percent were connected,
and by 1993, close to two-thirds were linked to LANs. Growing even faster
than LANs is the internetworking business: the interconnection of existing
local area nets in wide area networks.<BR>
<BR>
Building internetworking gear or accessories, such companies as Cisco Systems,
Cabletron, Wellfleet, 3Com and SynOptics are among the highest flyers in
the technology stock market boom. Cisco, for example, is growing some 50
percent a year and commands a market value of almost $6 billion, comparable
to that of Digital Equipment Corp. Cabletron has hiked its revenues some
16-fold in the last five years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these connections run at some 10 megabits per second, enough for
high-resolution digital video, but inadequate for the more exotic traffic
in images predicted for use later in the decade. Increasingly, however,
the connections are fiber- optic lines or are broadband coax, which is nearly
as good as fiber for short-distance transport. The potential of fiber is
almost unlimited (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; Forbes ASAP, December
7, 1992).<BR>
<BR>
Although moving more slowly than the computer firms, telephone and cable
companies are rushing to lay fiber ever deeper into the nation's neighborhoods.
Spending some $2 billion (as much as NREN), Telecommunications Inc. (TCI)
vows, according to CEO John Malone, to have 90 percent of its subscriber
households served by fiber to the curb by 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing fiber into the local loop at a slower pace, the telephone companies,
led by Bell Atlantic, also are forging ahead with ingenious new ways to
make their twisted-pair copper connections carry as much as six megabits
per second of digital information. Wireless technology is also moving into
the local loop for video delivery (see &quot;The New Rule of Wireless,&quot;
Forbes ASAP, March 29, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. networking industry is not in need of fixing. The U.S. currently
commands some three-fourths of all the world's LANs and perhaps 85 percent
of its internetworks. Although Gore and others justify their industrial
policies by referring to the imperious plans of Japan, the U.S. currently
commands about three times the computer power per capita as Japan, some
10 times as many computers attached to networks, and an installed base of
broadband fiber and cable nearly 10 times as large. The remarkable thing
is that the U.S. government is so eager to fix a fabulously flourishing
system that is the envy of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The electronic and photonic networking industries actually resemble highways
in only the most superficial way. The highway construction trade has not
advanced substantially in 50 years. By contrast, the networking trade is
the fastest-moving part of the ever-accelerating computer industry and doubles
its cost- effectiveness every year. Although interconnecting government
laboratories, contractors and supercomputer centers with fiber is desirable,
a massive government network is not. Issaquah offers better guidance for
the future.... But first it will be necessary to deal with the abiding menace
of the student problem.

Overcoming the Student Problem</B></PRE>
&quot;What do you think you are doing? Answer me,&quot; the voice insisted
with the I've-got-you-squirming-now confidence of a teacher who has caught
a pupil red-handed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just lookin' around,&quot; grumbled Lee Dumas, the red-headed 13-
year-old, trying to sound natural. Glimpsing a telltale red screen of network
management among the array of blue displays used in the keyboarding class,
the teacher had walked up silently behind Dumas as he broke into the student
lists, software programs and grades, and was on the verge of entering the
administrative server.<BR>
<BR>
Dumas was a bad kid. No one at Maywood Middle School (one of the 16 campuses
in Issaquah) doubted that. His teachers called him &quot;obnoxious&quot;
or even &quot;brain-dead.&quot; He set what he believes was an all-time
record at Maywood by being detained after class some 60 times for insubordination.
Using the approved psychobabble, he says, &quot;I had problems with authority.
I couldn't accept teachers ordering me around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After being caught breaking into the computer system, Dumas was dragged
up to the principal's office. Neither the teacher nor the principal could
figure out the nature of the crime or judge its seriousness. For help, they
summoned Don Robertson, the administrator assigned to Issaquah's Technology
Information Project (TIP). He considered the situation gravely and recommended
severe punishment. Toward the end of the meeting, however, he turned to
Dumas and said, &quot;With your talent, you should become the sheriff rather
than the outlaw. Why don't you come down and join TIP?&quot; Since no one
had previously detected any talent in Dumas, this comment made a sharp impression.<BR>
<BR>
About a week later, he showed up sheepishly at Robertson's door. To school
administrators, kids like Dumas might be a problem, but to Bookey, Issaquah's
9,000 students seemed a wonderfully cheap resource. By training the students
to build and maintain the networks, he could make the $2.7 million the foundation
of an enduring educational resource.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the Issaquah network was almost entirely built by students between
the ages of 12 and 17. Using students to solve the problems of network maintenance
and support and thus reduce the real costs by some 80 percent was Mike Bookey's
solution to the perplexing problem of computers in schools.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the Issaquah networking venture, in the spring of 1990,
cost no money and arose from pure necessity. Just as in businesses across
the country, the initial motive for networking was the arrival of laser
printers from Hewlett Packard. Bookey began by giving his 10-person TIP
team a pile of manuals and having them install a basic network connecting
two PCs, an Apple II and a Macintosh to a laser printer. This step enhanced
the value of all the computers at a small fraction of the cost of buying
new dot-matrix printers for each. Four of the ten students managed to cobble
together the network in about a month. They learned the intricacies of pulling
twisted-pair wiring for 10baseT Ethernet computer connections running at
the standard rate of 10 million bits (megabits) per second.<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to add a hard disk containing school files and software
programs. Using both Apples and IBM PCs, the Issaquah network from the beginning,
had to handle a variety of communications protocols. If the network was
to connect to anything outside itself to the school's administration building
or the school system's libraries, for example, Issaquah would have to install
equipment that could sort out messages from different computers. This meant
Issaquah joined the market for multiprotocol routers. A router is a device
that sits on a computer network and reads the addresses on all the message
packets that pass by. If the address is on another network with a different
protocol, the router creates a new envelope for the packet and sends it
to the other network.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with all their routers and Ethernet wiring, the Issaquah networks
slowed to a crawl as soon as they had to connect outside a building. There,
they had to depend on what is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network,
where everything turns to analog and drowses down to some 2,400 bits per
second.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey demonstrated that the school could save money on its voice communications
by buying a digital T-1 line that multiplexes 24 phone circuits onto a 1.544-megabit-per-second
system. Since 12 of the 24 circuits would be enough to satisfy the school's
internal voice needs, the rest of the T-1 line, some 760 kilobits per second,
could be devoted to the data communications needs created by the school's
new Ethernets. Thus, while getting a cheaper solution for its voice traffic,
the school increased its data bandwidth by some sevenfold for free.<BR>
<BR>
Once these connections were in place, the students acquired a Microsoft
Mail program to incorporate E-mail in the system. Soon, this became the
heart of the network, with both students and teachers using it constantly
to handle papers, consult teachers in other schools in the system, make
reports to the state and interact with parents and students. E-mail became
so central to the functioning of Issaquah that when the computers were down
teachers would talk of canceling classes.<BR>
<BR>
To E-mail were added connections to Internet, the global research and education
network launched some 33 years ago as DARPA Net (the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency). Since Internet was civilianized in 1983,
adopting the TCP/IP networking standard, it has been expanding its traffic
at a pace of some 15 percent per month. Between 1981 and 1992 the number
of computers connected to Internet rose from 281 to 1.1 million. Through
Internet, the students could search through a variety of databases for material
for a paper or connect to Japan for help in learning Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Along with several other Issaquah students, Aaron Woodman, Jr., a burly
boy with his long blonde hair in a ponytail, became so adept at using Internet
that he now gives speeches to national conferences on the subject. The speechmaking
needs that grew out of the Issaquah project have imparted valuable lessons
in English communications for the students.<BR>
<BR>
All these developments did not occur without administrative resistance.
But the administration eventually became a prime beneficiary. Soon, the
computer networks in the Issaquah system were connected by a T-1 line to
the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative (WSIPC) 20 miles
north in Redmond, where attendance and other student records were kept for
the entire state.<BR>
<BR>
To make these WSIPC services more readily available to schools across the
state, Bookey proposed the creation of a statewide educational network running
on T-3 lines (45 megabits per second), now known as WEDNET. This provides
links all over Washington, from Shaw Island and Stehekin to Seattle and
Issaquah, with a rogue line down to Portland, Oreg.<BR>
<BR>
As for Lee Dumas, according to his mother, his situation has changed completely,
&quot;both in his attitude toward school and in the school's attitude toward
him.&quot; After joining TIP, Dumas became one of its most active and enthusiastic
members. Last summer, he got a job at the Computer Store in Seattle teaching
the Macintosh HyperCard program to a student body consisting, yes, of public
school teachers. According to Dumas, they had no problem accepting his authority
as a fledgling computer guru.<BR>
<BR>
No longer one of the outlaws, Dumas became an official beta tester for the
new Microsoft DOS 6.0 and Windows NT operating systems, specializing in
their security procedures. Following the path of another student who found
the &quot;Issaquah bug&quot; in Microsoft's LAN Manager program, Dumas believes
he found three or four bugs in NT.<BR>
<BR>
Having just finished his sophomore year, Dumas has gone to work this summer
at Microsoft for the company's network development chief, Brian Valentine,
who regards this once brain- dead punk as a valued employee with high promise
for the future. This student who floundered in the usual educational system
flourished when his individual specialization was discovered. The Issaquah
economy released his energies, just as the national economy releases its
own energies through the specialization and division of labor in computer
networks.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are millions of Lee Dumases in the schools of America, many
of them being given up for lost by analysts such as Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, because they are not adept at the usual curriculum for &quot;symbolic
analysts,&quot; Dumas' redemption by technology bears crucial lessons. The
lessons are Bookey's: Students are a resource, not a rabble; specialized
practical experience is more edifying than most textbook learning; networks
are the critical technology both for economic growth and for educational
renewal.<BR>
<BR>
To these insights should be added Lewis Perelman's view, in his book &quot;School's
Out&quot; (1992, Morrow), that teachers should increasingly abandon their
role as a &quot;sage on the stage&quot; in favor of service as a &quot;guide
on the side,&quot; steering their students through a global cornucopia of
educational resources. 
<PRE>


<B>


Education as a Network Driver</B></PRE>
It may seem peculiar that Bookey, a network guru for large corporations
like U.S. West, should focus his attentions on such problems as interconnecting
school children in Issaquah with libraries in Bellevue, parents on Squaw
Mountain, teachers across town and administrators at the Washington State
Information Processing Cooperative. Yet Bookey believes that the educational
application may well drive the creation of a true national infrastructure
of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The networking problems of schools closely resemble the networking problems
of a nation full of diverse systems. To achieve their full promise, school
networks must link computers of many varieties owned by parents, students
and teachers, to administrative servers owned by state and local governments,
to printers, libraries and databases. School networks must connect LANs
to IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture) links, to a variety of telephone
technologies, from T-1 lines of 1.5 megabits per second to T-3 lines at
45 megabits per second and, soon, to ATM switches and other potential gigabit
systems. In all its dimensions, including an acute financial constraint,
this challenge is altogether as difficult as interconnecting supercomputers
over fiber in an NREN.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey relished this challenge at Issaquah. Advocates of NREN might disparage
Issaquah as a relatively low-grade network. After all, it currently has
no fiber outside of the fiber links in the telephone network that it uses.
Without fiber, the network will not be able to accommodate collaborative
learning in multimedia forms across the country. Bookey demurs. Buying a
fiber-optic network before personal computer technology can manage broadband
flows of data is premature. In five years, fiber-optic links will probably
cost about one-fifth of what they cost today. When the network is needed,
Issaquah will be able to purchase it and, more important, also use it. Moreover,
TCI recently offered to install fiber throughout the Issaquah school system
for nothing as part of its general program of fiber to the curb.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that big-band technology will come to Issaquah in due course,
with or without NREN money. Critics, of course, will carp that Issaquah
is a special case &quot;a relatively rich community&quot; that could afford
to levy $2.7 million for technology. Yet the Issaquah example is galvanizing
schools across the state of Washington and even in California and Arkansas,
where Bookey and his colleague Mason Conner have been consulting with education
officials. Emulating Issaquah, other districts in Washington have since
raised some $140 million for network ventures. 
<PRE>


<B>


Glass Ceiling for Networks?</B></PRE>
The lesson of Issaquah is that data highways and superhighways, driven by
the convergence of microcosm and telecosm, are indeed emerging in America,
and at an astonishing pace. They already are revitalizing the economy and
society, and are helping to reform the system of education. The only federal
initiatives that will significantly assist the process are lower taxes,
accommodation of Internet growth and use, and further deregulation of telecommunications.
Communication must begin locally, with access to the community. From these
local roots can emerge the great branching systems that can interconnect
an information economy.<BR>
<BR>
By starting from the top, the government risks paving over the pullulating
fabric of networking enterprise with a glass ceiling of expensive and misplaced
fiber. In 1993 an estimated 37 million personal computers will be sold worldwide.
The same forces that impelled the networks of Issaquah will drive the owners
of these new PCs to interconnect them to other networks and will induce
the owners of the networks to link them together.<BR>
<BR>
As the centrifugal force of the microcosm, multiplying and distributing
intelligence through the world, converges with the integrating power of
the telecosm, the exponential miracles of specialization and growth will
gain new momentum. How far can this spiral reach? Internet will soon approach
some interesting limits. According to International Data Group, the number
of users has risen from 9,800 in 1986, all in the United States, to 4.7
million around the world today.<BR>
<BR>
At this pace, Internet will embrace the entire world population by the year
2001. That's one limit. As the system's trunking backbone rises to 45 megabits
per second on T-3 lines and above, the sky is the limit for the amount of
message traffic. In the first month after the enlargement to T-3 lines in
October 1992, usage rose from 3.5 trillion bytes to 4 trillion bytes. All
these networks are dominated by text and still pictures. But the miracles
of Internet and Issaquah are about to be joined with a new miracle of growth
in digital video connections in the local loop. 
<PRE>


<B>


Bombshell from Time-Warner</B></PRE>
How soon can this happen? Advocates of NREN speak of this technology being
consummated in 2015. But to most politicians and businessmen, a projected
date more than five years ahead is essentially a synonym for never-never
land; a way of saying, &quot;Forget about it. I'll be retired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that a widespread system of two-way broadband networks reaching
most American homes, schools and offices is less than five years away. All
U.S. business planners must come to terms with this transforming reality.
Announcements this spring from leading cable, telephone and computer companies;
from TCI and U.S. West to IBM and Silicon Graphics; bring the shape of this
network into clear focus.<BR>
<BR>
Exemplary among plans announced by a variety of firms is Time-Warner's projected
system in Orlando. As described by Jim Chiddix, the company's college-dropout
technical guru, the Time- Warner showcase venture will be a giant client/server
computer network, suggestive of the arrangements now ubiquitous in corporate
computing. The wires will be a combination of fiber to the curb and coax
to the home. Much of the system's hardware and software will be supplied
by computer companies (allegedly including IBM and Silicon Graphics). The
&quot;client&quot; computers will be digitized TVs or teleputers linked
to powerful database computers that use a parallel-processing architecture
to access hierarchical memory systems, from DRAM caches to optical disk
archives. These memories will contain terabytes (trillions of bytes) of
digital video movies, games, educational software and other programming.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most dramatic breakthrough, though, will come in the switches.
While much of the computer and telephone world continues to dither about
the future of ATM (many consigning it to the pits of 2015), Time-Warner
is committed to installing ATM switches, built by AT&amp;T, beginning next
year in Orlando. The ATM system will allow Time-Warner to offer telephone,
teleputer and multimedia services together, as soon as the regulators allow
it. Chiddix predicts that ATM will soon gravitate to local area networks
and ultimately become ubiquitous.<BR>
<BR>
But the most portentous announcements of all have come from the telephone
companies, who have the most to lose from this cable-oriented network design.
Both U.S. West and Pacific Bell have disclosed that they are adopting a
combination architecture of fiber and coaxial cable closely resembling the
Time-Warner and TCI projects. This unexpected action by two leading Baby
Bells, of turning their backs on their millions of miles of twisted-pair
copper wires shows both the boldness of the new telephone company leadership
and the imperious power of this digital technology.<BR>
<BR>
From all sides the telecommunications and computer industries are converging
on one essential configuration of advanced parallel-processing hardware,
client/server database software and ATM switching. As microcosm and telecosm
converge in the living room, with interactive digital video and supercomputer
image processing, the leading edge of the digital revolution moves from
millions of offices toward billions of homes. Just as Michael Milken, then
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the late William McGowan of MCI in 1983 rescued
long-distance fiber optics from the never-never lands of the year 2015 to
which AT&amp;T had consigned it, John Malone of TCI, Gerald M. Levin of
Time-Warner and Richard D. McCormick of U.S. West in 1993 have burst open
the floodgates for fiber and ATM in the local loop.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the force behind this revolutionary development was fierce business
and technical rivalry in the marketplace. In the real world the ruling principle
of network development is not imposed standardization by government but
spontaneous order. It springs from the interplay of human creativity and
entrepreneurship with the inexorable laws of physics and technology.<BR>
<BR>
These dynamics of interconnection in the Information Age will continue well
into the next century. The microcosm will yield chips containing billions
of transistors, equivalent to scores of supercomputers on single slivers
of silicon. The telecosm will yield bandwidth exploding into the terahertz
of all- optical networks and the gigahertz of millimeter waves in the air.<BR>
<BR>
Provided that rulers and regulators do not stifle this spiral of opportunity,
the human spirit &quot;emancipated and thus allowed to reach its rarest
talents and aspirations&quot; will continue to amaze the world with heroic
surprises. The Issaquah miracle of Mike Bookey and Lee Dumas and all the
others, and the continuing miracle of American networks, which was entirely
unexpected by the world, will repeat themselves again and again in new forms
of entrepreneurship and technology.

<HR>At first glance, Vahak Hovnanian, a homebuilding tycoon in New Jersey,
would<B> </B>seem an unlikely sort to be chasing rainbows. Yet in the converging
realms of computers and communications that we call the telecosm, rainbows
are less a matter of hue and weather than they are a metaphor for electromagnetism:
the spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies used to build businesses in
the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
An Armenian Christian from Iraq, Hovnanian ran a business building high-quality
&quot;affordable&quot; housing. His first coup came on Labor Day in 1958
when, together with his three older brothers, he bought an apparently undesirable
property near the waterfront in Tom's River for $20,000. From this modest
beginning has arisen not only one of the nation's largest homebuilding enterprises
(divided among the four immigrant brothers), but also a shattering breakthrough
on some seemingly bleak frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum. Together
with maverick inventor Bernard Bossard, Hovnanian has launched a wireless
cellular TV business in frequencies once thought usable only in outer space.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the reason Hovnanian feels comfortable today pioneering on the shores
of the telecosm is that some 35 years ago he was an engineer at Philco Semiconductor
following in the theoretical steps of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories titan William
Shockley. Shockley led the team that plunged into the microcosm of solid-state
physics and invented the transistor. At the heart of all-digital electronics,
this invention still reverberates through the world economy and imposes
its centrifugal rules of enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
This law of the microcosm dictates exponential rises in computer efficiency
as transistors become smaller. It is this law that drives the bulk of the
world's computations to ever- cheaper machines and pushes intelligence from
the center to the fringes of all networks. Today the microcosm is converging
with the telecosm and igniting a new series of industrial shocks and surprises.<BR>
<BR>
The convergence of microcosm and telecosm in an array of multimedia industries
- from personal intelligent communicators to video teleputers to digital
films and publishing - is now the driving force of world economic growth.
John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple Computer, has projected that by
2002 there will be a global business in multimedia totaling some $3.5 trillion
- close to the size of the entire U.S. economy in the early 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
This new world of computer communications will break down into two domains
- the fibersphere and the atmosphere. The fibersphere is the domain of all-optical
networks, with both communications power - bandwidth - and error rate improving
by factors in the millions. In &quot;Into the Fibersphere&quot; (Forbes
ASAP, December 7, 1992), we saw that the potential capacity for communications
in the fibersphere is 1,000 times greater than all the currently used frequencies
in the air - and so radically error-free that it mandates an entirely new
model of wired telecommunications. Now we will discover that the atmosphere
will offer links as mobile and ubiquitous as human beings are. It thus will
force the creation of an entirely new model of wireless networks.<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Sculley's $3 5 trillion dream can be seen as the pot of gold
at the end of Maxwell's rainbow. In 1865, in a visionary coup that the late
Richard Feynman said would leave the American Civil War of the same decade
as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by comparison, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. Encompassing
nearly all the technologies imagined by Sculley, Maxwell's rainbow reaches
from the extremely low frequencies (and gigantic wavelengths) used to communicate
with submarines all the way through the frequencies used in radio, television
and cellular phones, on up to the frequencies of infrared used in TV remotes
and fiber optics, and beyond that to visible and ultraviolet light and X-
rays. In a fabulous feat of unification, Maxwell reduced the entire spectrum
to just four equations in vector calculus. He showed that all such radiations
move at the speed of light - in other words, the wavelength times the frequency
equals the speed of light. These equations pulse at the heart of the information
economy today.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all electromagnetic radiation can bear information, and the higher
the frequencies, the more room they provide for bearing information. As
a practical matter, however, communications engineers have aimed low, thronging
the frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum, comprising far less than
one percent of the total span.<BR>
<BR>
The vast expansion of wireless communications forecast by Sculley, however,
will require the use of higher frequencies far up Maxwell's rainbow. This
means a return to the insights of another great man who walked the halls
of Bell Labs in the late 1940s at the same time as future Nobel laureate
William Shockley, and who left the world transformed in his wake.<BR>
<BR>
In 1948, the same year that Shockley invented the transistor, Claude Shannon
invented the information theory that underlies all modern communications.
At first encounter, information theory is difficult for nonmathematicians,
but computer and telecom executives need focus on only a few key themes.
In defining how much information can be sent down a noisy channel, Shannon
showed that engineers can choose between narrowband high-powered solutions
and broadband low-powered solutions. 
<PRE>


<B>


From Long & Strong to Wide & Weak
</B></PRE>
Assuming that usable bandwidth is scarce and expensive, most wireless engineers
have strived to economize on it. Just as you can get your message through
in a crowded room by talking louder, you can overcome a noisy channel with
more powerful signals. Engineers therefore have pursued a strategy of long
and strong: long wavelengths and powerful transmissions with the scarce
radio frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
Economizing on spectrum, scientists created mostly analog systems such as
AM radios and televisions. Using every point on the wave to convey information
and using high power to overcome noise and extend the range of signals,
the long and strong approach seemed hugely more efficient than digital systems
requiring complex manipulation of long strings of on-off bits.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, however, the long and strong policy of economizing on spectrum
led to using it all up. When everyone talks louder, no one can hear very
well. Today, the favored regions at the bottom of the spectrum are so full
of spectrum- hogging radios, pagers, phones, television, long-distance,
point- to-point, aerospace and other uses that heavy-breathing experts speak
of running out of &quot;air.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's theories reveal the way out of this problem. In a counterintuitive
and initially baffling redefinition of the nature of noise in a communications
channel, Shannon showed that a flow of signals conveys information only
to the extent that it provides unexpected data - only to the extent that
it adds to what you already know. Another name for a stream of unexpected
bits is noise. Termed Gaussian, or white, noise, such a transmission resembles
random &quot;white&quot; light, which cloaks the entire rainbow of colors
in a bright blur. Shannon showed that the more a transmission resembles
this form of noise, the more information it can hold.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's alternative to long and strong is wide and weak: not fighting
noise with electrical power but joining it with noiselike information, not
talking louder but talking softer in more elaborate codes using more bandwidth.
For example, in transmitting 40 megabits per second - the requirement for
truly high-resolution images and sounds - Shannon showed some 45 years ago
that using more bandwidth can lower the needed signal-to- noise ratio from
a level of one million to one to a ratio of 30.6 to one. This huge gain
comes merely from increasing the bandwidth of the signal from two megahertz
(millions of cycles per second) to eight megahertz. That means a 33,000-fold
increase in communications efficiency in exchange for just a fourfold increase
in bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Such an explosion of efficiency radically limits the need to waste watts
in order to overcome noise. More communications power comes from less electrical
power. Thus, Shannon shows the way to fulfill Sculley's vision of universal
low-powered wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
This vision of wide and weak is at the heart of the most promising technologies
of today, from the advanced digital teleputer sets of American HDTV to ubiquitous
mobile phones and computers in so-called personal communications networks
(PCNs). Shannon's theories of the telecosm provide the basic science behind
both Sculley's dream and Hovnanian's video spectrum breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's world, however, is not nirvana, and there is no free lunch. Compensating
for the exponential rise in communications power is an exponential rise
in complexity. Larger bandwidths mean larger, more complex codes and exponentially
rising burdens of computation for the decoding and error-correcting of messages.
In previous decades, handling 40 megabits per second was simply out of the
question with existing computer technology. For the last 30 years, this
electronic bottleneck has blocked the vistas of efficient communication
opened by Shannon's research.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1990s, however, the problem of soaring complexity has met its match
- and then some - in exponential gains of computer efficiency. Not only
has the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology been doubling every 18
months but the pace of advance has been accelerating into the 1990s. Moreover,
the chips central to digital communications - error correction, compression,
coding and decoding - are digital signal processors. As we have seen, the
cost-effectiveness of DSPs has been increasing - in millions of computer
instructions per second (MIPS) per dollar - some tenfold every two years.<BR>
<BR>
This wild rush in DSPs will eventually converge with the precipitous plunge
in price-performance ratios of general-purpose microprocessors. Led by Silicon
Graphics' impending new TFP Cray supercomputer on a chip, Digital Equipment's
Alpha AXP device and Hewlett Packard's Precision Architecture 7100, micros
are moving beyond 100-megahertz clock rates. They are shifting from a regime
of processing 32-bit words at a time to a regime of processing 64-bit words.
This expands the total addressable memory by a factor of four billion. Together
with increasing use of massively parallel DSP architectures, these gains
will keep computers well ahead of the complexity problem in broadband communications.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that while complexity rises exponentially with bandwidth,
computer efficiencies are rising even faster. The result is to open new
vistas of spectrum in the atmosphere as dramatic as the gains of spectrum
so far achieved in the fibersphere. 
<PRE>


<B>


Attacking Through the Air
</B></PRE>
Hovnanian's campaign into the spectrum began when a cable company announced
one day in 1985 that under the Cable Act of 1984 and franchise rights granted
by local governments, it had the right to wire one of his housing developments
then under construction. Until that day, Hovnanian's own company could package
cable with his homes through what are called satellite master antenna TV
systems. In essence, each Hovnanian development had its own cable head end
where programs are collected and sent out to subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
When the cable company, now Monmouth Cable Vision, went to court and its
claim was upheld by a judge, Hovnanian sought alternatives. First he flirted
with the idea of having the phone company deliver compressed video to his
homes. In 1986, in the era before FCC Commissioner Alfred Sikes, that was
both illegal and impractical. Then he met Bernard Bossard and decided to
attack through the air. An early pioneer in microchips who had launched
a semiconductor firm and eventually sold it to M/A COM, Bossard was familiar
with both the soaring power of computers and the murky problems of broadband
noise that have long restricted the air to a small number of broadcast AM
TV stations.<BR>
<BR>
Air delivery of cable television programming had long seemed unpromising.
Not only was there too little spectrum available to compete with cable,
but what spectrum there was, was guarded by the FCC and state public utilities
commissions. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s &quot;wireless cable&quot;
did become a niche market, led by Microband Wireless Cable and rivals and
imitators across the land. Using fragments of a frequency band between 2.5
and 2.7 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), Microband, after some
financial turmoil, now profitably broadcasts some 16 channels to 35,000
New York City homes in line of sight from the top of the Empire State Building.
As long as they are restricted to a possible maximum of 200 megahertz and
use AM, however, wireless firms will not long be able to compete with the
cable industry. Cable companies offer an installed base of potential gigahertz
connections and near universal coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Having spent much of his life working with microwaves for satellites and
the military, Bossard had a better idea. He claimed he could move up the
spectrum and pioneer on frontiers of frequency between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz,
previously used chiefly in outer space. That would mean he could command
in the air some half a million times the communications power, or bandwidth,
of typical copper telephone links, some ten times the bandwidth of existing
wireless cable, some four times the bandwidth of the average cable industry
coaxial connection, and twice the bandwidth of the most advanced cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional wisdom was that these microwaves (above about 12 gigahertz)
are useless for anything but point-to-point transmissions and are doubtful
even for these. For radio communication, the prevailing folklore preferred
frequencies that are cheap to transmit long distances and that can penetrate
buildings and tunnels, bounce off the ionosphere or scuttle across continents
along the surface of the earth. The higher the frequency, the less it can
perform these feats essential to all broadcasting - and the less it can
be sent long distances at all.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it was believed, these millimeter-sized microwaves not only would
fail to penetrate structures and other obstacles but would reflect off them
and off particles in the air in a way that would cause hopeless mazes of
multipath. Multipath would be translated into several images, i.e., ghosts,
on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there was the real show-stopper. Everyone knew that these frequencies
are microwaves. The key property of microwaves, as demonstrated in the now
ubiquitous ovens, is absorption by water. Microwaves cook by exciting water
molecules to a boil. Microwave towers are said to kill birds by irradiating
their fluids. Microwave radar systems won't work in the rain. Mention microwaves
as a possible solution to the spectrum shortage, and everyone - from editors
at Forbes to gurus at Microsoft, from cable executives to Bell Labs researchers
- laughs and tells you about the moisture problem.<BR>
<BR>
So it was no surprise that when in 1986 Bossard went to M/A COM and other
companies and financiers with his idea of TV broadcasting at 28 gigahertz,
he was turned down flat. Amid much talk of potential &quot;violations of
the laws of physics,&quot; jokes about broiling pigeons and warnings of
likely resistance from the FCC, he was spurned by all. In fairness to his
detractors, Bossard had no license, patent or prototype at the time. But
these holes in his plan did not deter Vahak Hovnanian and his son Shant
from investing many millions of dollars in the project. It could be the
best investment the Hovnanian tycoons ever made.

New Rule of Radio
</B></PRE>
For 35 years, the wireless communications industry has been inching up the
spectrum, shifting slowly from long and strong wavelengths toward wide and
weak bands of shorter wavelengths. Mobile phone services have moved from
the 1950s radio systems using low FM frequencies near 100 megahertz, to
the 1960s spectrum band of 450 megahertz, to the current cellular band of
900 megahertz accommodating more than 10 million cellular subscribers in
the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1990s, this trend will accelerate sharply. Accommodating hundreds
of millions of users around the world, cellular communications will turn
digital, leap up the spectrum and even move into video. Shannon's laws show
that this will impel vast increases in the cost-effectiveness of communications.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the new rule of radio is the shorter the transmission path,
the better the system. Like transistors on semiconductor chips, transmitters
are more efficient the more closely they are packed together. As Peter Huber
writes in his masterly new book, The Geodesic Network 2, the new regime
favors &quot;geodesic networks,&quot; with radios intimately linked in tiny
microcells. As in the law of the microcosm, the less the space, the more
the room.<BR>
<BR>
This rule turns the conventional wisdom of microwaves upside down. For example,
it is true that microwaves don't travel far in the atmosphere. You don't
want to use them to transmit 50,000 watts of Rush Limbaugh over 10 midwestern
states, but to accommodate 200 million two-way communicators will require
small cells; you don't want the waves to travel far. It is true that microwaves
will not penetrate most buildings and other obstacles, but with lots of
small cells, you don't want the waves to penetrate walls to adjacent offices.<BR>
<BR>
Microwaves require high-power systems to transmit, but only if you want
to send them long distances. Wattage at the receiver drops off in proportion
to the fourth power of the distance from the transmitter. Reducing cell
sizes as you move up the spectrum lowers power needs far more than higher
frequencies increase them. Just as important, mobile systems must be small
and light. The higher the frequency, the smaller the antenna and the lighter
the system can be.<BR>
<BR>
All this high-frequency gear once was prohibitively expensive. Any functions
over two gigahertz require gallium arsenide chips, which are complex and
costly. Yet the cost of gallium arsenide devices is dropping every day as
their market expands. Meanwhile, laboratory teams are now tweaking microwaves
out of silicon. In the world of electronics - where prices drop by a third
with every doubling of accumulated sales - any ubiquitous product will soon
be cheap.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm dictates that the higher the frequency, the shorter
the wavelength, the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the antenna, the slimmer
the cell and ultimately, the cheaper and better the communication. The working
of this law will render obsolete the entire idea of scarce spectrum and
launch an era of advances in telecommunications comparable to the recent
gains in computing. Transforming the computer and phone industries, the
converging spirits of Maxwell, Shannon and Shockley even pose a serious
challenge to the current revolutionaries in cellular telephony.

The New PC Revolution: PCN
</B></PRE>
Many observers herald the huge coming impact of wireless on the computer
industry, and they are right. But this impact will be dwarfed by the impact
of computers on wireless.<BR>
<BR>
In personal communications networks (PCN), the cellular industry today is
about to experience its own personal computer revolution. Just as the personal
computer led to systems thousands of times more efficient in MIPS per dollar
than the mainframes and minicomputers that preceded it, PCNs will bring
an exponential plunge of costs. These networks will be based on microcells
often measured in hundreds of meters rather than in tens of miles and will
interlink smart digital appliances, draining power in milliwatts rather
than dumb phones using watts. When the convulsion ends later this decade,
this new digital cellular phone will stand as the world's most pervasive
PC. As mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet, these PICOs will recognize
speech, navigate streets, take notes, keep schedules, collect mail, manage
money, open the door and start the car, among other computer functions we
cannot imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
Like the computer establishment before it, current cellular providers often
seem unprepared for this next computer revolution. They still live in a
world of long and strong - high- powered systems at relatively low frequencies
and with short- lived batteries - rather than in a PCN world of low-power
systems at microwave frequencies and with batteries that last for days.<BR>
<BR>
Ready or not, though, the revolution will happen anyway, and it will transform
the landscape over the next five years. We can guess the pattern by considering
the precedents. In computers, the revolution took 10 years. It began in
1977 when large centralized systems with attached dumb terminals commanded
nearly 100 percent of the world's computer power and ended in 1987 with
such large systems commanding less than one percent of the world's computer
power. The pace of progress in digital electronics has accelerated sharply
since the early 1980s. Remember yesterday, when digital signal processing
(DSP) - the use of specialized computers to convert, compress, shape and
shuffle digital signals in real time - constituted an exorbitant million-dollar
obstacle to all-digital communications? Many current attitudes toward wireless
stem from that time, which was some five years ago. Today, digital signal
processors are the fastest-moving technology in all computing. Made on single
chips or multichip modules, DSPs are increasing their cost- effectiveness
tenfold every two years. As radio pioneer Donald Steinbrecher says, &quot;That
changes wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thus, we can expect the cellular telephone establishment to reach a crisis
more quickly than the mainframe establishment did. The existing cellular
infrastructure will persist for vehicular use.<BR>
<BR>
As the intelligence in networks migrates to microcells, the networks themselves
must become dumb. A complex network, loaded up with millions of lines of
software code, cannot keep up with the efflorescent diversity and creativity
among ever more intelligent digital devices on its periphery. This rule
is true for the broadband wire links of fiber optics, as intelligent switching
systems give way to passive all-optical networks. It is also true of cellular
systems.<BR>
<BR>
Nick Kauser, McCaw Cellular Communications' executive vice- president and
chief of technology, faced this problem early in 1991 when the company decided
to create a North American Cellular Network for transparent roaming throughout
the regions of Cellular One. &quot;The manufacturers always want to sell
switches that do more and more. But complex switches take so long to program
that you end up doing less and less,&quot; says Wayne Perry, McCaw vice-chairman.
Each time Kauser tried to change software code in one of McCaw's Ericsson
switches, it might have taken six months. Each time he wanted to add customer
names above a 64,000 limit, Ericsson tried to persuade him to buy a new
switch. The Ericsson switches, commented one McCaw engineer, offer a huge
engine but a tiny gas tank. The problem is not peculiar to Ericsson, however;
it is basic to the very idea of complex switch- based services on any supplier's
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
When McCaw voiced frustration, one of the regional Bell operating companies
offered to take over the entire problem at a cost of some $200 million.
Instead, Kauser created a Signaling System 7 (SS-7) network plus an intelligent
database on four Tandem fault-tolerant computers, for some $15 million.
Kauser maintains that the current services offered by North American Cellular
could not be duplicated for 10 times that amount, if at all, in a switch-based
system. Creating a dumb network and off- loading the intelligence on computer
servers saved McCaw hundreds of millions of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm is a centrifuge, inexorably pushing intelligence
to the edges of networks. Telecom equipment suppliers can no more trap it
in the central switch than IBM could monopolize it in mainframes.<BR>
<BR>
Kauser should recognize that this rule applies to McCaw no less than to
Ericsson. His large standardized systems with 30- mile cells and relatively
dumb, high-powered phones resemble big proprietary mainframe networks. In
the computer industry, these standardized architectures gave way to a mad
proliferation of diverse personal computer nets restricted to small areas
and interlinked by hubs and routers. The same pattern will develop in cellular.

Could &quot;Charles&quot; Upend McCaw?
</B></PRE>
Together with GTE and the regional Bell operating company cellular divisions,
McCaw is now in the position of DEC in 1977. With its new ally, AT&amp;T,
McCaw is brilliantly attacking the mainframe establishment of the wire-line
phone companies. But the mainframe establishment of wires is not McCaw's
real competition. Not stopping at central switches, the law of the microcosm
is about to subvert the foundations of conventional cellular technology
as well. Unless McCaw and the other cellular providers come to terms with
the new PC networks that go by the name of PCNs, they will soon suffer the
fate of the minicomputer firms of the last decade. McCaw could well be upended
by its founder's original vision of his company - a PICO he called &quot;Charles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just as in the computer industry in the late 1970s, the fight for the future
is already under way. Complicating the conflict is the influence of European
and Japanese forces protecting the past in the name of progress. Under pressure
from EEC industrial politicians working with the guidance of engineers from
Ericsson, the Europeans have adopted a new digital cellular system called
Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) after the commission that conceived it.<BR>
<BR>
GSM is a very conservative digital system that multiplies the number of
users in each cellular channel by a factor of three. GSM uses an access
method called time-division multiple access (TDMA). Suggestive of the time-sharing
methods used by minicomputers and mainframes to accommodate large numbers
of users on centralized computers, TDMA stems from the time-division multiplexing
employed by phone companies around the world to put more than one phone
call on each digital line. Thus, both the telephone and the computer establishments
are comfortable with time division.<BR>
<BR>
Under pressure from European firms eager to sell equipment in America, the
U.S. Telephone Industry Association two years ago adopted a TDMA standard
similar to the European GSM. Rather than creating a wholly new system exploiting
the distributed powers of the computer revolution, the TIA favored a TDMA
overlay on the existing analog infrastructure. Under the influence of Ericsson,
McCaw and some of the RBOCs took the TDMA bait.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it was in the name of competitiveness and technological progress,
and of keeping up with the Europeans and Japanese, that the U.S. moved to
embrace an obsolescent cellular system. It made no difference that the Europeans
and Japanese were technologically well in our wake. Just as in the earlier
case of analog HDTV, however, the entrepreneurial creativity of the U.S.
digital electronics industry is launching an array of compelling alternatives
just in time.<BR>
<BR>
Infusing cellular telephony with the full powers of wide and weak - combining
Shannon's vision with computer advances - are two groups of engineers from
MIT who spun out to launch new companies. Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, is
led by former professor Irwin Jacobs and telecom pioneer Andrew Viterbi.
A Shannon disciple whose eponymous algorithm is widely used in digital wire-line
telephony, Viterbi now is leading an effort to transform digital wireless
telephony. The other firm, Steinbrecher Corp. of Woburn, Mass., is led by
an inventor from the MIT Radio Astronomy Lab named Donald Steinbrecher.<BR>
<BR>
Like Bernie Bossard and Vahak Hovnanian, the leaders of Qualcomm and Steinbrecher
received the ultimate accolade for an innovator: They were all told their
breakthroughs were impossible. Indeed, the leaders at Qualcomm were still
contending that Steinbrecher's system would not work just weeks ago when
PacTel pushed the two firms together. Now they provide the foundations for
a radical new regime in distributed wireless computer telephony. 
<PRE>


<B>


Signals in Pseudonoise
</B></PRE>
Ten years ago at Linkabit, the current leaders of Qualcomm conceived and
patented the TDMA technology adopted as the U.S. standard by the Telephone
Industry Association. Like analog HDTV, it was a powerful advance for its
time. But even then, Viterbi and Jacobs were experimenting with a Shannonesque
technology.<BR>
<BR>
A classic example of the efficacy of wide and weak, CDMA exploits the resemblance
between noise and information. The system began in the military as an effort
to avoid jamming or air- tapping of combat messages. Qualcomm brings CDMA
to the challenge of communications on the battlefronts of big-city cellular.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than compressing each call into between three and 10 tiny TDMA time
slots in a 30-kilohertz cellular channel, Qualcomm's CDMA spreads a signal
across a comparatively huge 1. 25-megahertz swath of the cellular spectrum.
This allows many users to share the same spectrum space at one time. Each
phone is programmed with a specific pseudonoise code, which is used to stretch
a low-powered signal over a wide frequency band. The base station uses the
same code in inverted form to &quot;despread&quot; and reconstitute the
original signal. All other codes remain spread out, indistinguishable from
background noise.<BR>
<BR>
Jacobs compares TDMA and CDMA to different strategies of communication at
a cocktail party. In the TDMA analogy, each person would restrict his or
her talk to a specific time slot while everyone else remains silent. This
system would work well as long as the party was managed by a dictator who
controlled all conversations by complex rules and a rigid clock. In CDMA,
on the other hand, everyone can talk at once but in different languages.
Each person listens for messages in his or her own language or code and
ignores all other sounds as background noise. Although this system allows
each person to speak freely, it requires constant control of the volume
of the speakers. A speaker who begins yelling can drown out surrounding
messages and drastically reduce the total number of conversations that can
be sustained.<BR>
<BR>
For years, this problem of the stentorian guest crippled CDMA as a method
of increasing the capacity of cellular systems. Spread spectrum had many
military uses because its unlocalized signal and cryptic codes made it very
difficult to jam or overhear. In a cellular environment, however, where
cars continually move in and out from behind trucks, buildings and other
obstacles, causing huge variations in power, CDMA systems would be regularly
swamped by stentorian guests. Similarly, nearby cars would tend to dominate
faraway vehicles. This was termed the near-far problem. When you compound
this challenge with a static of multipath signals causing hundreds of 10,000-to-
1 gyrations in power for every foot traveled by the mobile unit - so-called
Rayleigh interference pits and spikes - you can comprehend the general incredulity
toward CDMA among cellular cognoscenti. Indeed, as recently as 1991, leading
experts at Bell Labs, Stanford University and Bellcore confidently told
me the problem was a show-stopper; it could not be overcome.<BR>
<BR>
Radio experts, however, underestimate the power of the microcosm. Using
digital signal processing, error correction and other microcosmic tools,
wattage spikes and pits 100 times a second can be regulated by electronic
circuitry that adjusts the power at a rate of more than 800 times a second.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this result, Qualcomm uses two layers of controls. First is a
relatively crude top layer that employs the automatic gain control device
on handsets to constantly adjust the power sent by the handset to the level
of power received by it from the base station. This rough adjustment does
not come near to solving the problem, but it brings a solution into reach
by using more complex and refined techniques.<BR>
<BR>
In the second power-control step, the base station measures the handset's
signal-to-noise and bit-error ratios once every 1.25 milliseconds (800 times
a second). Depending on whether these ratios are above or below a constantly
recomputed threshold, the base station sends a positive or negative pulse,
either raising or lowering the power some 25 percent. 
<PRE>


<B>


Dynamic Cells
</B></PRE>
Passing elaborate field tests with flying colors, this power- control mechanism
has the further effect of dynamically changing the size of cells. In a congested
cell, the power of all phones rises to overcome mutual interference. On
the margin, these high- powered transmissions overflow into neighboring
cells where they may be picked up by adjacent base station equipment. In
a quiet cell, power is so low that the cell effectively shrinks, transmitting
no interference at all to neighboring cells and improving their performance.
This kind of dynamic adjustment of cell sizes is impossible in a TDMA system,
where adjacent cells use completely different frequencies and fringe handsets
may begin to chirp like Elmer Fudd.<BR>
<BR>
Once the stentorian voice could be instantly abated, power control changed
from a crippling weakness of CDMA into a commanding asset. Power usage is
a major obstacle to the PCN future. All market tests show that either heavy
or short-lived batteries greatly reduce the attractiveness of the system.
Because the Qualcomm feedback system keeps power always at the lowest feasible
level, batteries in CDMA phones actually are lasting far longer than in
TDMA phones. CDMA phones transmit at an average of two milliwatts, compared
with 600 milliwatts and higher for most other cellular systems.<BR>
<BR>
A further advantage of wide and weak comes in handling multipath signals,
which bounce off obstacles and arrive at different times at the receiver.
Multipath just adds to the accuracy of CDMA. The Qualcomm system combines
the three strongest signals into one. Called a rake receiver and co- invented
by Paul Green, currently at IBM and author of Fiber Optic Networks (Prentice
Hall, 1992), this combining function works even on signals from different
cells and thus facilitates hand-offs. In TDMA, signals arriving at the wrong
time are pure interference in someone else's time slot; in CDMA, they strengthen
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, CDMA allows simple and soft hand-offs. Because all the phones are
using the same spectrum space, moving from one cell to another is easy.
CDMA avoids all the frequency juggling of TDMA systems as they shuffle calls
among cells and time slots. As the era of PCN microcells approaches, this
advantage will become increasingly crucial. Cellular systems that spurn
Qualcomm today may find themselves in a quagmire of TDMA microcells tomorrow.
Together, all the gains from CDMA bring about a tenfold increase over current
analog capacity. In wireless telephony above all, wide and weak will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Like any obsolescent scheme challenged by a real innovation - and like minicomputers
and mainframes challenged by the PC - TDMA is being sharply improved by
its proponents. The inheritors of the Linkabit TDMA patents at Hughes and
International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMMC) have introduced extended TDMA,
claiming a 19-fold advance over current analog capacity. Showing a conventional
cellular outlook, however, E-TDMA fatally adopts the idea of increasing
capacity by lowering speech quality. This moves in exactly the wrong direction.
PCN will not triumph through compromises based on a scarce-spectrum mentality.
PCN will multiply bandwidth to make the acoustics of digital cellular even
better than the acoustics of wire-line phones, just as the acoustics of
digital CDs far excel the acoustics of analog records.<BR>
<BR>
Riding the microcosmic gains of digital signal processing, CDMA inherently
offers greater room for improvement than TDMA does. Bringing the computer
revolution to cellular telephony, CDMA at its essence replaces frequency
shuffling with digital intelligence. Supplanting the multiple radios of
TDMA - each with a fixed frequency - are digital-signal-processing chips
that find a particular message across a wide spectrum swath captured by
one broadband radio.<BR>
<BR>
With the advance in digital electronics, the advantage of CDMA continually
increases. As the most compute-intensive system, CDMA gains most from the
onrushing increases in the cost- effectiveness of semiconductor electronics.
Qualcomm recently announced that it has reduced all the digital signal processing
for CDMA into one application-specific chip.<BR>
<BR>
For all the indispensable advances of CDMA, however, Qualcomm cannot prevail
alone. It brilliantly executes the move to digital codes, but proprietary
mainframe computer networks are digital, too. As presently conceived, CDMA
still aspires to be a cellular standard using the same mainframe architecture
of mobile telephone switching offices that now serve the analog cellular
system. In itself the Qualcomm solution does little to move cellular toward
the ever cheaper, smaller and more open architectures that now dominate
network computing and will shape PCN.

Hearing Feathers Crash Amid Heavy Metal
</B></PRE>
Consummating the PCN revolution - with its millions of microcells around
the globe and its myriad digital devices and frequencies - will require
a fundamental breakthrough in cellular radio technology. In the new Steinbrecher
minicell introduced early this month at the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association show, that breakthrough is at hand. The first true PC server
for PCN, this small box ultimately costing a few thousand dollars will both
replace and far outperform a 1,000-square-foot base station costing more
than a million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, in an entrepreneurial economy, crucial innovations come as an
utter surprise to all the experts in the field. Donald Steinbrecher began
in the Radio Astronomy Lab at MIT in the 1960s and early 1970s, creating
receivers that could resolve a random cosmic ray among a mass of electromagnetic
noise. This required radios with huge dynamic range - radios that could
hear a feather drop at a heavy metal rock concert. He and his students solved
this intractable problem by creating unique high-performance receivers and
frequency &quot;Mixers.&quot; These could process huge spans of spectrum
with immense variations of power and translate them without loss into intermediate
frequencies. Then, computer systems convert the signals from analog to digital
and analyze them with digital signal processors.<BR>
<BR>
Moving out to begin his own company in 1973, Steinbrecher and his colleagues
made several inventions in the fields of radar and digital signal analysis.
At first, most of their customers were national security contractors in
the intelligence field. For example, Steinbrecher supplied the radios for
the ROTHR (remote over the horizon radar) systems that became famous for
their role in the war against airborne drug traffic. Then in 1986, the company
was asked if its equipment could work in the cellular band.<BR>
<BR>
After cosmic rays and battlefield radar, the cellular band was easy. When
he saw that the digital signal processors at the heart of his systems were
dropping in price tenfold every two years, Steinbrecher knew that his esoteric
radios could become a consumer product.<BR>
<BR>
Translated to cellular, this technology opens entire new frontiers for wireless
telephony. Rather than tuning into one fixed frequency as current cellular
radios do, Steinbrecher's cells can use a high-dynamic-range digital radio
to down-convert and digitize the entire cellular band. TDMA, CDMA, near
or far, analog cellular, video, voice or data, in any combination, it makes
no difference to the Steinbrecher system. His minicell converts them all
at once to a digital bit stream. The DSPs take over from there, sorting
out the TDMA and CDMA signals from the analog signals and reducing each
to digital voice. To the extent the Steinbrecher system prevails, it would
end the need for hybrid phones and make possible a phased shift to PCN or
a variety of other digital services.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping to use Qualcomm chipsets and other technology, Steinbrecher could
facilitate the acceptance of CDMA. For CDMA, the minicell provides a new,
far cheaper radio front end that offers further relief to the near-far problem
and is open to the diverse codes and fast-moving technologies of PCN. For
the current cellular architecture, however, Steinbrecher offers only creative
destruction, doing for large base stations what the integrated circuit did
for racks of vacuum tubes in old telephone switches.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the new minicell replaces a rigid structure of giant analog
mainframes with a system of wireless local area networks. Reconciling a
variety of codes and technologies, the Steinbrecher devices resemble the
smart hubs and routers from SynOptics Communications and Cisco Systems that
are transforming the world of wired computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Best of all, at a time when the computer industry is preparing a massive
invasion of the air, these wide and weak radios can handle voice, data and
even video at the same time. Further, by cheaply accommodating a move from
scores of large base stations to scores of thousands of minicells per city
- on poles, down alleys or in elevator shafts - the system fulfills the
promise of the computer revolution as a spectrum multiplier. Since each
new minicell can use all the frequencies currently used by a large cell
site, the multiplication of cells achieves a similar multiplication of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Steinbrecher receivers can accommodate the coming move into
higher frequencies. Banishing once and for all the concept of spectrum scarcity,
these high-dynamic-range receivers can already handle frequencies up to
the &quot;W band&quot; of 90 gigahertz and more. 
<PRE>


<B>


Boundless Bandwidth
</B></PRE>
The future of wireless communications is boundless bandwidth, accomplished
through the Shannon strategy of wide and weak signals, moving to ever smaller
cells with lower power at higher frequencies. The PCN systems made possible
by Qualcomm and Steinbrecher apply this approach chiefly to voice and data.
Recent announcements by Bossard and Hovnanian extend the concept to television
video as well. Last December, they disclosed that their company, Cellular
Vision, was already wirelessly delivering 49 cable television channels to
350 homes near Brighton Beach, Long Island, in the 28-gigahertz band. They
declared a plan to soon sign up some 5,000 new customers a month all over
New York.<BR>
<BR>
Among engineers in cellular and cable firms, Cellular Vision evokes the
same responses of incredulity and denial familiar at Qualcomm and Steinbrecher.
Like them, Bossard is resolutely on the right side of the Shannon and Shockley
divide. In answer to the multitude of qualms and objections and demurrals,
all three companies cite the huge benefits of more bandwidth. Qualcomm can
assign some 416 times as much bandwidth to each call as a current cellular
or TDMA system. Steinbrecher's minicell receivers can process 4,160 times
as much bandwidth as an analog cell site or TDMA radio.<BR>
<BR>
Hovnanian achieves some 300 times the bandwidth of a broadcast TV station
and some three times the bandwidth of even a typical cable head end. For
Hovnanian's so-called multipoint local distribution system, the FCC has
allocated a total of two gigahertz between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz - one
gigahertz for TV and one gigahertz for experimental data and phone service.
This large swath of spectrum allows Cellular Vision to substitute bandwidth
for power. Using FM rather than the AM system of cable, Cellular Vision
gains the same kind of increased fidelity familiar in FM radio. Assigning
20 megahertz to each channel - three times the six megahertz of an analog
system - Cellular Vision proves the potency of wide and weak by getting
20 decibels - some 10 times - more signal quality. These extra decibels
come in handy in the rain.<BR>
<BR>
With a radius of three miles, Cellular Vision cells are about 100 times
smaller than telephone cells. Transmitting only 10 milliwatts per channel
over a three-mile radius, the system gets far better signal-to-noise ratios
than the three-watt radios of cellular phones or the multikilowatt systems
of AM radio or television broadcasts. The millimeter wavelengths at 28 gigahertz
allow narrowband high-gain antennas that lock onto the right signal and
isolate it from neighboring cells. At 28 gigahertz, small antennas command
the performance of much larger ones (for example, a six-inch antenna at
28 gigahertz is equivalent to a three-foot antenna at 4 gigahertz or a 300-foot
antenna at broadcast television frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
In Brighton Beach the receiving antennas, using a fixed- phased-array technology,
are just four inches square, and the transmitting antennas deliver 49 channels
from a one-inch omnidirectional device on a box the size of a suitcase.
Between cells, these transmitters can send programming and other information
through a conventional point-to-point microwave link. 
<PRE>


<B>


Singing in the Rain
</B></PRE>
So what happens in the rain? Well, it seems that Cellular Vision does better
than conventional cable. When you have small cells in geodesic low-power
wireless networks using the full computational resources of modern microchips,
you have plenty of extra decibels in your signal-to-noise budget to endure
the most violent storms. Indeed, the 350 Brighton Beach customers of Cellular
Vision received continuous service during the November 1992 near hurricane
in New York, which brought floods that interrupted many cable networks for
hours. One competitive advantage of Cellular Vision over cable seems to
be less vulnerability to water.<BR>
<BR>
Moving television radically toward the regime of wide and weak, Bossard
and the Hovnanians have changed the dimensions of the air. However, they
cannot escape the usual burdens of the innovator. Any drastic innovation
must be some 10 times as good as what it replaces. Otherwise, the installed
base, engineering momentum and customer loyalty of the incumbents will prevail
against it.<BR>
<BR>
Cellular Vision faces a wired cable system with some $18 billion in installed
base. Already deploying fiber at a fast pace, cable companies plan to move
within the next year toward digital compression schemes that increase capacity
or resolution by a factor of between six and 10 (depending on the character
of the programming). That means some 500 digital channels or more. TCI,
the leading cable company, has ordered some one million cable converter
and decompression boxes from General Instruments' Jerrold subsidiary for
delivery late in 1993. In the U.S. cable industry, Hovnanian faces an aggressively
moving target. Most cable experts doubt he can make much of a dent.<BR>
<BR>
This view may be shortsighted. Clearly, Cellular Vision - and its likely
imitators - can compete in the many areas with incompetent cable systems,
in areas yet unreached by cable or in new projects launched by developers
such as the Hovnanians. In the rest of the world, cable systems are rare.
Cellular Vision is finding rich opportunities abroad, from Latvia to New
Zealand. Most of all, as time passes, Cellular Vision might find itself
increasingly well positioned for a world of untethered digital devices.<BR>
<BR>
Such a cellular system could be adapted to mobile telephone or computer
services. With a bit-error rate of one in 10 billion, it could theoretically
transmit computer data without error correction. With one gigahertz of bandwidth,
the system could function easily as a backbone for PCN applications, collecting
calls from handsets operating at lower frequencies and passing them on to
telephone or cellular central offices or to intelligent network facilities
of the local phone companies.<BR>
<BR>
The future local loop will combine telephone, teleputer and digital video
services, together with speech recognition and other complex features, in
patterns that will differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Easily customizable
from cell to cell, a system like Bossard's might well offer powerful advantages.<BR>
<BR>
In an era of bandwidth abundance, the Negroponte switch - with voice pushed
to the air and video onto wires - may well give way to this division between
fibersphere and atmosphere. With the fibersphere offering virtually unlimited
bandwidth for fixed communications over long distances, the local loop will
be the bottleneck, thronged with millions of wireless devices. Under these
conditions, a move to high-frequency cellular systems is imperative to carry
the increasing floods of digital video overflowing from the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, led by Qualcomm, Steinbrecher and Cellular Vision, a new generation
of companies is emerging to challenge the assumptions and structures of
the existing information economy. All these companies are recent startups,
with innovations entirely unexpected by international standards bodies,
university experts and government officials. They are the fruit of an entrepreneurial
America, guided by the marketplace into the microcosm and telecosm. 
<PRE>

Why Imitate European Failures?
</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, the European and Japanese experiences with government-guided
strategies should give pause to proponents of similar policies here. Thirty
years of expensive industrial policy targeting computers has left the Europeans
with no significant computer firms at all. The Japanese have done better,
but even they have been losing market share across the board to the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
In the converging crescendos of advance in digital wireless telephony and
computing, progress is surging far beyond all the regulatory maps and guidebooks
of previous years. If the entire capacity of the 28-gigahertz band, renewed
every three miles, is open to telephony and video, bandwidth will be scarcely
more limiting in wireless than it is in glass.<BR>
<BR>
In this emerging world of boundless bandwidth, companies will prevail only
by transcending the folklore of scarcity and embracing the full promise
of the digital dawn. In an era of accelerating transition, the rule of success
will be self- cannibalization. Wire-line phone companies are not truly profitable
today; their reported earnings all spring from slow depreciation of installed
plant and equipment that are fast becoming worthless. As George Calhoun
of IMMC demonstrates in his superb new book, Wireless Access and the Local
Telephone Network (Artech, 1992), new digital wireless connections are already
less than one-third the cost of installing wire-line phones. For the RBOCs,
aggressively attacking their own obsolescent enterprises is their only hope
of prosperity.<BR>
<BR>
As Joseph Schlosser of Coopers & Lybrand observes, self- cannibalization
will not appear to be in the financial interests of the established firms;
it will not prove out in net-present- value terms. There will be no studies
to guarantee its success. Executives will have to earn their pay by going
with their gut. As semiconductor and computer companies have already learned,
phone and cable companies will discover that self-cannibalization is the
only way to succeed in this era - the only way to stop others from capturing
the heart of your business.<BR>
<BR>
This is the lesson of the last decade. When Craig McCaw sold his cable properties
and plunged into cellular telephony and $2 billion of Michael Milken's junk
bond debt, there was no way to prove him right. Today AT&T is preparing
to launch him as a rival to Bill Gates as the nation's richest man. Yet
McCaw cannot rest on his laurels; the hour of the cannibal is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
In theory, the transition should not be difficult for this resourceful and
ingenious entrepreneur, who has long been a leading prophet of ubiquitous
wireless phones and computers - his predicted personal digital assistant,
&quot;Charles.&quot; But a company that has paid billions for its 25-megahertz
national swath of long and strong frequencies faces especially acute dilemmas
in moving toward a regime of wide and weak. As a man - and company - that
has made such transitions before, McCaw is favored by history and by AT&amp;T.
As a giant pillar of the new establishment, though, McCaw may find it as
difficult to shift gears as did the computer establishment before him. The
stakes are even higher. The next decade will see the emergence of fortunes
in ever- changing transmutations of PCN, digital video, multimedia and wireless
computers that dwarf the yields of cable and cellular. The window of opportunity
opens wide and weak.

Philip Hope, divisional vice president for engineering systems of EDS,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has an IQ problem. His chief client and owner, General Motors, wants to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
interconnect thousands of 3-D graphics and computer aided engineering (CAE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
workstations with mainframes and supercomputers at Headquarters, with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
automated assembly equipment at factories in Lordstown, Indiana, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Detroit, with other powerful processors at their technical center in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren, Michigan, with their Opel plant in Ruesselheim, Germany, and with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their design center outside San Diego. On behalf of another client, Hope<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wants to link multimedia stations for remote diagnostics, X-ray analysis,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and pharmaceutical modeling in hospitals and universities across the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
country.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any function involving 3-D graphics, CAE, supercomputer visualization,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lossless diagnostic imaging, and advanced medical simulations demands large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth or communications power. Graphics workstations often operate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
screens with a million picture elements (pixels), and use progressive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
scanning at 60 frames or images a second. Each pixel may entail 24 bits
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
color. That adds up fast to billions of bits (gigabits) a second. And<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that's for last year's technology in a computer industry that is doubling<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
its powers and cost effectiveness every year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope needs is bandwidth and connections. The leading bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and connections people have always been the telephone companies. But when<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope goes to the telephone companies, they want to tell him about<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligence: their Advanced Intelligent Network which will be coming on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
line over the next decade or so and will solve all his problems. For now,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they have what they call DS-3 services available in many areas, operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T-3 lines at 45 megabits (million bits) a second. These facilities are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ample for most computer uses and working together with several different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Hope should be able to acquire<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
these services in time for a General Motors takeover by Toyota.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope has been through this before. In the early 1980s, he actually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wanted D-3 services. Then he was interconnecting facilities in Southeast,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michigan, with plants in Indiana and Ohio. But Michigan Bell could not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply the lines in time. EDS had to build a network of microwave towers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to bear the 45 megabit traffic. Later in the decade, the phone companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have even offered him higher capacity fiber optic lines, with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
requirement that the optical bits be slowed down and run periodically<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through an electronic interface so the telco could count the number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;equivalent channels&quot; being used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope and others in the systems integration business need is not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligent networks tomorrow but dumb bandwidth that they can deliver to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their customers flexibly, cheaply, and now. To prepare for future demand,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they want the network to use fiber optics. It so happens that America's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies have some two million miles of mostly unused fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines in the ground today, kept as redundant capacity for future needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope would like to be able to tap into this &quot;dark fiber&quot; for his
own<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the rapidly expanding field of computer services, EDS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
epitomizes the needs of an information economy. With a backlog of 22<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollars in already contracted business, EDS is currently a seven<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollar company growing revenues at an annual rate of 15 percent,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some three times as fast as the phone companies. EDS will add a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollars or so in new sales in 1992 alone. If the company is to continue
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply leading edge services to its customers, it must command leading edge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications. To EDS, that means dumb and dark networks.<BR>

The &quot;Dark Fiber&quot; Case<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That need has driven EDS into an active role as an ex parte pleader in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Case 911416, currently bogging down in the District of Columbia<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Court of Appeals as the so-called &quot;dark fiber&quot; case. On
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
surface, the case, known as Southwestern Bell et al versus the Federal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department, pits four<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell telephone companies against the FCC. But the legal maneuvers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
actually reflect a rising conflict between the Bells and several large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
corporate clients over the future of communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond all the legal posturing, the question at issue is whether fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks should be dumb and dark, and cheap, the way EDS and other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers like them. Or whether they should be bright and smart, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;strategically&quot; priced, the way the telephone companies want them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the side of intelligence and light are the phone companies;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southwestern Bell, U.S. West, Bell South, and Bell Atlantic. The forces
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
darkness include key officials at the FCC and such companies as Shell Oil,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the information services arm of McDonald Douglas, long distance network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider Wiltel, as well as EDS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For most of the four year course of the struggle, it has passed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unnoticed by the media. In summary, the issue may not seem portentous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The large corporate customers want dark fiber; the FCC mandates that it
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplied; the Bells want out of the business. But for all their obscurity,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the proceedings raise what for the next twenty years will be the central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
issue in communications law and technology. The issue, if not the possible<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trial itself, will shape the future of both the computer and telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries during a period when they are merging to form the spearhead of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dark fiber&quot; is simply a glass fiber optic thread with nothing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
attached to it, (ie. no light being sent through it). In this &quot;unlit&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
condition, it is available for use without the intermediation of phone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company electronics or intelligent services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, the Bells leased some of their dark fiber lines to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
several large corporations on an individual case basis. These companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
learned to love dark fiber. But when they tried to renew their leases with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the Bells, the Bells clanged no! Why don't you leave the interconnections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and protocols to us? Why don't you use our marvellous smart network with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the acronyms and intelligent services? Why don't you let us meter your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
use of the fiber and send you a convenient monthly bill for each packet
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bits you send?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EDS and the other firms rejected the offer; they preferred that dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber to the intelligent network. When the Bells persisted in an effort
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
deny new leases, the companies went to the FCC to require the Bells, as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
regulated &quot;common carrier&quot; telephone companies, to continue supplying
dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the fall of 1990, the FCC ruled that the phone companies would have<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to offer dark fiber to all comers under the rules of common carriage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than accept this new burden, the phone companies petitioned to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
withdraw from the business entirely under what is called a rule 214<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
application. Since the FCC has not acted on this petition, the Bells are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
preparing to go to court to force the issue. Their corporate customers are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ready to litigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is safe to say that none of the participants fully comprehend the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
significance of their courthouse confrontation. To the Bells, after all
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
said and done, the key problem is probably the price. Under the existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
tariff, they are required to offer this service to anyone who wants it for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an average price of approximately $150 per strand of fiber per month. As<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an offering that competes with their T-3 45 megabit (millions of bits) a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second lines and other forthcoming marvels, dark fiber threatens to gobble<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up their future as vendors of broadband communications to offices, even
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cable TV preempts them as broadband providers to homes. Since the Bells'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
profits on data are growing some 10 times as fast as their profits on voice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephony, they see dark fiber as a menace to their most promising markets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The technological portents, however, are far more significant even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than the legal and business issues. The coming triumph of dark fiber will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mean not only the end of the telephone industry as we know it but also the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
end of the telephone industry as they plan it: a vast intelligent fabric<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of sophisticated information services. It also could mean a thoroughgoing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restructuring of a computer industry increasingly dedicated to supplying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;smart networks.&quot; Indeed, for most of the world's communications
companies,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
professors of communications theory, and designers of new computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, the triumph of dark and dumb means &quot;back to the drawing board,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
if not back to the dark ages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the new dark ages cannot be held back.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Springing out the depths of IBM's huge Watson Laboratories is a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powerful new invention: the all optical network, that will soon relegate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all bright and smart executives to the Troglodyte file and make dumb and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dark the winning rule in communications.<BR>

The Wringer Effect<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the structure of nations and economies goes through<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a technological wringer. A new invention radically reduces the price of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
key factor of production and precipitates an industrial revolution. Before<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
long, every competitive business in the economy must wring out the residue<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the old costs and customs from all its products and practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The steam engine, for example, drastically reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
physical force. Power once wreaked at great expense from human and animal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
muscle pulsed cheaply and tirelessly from machines burning coal and oil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the world, dominance inexorably shifted to businesses and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nations that reorganized themselves to exploit the suddenly cheap resource.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually every human industry and activity, from agriculture and sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transport to printing and war, had to centralize and capitalize itself to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
take advantage of the new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Putting the world through the technological wringer over the last<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
three decades has been the integrated circuit, the IC. Invented by Robert<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Noyce of Intel and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1959, the IC put<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire systems of tiny transistor switches, capacitors, resistors, diodes,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and other once costly electronic devices on one tiny microchip. Made<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chiefly of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, three of the most common<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
substances on earth, the microchip eventually reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic circuitry by a factor of a million.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As industry guru Andrew Rappaport has pointed out, electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
designers now treat transistors as virtually free. Indeed, on memory<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chips, they cost some 400 millionths of a cent. To waste time or battery<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power or radio frequencies may be culpable acts, but to waste transistors<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is the essence of thrift. Today you use millions of them slightly to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enhance your TV picture or to play a game of solitaire or to fax Doonsbury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to Grandma. If you do not use transistors in your cars, your offices, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone systems, your design centers, your factories, your farm gear,
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your missiles, you go out of business. If you don't waste transistors,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your cost structure will cripple you. Your product will be either too<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive, too slow, too late, or too low in quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Endowing every information age engineer or PC hacker with the creative<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
potential of a factory owner of the industrial age, the microchip reversed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the centralizing thrust of the previous era. All nations and businesses<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had to adapt to the centrifugal law of the microcosm, flattening<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hierarchies, outsourcing services, liberating engineers, shedding middle<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
management. If you did not adapt your business systems to the new regime,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you would no longer be a factor in the world balance of economic and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
military power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the next decade or so, industry will go through a new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology wringer and submit to a new law: the law of the telecosm. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new wringer, the new integrated circuit, is called the all optical network.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a communications system that runs entirely in glass. Unlike existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optic networks, which convert light signals to electronic form in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
order to amplify or switch them, the all optical network is entirely<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
photonic. From the first conversion of the signal from your phone or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer to the final conversion to voice or data at the destination, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
message flies through glass on wings of light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the old integrated circuit put entire electronic systems on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single slivers of silicon, the new IC will put entire communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems on seamless webs of silica. Wrought in threads as thin as a human<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hair, this silica is so pure that you could see through a window of it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seventy miles thick. But what makes the new wringer roll with all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
force of the microchip revolution before it is not the purity but the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
price. Just as the old IC made transistor power virtually free, the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, the all optical network, will make communications power virtually free.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another word for communications power is bandwidth. Just as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire world had to learn to waste transistors, the entire world will now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to learn how to waste bandwidth. In the 1990s and beyond, every<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry and economy will go through the wringer again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The impact on the organization of companies and economies, however,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has yet to become clear. What is the law of the telecosm? Will the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology reverse the centrifugal force of the microchip revolution...or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
consummate it? To understand the message of the new regime, we must follow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the rule of microcosmic prophet Carver Mead of Caltech: &quot;Listen to
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology...and find out what it is telling us.&quot;<BR>

The Shannon-Shockley Regime<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The father of the all-optical-network, the man who coined the phrase,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
built the first fully functional system, and wrote the definitive book on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the subject, is Paul E. Green, Jr. of Watson Laboratory at IBM. Now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
standing directly in the path of Green's wringer is Robert Lucky, who some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seven years ago at a conference at Cornell first gave Green the idea that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an all optical network might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The leading intellectual in telephony, Lucky recently shocked the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry by shifting from AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, where he was executive director<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of research, to Bellcore, the laboratory of the Regional Bell Operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies (RBOCs). There he will soon have to confront the implications
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's innovation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplating the new technology, Lucky recalls a course on data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks that he used to teach many years ago with Green. As a computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
man, Green relished the contrast between the onrushing efficiencies in his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology and the relative dormancy in communications. Indeed, for some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twenty five years, while computer powers rose a millionfold, network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacities increased about a thousandfold. It was not until the late 1980s<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that most long distance data networks much surpassed the Pentagon's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ARPANET&quot; running at 50 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second
since the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mid sixties.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was the era dominated by the powerful mathematic visions and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
theories of Claude Shannon of MIT and Bell Labs. Shannon was the reclusive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
genius who invented Information Theory to ascertain the absolute carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity of any communications channel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether wire or air, channels were assumed to be narrow and noisy, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way God made them (sometimes with help from AT&amp;T). Typical were the
copper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone lines that still link every household to the telephone network and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the air waves that still bear radio and television signals and static.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all-purpose remedy for these narrow, noisy channels was powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Invented at Bell Laboratories by a team headed by William<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shockley and then developed by Robert Noyce and other Shockley proteges
in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley, silicon transistors and integrated circuits engendered a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
constant exponential upsurge of computing power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throwing ever more millions of ever faster and cheaper transistors at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every problem, engineers created fast computers, multiplexors, and switches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that seemed to surmount and outsmart every limit of bandwidth or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restriction of wire. This process continues today with heroic new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression tools that allow the creation of full video conferences over
64<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilobit telephone connections. Scientists at Bellcore are now even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
proposing new ways of using the Motion Picture Engineering Group (MPEG)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression standard to send full motion movies at 1.5 megabits a second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
over the 4 kilohertz twisted pair copper wires to the home. Using ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
faster computers, the telephone company is saying it can give you pay-per-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
view movies without installing fiber, or even coaxial cable, to the home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Shannon-Shockley era, the communications might be noisy and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
error prone, but smart electronics could encode and decode messages in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
complex ways that allowed efficient identification and correction of all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
errors. The Shannon channel might be narrow, but fast multiplexors allowed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it to be divided into time slots accommodating a large number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simultaneous users in a system called time division multiplexing. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
channel might clog up when large numbers of users attempted to communicate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with each other at once, but collision detectors or token passers could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sort it all out in nanoseconds. Graphics and video might impose immense<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods of bits on the system, but compression technology could reduce the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods to a manageable trickle with little or no loss of picture quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If all else failed, powerful electronic switches could compensate for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
almost any bandwidth limitations. Switching could make up for the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inadequate bandwidth at the terminals by relieving the network of the need<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to broadcast all signals to every destination. Instead, the central switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could receive all signals and then route them to their appropriate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, this is the essential strategy of the telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies: compensate for narrow noisy bandwidth with ever more powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and intelligent digital electronics. Their &quot;core competence,&quot;
the Bells<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hasten to tell you, is switching. They make up for the shortcomings of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
copper wires by providing smart, powerful digital switches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Their vision for the future is to join the computer business all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way, making these switches the entering wedge for ever more elaborate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information services. Switches will grow smarter and more sophisticated<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
until they provide an ever growing cornucopia of intelligent voice and fax<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
features, from caller ID and voice mail to personal communications systems<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that follow you and your number around the world from your car commute to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your vacation beach hideaway. In the end, these intelligent networks could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply virtually all the world's information needs, from movies, games and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
traffic updates to data libraries, financial services, news programs, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
weather reports, all climaxing with yellow pages that exfoliate into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigantic global mall of full motion video where your fingers walk (or your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
voice commands echo) from Harrods, to Jardines, to Akihabara, to Century
21<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
without you leaving the couch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the time when Green and Lucky taught their course, this strategy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for the future was only a glimmer in the minds of telephone visionaries.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the essence of it was already in place. As Green pointed out,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies' response to sluggishness in communications was to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enter the computer industry, where progress was faster. The creativity of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
digital electronics would save the telephone industry from technical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stagnation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky, however, protested to Green that it was unjust to compare the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two fields. Computers and telecom, as Lucky explained it, operate on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entirely different scales. Computers work in the microscale world of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, putting ever more thousands of wires and switches on single slivers
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
silicon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, telecommunications functions in the macroworld, laying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
out wires and switches across mostly silicon landscapes and seabeds. It<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
necessarily entails a continental, or even intercontinental stretch of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cables, microwave towers, switches, and poles. &quot;How was it possible,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky asked, &quot;to make such a large scale system inexpensive?&quot;
Inherent in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the structure and even the physics of computers and telecommunications,
so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it seemed to Lucky two decades ago, was a communications bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Lucky remembers it, Green was never satisfied with Lucky's point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green believed that someday communications could achieve miracles<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to the integrated circuit in computing....<BR>

The Bandwidth Scandal<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, as Lucky was the first to announce, fiber optics has utterly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
overthrown the previous relationship between fast computers and slow wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it is computer technology that imposes the bottleneck on the vast<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vistas of dark fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A silicon transistor can change its state some 2.5 billion times a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second in response to light pulses (bundles of photons) hitting a photo-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
detector. Since it would take a human being a thousand years or so of 10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hour workdays even to count to two billion, two billion cycles in a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second (two gigahertz) might seem a sprightly pace. But in the world of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optics running at the speed and frequencies of light, even a rate
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two billion cycles a second is a humbling bow to the slothful pace of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Since optical signals still have to be routed to their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
destinations through computer switches, communications now suffers from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what is known as the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is this electronic bottleneck, the entire Bell edifice of Shannon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and Shockley, that Paul Green plans to blow away with his all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks. Green is targeting what is a secret scandal of modern<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecommunications: the huge gap between the real capacity of fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and the actual speed of telephone communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In communications systems, the number of waves per second (or hertz)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
represents a rough measure of its potential bandwidth or ultimate carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity. The bandwidth of a radio system, for example, is determined by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the frequency of each station or channel and by the number of stations that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
can fit within the band. Your AM dial, for example, runs from around 535<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand hertz (kilohertz) to 1705 kilohertz and each station uses some
10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilohertz. With an ideal receiver, the AM passband might carry 117<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some 25 thousand gigahertz in each of three groups of frequencies (three<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands) through which fiber can transmit light over long distances. At<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a gigahertz per terminal, this bandwidth might accommodate some 25,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supercomputer &quot;stations&quot; (or 2.5 billion AM stations). Using what
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
called dispersion shifted fiber, it may be possible to use two of these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands at once: a total of some 40 or 50 thousand gigahertz. For<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparison, consider all the radio frequencies currently used in the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for radio, television, microwave, and satellite communications and multiply<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by two thousand. The bandwidth of one fiber thread could carry more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two thousand times as much information as all these radio and microwave<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies that currently comprise the &quot;air.&quot; One fiber thread
could bear<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twice the traffic on the phone network during the peak hour of Mothers'
Day<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in the U.S. (the heaviest load currently managed by the phone system).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet even for point-to-point long distance links, let alone connections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to homes, telephone and computer network engineers now turn their backs
on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
this immense capacity and use perhaps one or two fifty thousandths it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deferring to the electronic bottleneck, the telephone industry uses fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
merely as a superior replacement for the copper wires, coaxial cables,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
satellite links, and microwave towers that connected the local central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
office switches to one another for long distance calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last 15 years, the Bell Laboratory record for fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication has run from 10 megabits per second over a one kilometer span<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to some 10 gigabits per second over nearly one thousand kilometers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the heroic advances in point-to-point links between central offices<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
continued to use essentially one frequency on a fiber thread, while<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoring its intrinsic power to accommodate thousands of useful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In a world of all optical networks, this strategy is bankrupt. No<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
longer will it be possible to throw more transistors, however cheap and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fast, at the switching problem. Electronic speeds have become an<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
insuperable bottleneck obstructing the vast vistas of dark fiber beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So called gigabit networks planned by the telephone and computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies will not do. What is needed is not a gigabit spread among many<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals, but a large network functioning at a gigabit per second per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demands of EDS offer a hint of the most urgent business needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Added to them will be consumer demands. True high definition television,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to movies in resolution, requires close to gigabit-a-second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, particularly if the program is dispatched to the viewer in burst<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mode all at once in a few seconds down the fiber, or if the user is given
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chance to shape the picture, choose a vantage point, window several images<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at once, or experience three dimensions. When true broadband channels<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
become available, there will be a flood of new applications comparable to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the thousands of new uses of the IC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No foreseeable progress in electronics can overcome the electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bottleneck. To do that, we need an entirely new communications regime. In<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the form of the all optical network, this regime is now at hand.<BR>

Law Of The Telecosm: Networks Dumb As A Stone<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime will use fiber not as a replacement for copper wires<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but as a new form of far more capacious and error-free air. Through a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
system called wavelength division multiplexing and access, computers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephones will tune into desired messages in the fibersphere the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios now tune into desired signals in the atmosphere. The fibersphere<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be intrinsically as dumb and dark as the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime overcomes the electronic bottleneck by altogether<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
banishing electronics from the network. But, ask the telcos in unison,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what about the switches? As long as the network is switched, it must be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
partly electronic. Unless the network is switched, it is not a true any-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to-any network. It is a broadcast system. It may offer a cornucopia of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services. But it cannot serve as a common carrier like the phone network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
allowing any party to reach any other. Without intelligent switching it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cannot provide personal communications nets that can follow you wherever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you go. Without intelligent switching, the all optical network, so they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
say, is just a glorified cable system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These critics fail to grasp a central rule of the telecosm: bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is a nearly perfect substitute for switching. With sufficient physical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it is possible to simulate any kind of logical switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
whatsoever. Bandwidth allows creation of virtual switches that to the user<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seem to function exactly the way physical switches do. You can send all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
messages everywhere in the network, include all needed codes and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
instructions for correcting, decrypting, and reading them, and allow each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength, just like
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two-way radio. When the terminals are smart enough and the bandwidth great<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enough, your all optical network can be as dumb as a stone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last several years, all optical network experiments have been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conducted around the world, from Bellcore in New Jersey to NTT at Yokosuka,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Japan. British Telecom has used wavelength division multiplexing to link<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
four telephone central offices in London. Columbia's Telecom Center has<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launched a &quot;Teranet&quot; that lacks tunable lasers or receivers but
can<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
logically simulate them. Bell Laboratories has generated most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology but as a long distance specialist has focussed on the project
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sending gigabits of information thousands of miles without amplifiers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only fully functional system is the Rainbow created by Paul Green at IBM.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As happens so often in this a world of technical disciplines sliced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
into arbitrary fortes and fields, the large advances come from the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrators. Paul Green is neither a laser physicist, nor an optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
engineer, nor a telecommunications theorist. At IBM, his work has ranged<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
from overseeing speech recognition projects at Watson Labs to shaping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company strategy at corporate headquarters in Armonk. His most recent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
success was supervising development of the new APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Network) protocol. According to an IBM announcement in March, APPN will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
replace the venerable SNA (systems network architecture) that has been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
synonymous with IBM networking for more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green took some pride in this announcement, but by that time, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
project was long in his past. He was finishing the copy editing on his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
magisterial tome on Fiber Optic Networks (published this summer by Prentice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hall). And he was moving on to more advanced versions of the Rainbow which<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
he and his team had introduced in December 1991 at the Telecom 91<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Conference in Geneva and which has been installed between the various<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
branches of Watson Laboratories in Westchester County, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker points out, a new technology cannot displace an old<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
one unless it is proven at least 10 times better. Otherwise the billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of installed base and thousands of engineers committed
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
improving the old technology will suffice to block the new one. The job
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Green's 15 man team at IBM is to meet that tenfold test.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's all optical network creates a fibersphere as neutral and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passive as the atmosphere. It can be addressed by computers the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios and television sets connect to the air. Consisting entirely of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unpowered glass and passive spitters and couplers, the fibersphere is dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dumb. Any variety of terminals can interconnect across it at the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time using any protocols they choose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as radios in the atmosphere, computer receivers connected to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere do not find a series of bits in a message; they tune into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wavelength or frequency. Because available Fabry Perot tunable filters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
today have larger bandwidth than tunable lasers, Green chose to locate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rainbow's tuning at the receiver and have transmitters each operate at a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fixed wavelength. But future networks can use any combination of tunable<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
equipment at either end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Green began the project in 1987, the industry stood in the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
general position as the pioneers of radio in the early years of that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry. They had seemingly unlimited bandwidth before them, but lacked<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters and receivers powerful enough to use it effectively. Radio<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters suffered &quot;splitting losses&quot; as they broadcast their
signals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
across the countryside. Green's optical messages lose power everytime they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are split off to be sent to another terminal or are tapped by a receiver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The radio industry solved this problem by the development of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
audion triode amplifier. Green needed an all optical amplifier to replace<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the optoelectronic repeaters that now constitute the most widespread<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic bottleneck in fiber. Amplifiers in current fiber networks first<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert the optical signal to an electronic signal, enhance it, and then<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert it back to photons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the pioneers of radio, Green soon had his amplifier in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following concepts pioneered by David Payne at the University of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southhampton in England, a Bell Laboratories group led by Emmanuel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Desurvire and Randy Giles developed a workable all optical device. They<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
showed that a short stretch of fiber doped with erbium, a rare earth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mineral, and excited by a cheap laser diode, can function as a powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier over the entire wavelength range of a 25,000 gigahertz system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today such photonic amplifiers enhance signals in a working system of links<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between Naples and Pomezia on the west coast of Italy. Manufactured in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
packages between two and three cubic inches in size, these amplifiers fit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
anywhere in an optical network for enhancing signals without electronics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This invention overcame the most fundamental disadvantage of optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks compared to electronic networks. You can tap into an electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
network as often as desired without weakening the voltage signal. Although<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
resistance and capacitance will weaken the current, there are no splitting<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
losses in a voltage divider. Photonic signals, by contrast, suffer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
splitting losses every time they are tapped; they lose photons until<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
eventually there are none left. The cheap and compact all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier solves this problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Not only did Green and his IBM colleagues create working all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, they also reduced the interface optoelectronics to a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microchannel plug-in card that can fit in any IBM PS/2 level personal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer or R6000 workstation. Using off-the-shelf components costing a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
total of $16,000 per station, Rainbow achieved a capacity more than 90<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
times greater than FDDI at an initial cost merely four times as much.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Jack Kilby's first ICs were not better than previous adders<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and oscillators, the Rainbow I is not better in some respects than rival<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks based on electronics. At present it connects only 32 computers
at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a speed of some 300 megabits per second, for a total bandwidth of 9.5<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigabits. This rate is huge compared to most other networks, but it is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
still well below the target of a system that provides gigabit rates for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A more serious limitation is the lack of packet switching. Rather<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than communicating down a dedicated connection between two parties, like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phones do, computer networks send data in small batches, called packets,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
each bearing its own address. This requires switching back and forth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between packets millions of times a second. Neither the current Rainbow's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lasers nor its filters can tune from one message to another more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of times a second. This limitation is a serious problem for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
links to mainframes and supercomputers that may do many tasks at once in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
different windows on the screen and with connections to several other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Green shows, however, all these problems are well on the way to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
solution. A tide of new interest in all optical systems is sweeping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the world's optical laboratories. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a program for all optical networking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Green installed as the new President of the IEEE Communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Society, the technical journals are full of articles on new wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division technology. Every few months brings new reports of a faster laser<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with a broader bandwidth, or filter with faster tuning, or an ingenious
new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way to use bandwidth to simulate packet switching. Today lasers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
receivers can switch fast enough but they still lack the ability to cover<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the entire bandwidth needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key point, however, is that as demonstrated both in Geneva and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armonk, the Green system showed the potential efficiency of all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Even in their initial forms they are more cost effective in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth per dollar than any other network technology. Scheduled for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
introduction within the next two years, Rainbow III will comprise a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand stations operating at a gigabit a second, with the increasingly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
likely hope of fast packet switching capability. At that point, the system<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be a compelling commercial product at least hundreds of times more<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost effective than the competition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Without access to dark fiber, however, these networks will be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
worthless. If the telephone companies fail to supply it, they risk losing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
most of the fastest growing parts of their business: the data traffic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
which already contributes some 50 percent of their profits. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
also a possibility that they will lose much of their potential consumer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
business as well: the planned profits in pay-per-view films and electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yellow pages. This is the message of a second great prophet of dark fiber,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will Hicks of Southbridge, Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A venerable inventor of scores of optical products, Hicks believes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that Green's view of the future of fiber is too limited. Using wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division, Hicks can see the way to deliver some 500 megahertz two-way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
connections to all the homes in America for some $400 per home. That is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fifty times the 10 megahertz total capacity of an Ethernet (with no one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
else using it) for some 20 percent of the cost. That is capacity in each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
home for twenty digital two-way HDTV channels at once at perhaps half the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost of new telephone connections. Then, after a large consumer market<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
emerges for fiber optics, Hicks believes, Green's sophisticated computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services will follow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The consumer market, Hicks maintains, is the key to lowering the cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the components to a level where they can be widely used in office<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks as well. He cites the example of the compact disk laser diode.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once lasers were large and complex devices, chilled with liquid nitrogen,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and costing thousands of dollars; now they are as small as a grain of salt,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cheap as a box of cereal, and more numerous than phonograph needles. An<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
executive at Hitachi told Hicks that Hitachi could work a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation on laser diodes and amplifiers for all optical networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just tell me what price you want to pay and I'll tell you how many
you<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to buy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The divergence of views between the IBM executive and the wildcat<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inventor, however, is far less significant than their common vision of dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber as the future of communications. By the power of ever cheaper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it will transform all industries of the coming information age<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
just as radically as the power of cheaper transistors transformed the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries of the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the telephone companies, the age of ever smarter terminals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mandates the emergence of ever dumber networks. This is a major strategic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge; it takes a smart man to build a dumb network. But the telcos<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have the best laboratories and have already developed nearly all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
components of the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Telephone companies may complain of the large costs of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation of their system, but they command capital budgets as large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as the total revenues of the cable industry. Telcos may recoil in horror<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at the idea of dark fiber, but they command webs of the stuff ten times<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
larger than any other industry. Dumb and dark networks may not fit the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company self-image or advertising posture. But they promise larger<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
markets than the current phone company plan to choke off their future in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the labyrinthine nets of an &quot;intelligent switching fabric&quot; always
behind<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
schedule and full of software bugs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telephone companies cannot expect to impose a uniform network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
governed by universal protocols. The proliferation of digital protocols<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and interfaces is an inevitable effect of the promethean creativity of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer industry. Green explains, &quot;You cannot fix the protocol zoo.
You<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
must use bandwidth to accommodate the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Robert Pokress, a former switch designer at Bell Labs now head of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unifi Corporation, points out, telephone switches (now 80 percent software)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are already too complex to keep pace with the efflorescence of relatively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simple computer technology on their periphery. While computers become ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more lean and mean, turning to reduced instruction set processors, networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
need to adopt reduced instruction set architectures. The ultimate in dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dark is the fibersphere now incubating in their magnificent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The entrepreneurial folk in the computer industry may view this<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wrenching phone company adjustment with some satisfaction. But the fact
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that computer companies face a strategic reorientation as radical as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telcos do. In a world where ever smarter terminals require ever dumber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications, computer networks are as gorged and glutted with smarts
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company networks and even less capacious. The nation's most<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
brilliant nerds, commanding the 200 MIPS Silicon Graphics superstations
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mac Quadra multimedia power plants, humbly kneel before the 50 kilobit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines of the Internet and beseech the telcos to upgrade to 64 kilobit basic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ISDN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now addicted to the use of transistors to solve the problems of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limited bandwidth, the computer industry must use transistors to exploit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the opportunities of nearly unlimited bandwidth. When home-based machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are optimized for manipulating high resolution digital video at high<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speeds, they will necessarily command what are now called supercomputer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powers. This will mean that the dominant computer technology will emerge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
first not in the office market but in the consumer market. The major<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge for the computer industry is to change its focus from a few<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hundred million offices already full of computer technology to a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
living rooms now nearly devoid of it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies possess the advantage of already owning dumb networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
based on the essentials of the all optical model of broadcast and select--<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of customers seeking wavelengths or frequencies rather than switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
circuits. Cable companies already provide all the programs to all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals and allow them to tune in to the desired messages. Uniquely in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the world, U.S. cable firms already offer a broadband pipe to ninety<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
percent of American homes. These coaxial cables, operating at one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigahertz for several hundred feet, provide the basis for two way broadband<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services today. But the cable industry cannot become a full service<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplier of telecommunications until it changes its self-image from a cheap<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider of one way entertainment services into a common carrier of two
way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Above all, the cable industry cannot succeed in the digital<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
age if it continues to regard the personal computer as an alien and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
irrelevant machine.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Analogous to the integrated circuit in its economic power, the all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optical network is analogous to the massively parallel computer in its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technical paradigm. In the late 1980s in computers, the effort to make one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor function ever faster on a serial stream of data reached a point<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of diminishing returns. Superpipelining and superscalar gains hit their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limits. Despite experiments with Josephson Junctions, high electron<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mobility, and cryogenics, usable transistors simply could not made to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
switch much faster than a few gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Computer architects responded by creating machines with multiple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processors operating in parallel on multiple streams of data. While each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor worked more slowly than the fastest serial processors, thousands<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of slow processors in parallel could far outperform the fastest serial<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Measured by cost effectiveness, the massively parallel machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dwarfed the performance of conventional supercomputers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same pattern arose in communications and for many of the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
reasons. In the early 1990s the effort to increase the number of bits that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could be time division multiplexed down a fiber on a single frequency band<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had reached a point of diminishing returns. Again the switching speed of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transistors was the show stopper. The architects of all optical networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
responded by creating systems which can use not one wavelength or frequency<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but potentially thousands in parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the new systems could not outperform time division multiplexing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
on one frequency. But all optical networks opened up a vast vista of some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
75 thousand gigahertz of frequencies potentially usable for communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That immense potential of massively parallel frequencies left all methods<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of putting more bits on a single set of frequencies look as promising as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launching computers into the chill of outer space in order to accelerate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their switching speeds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the law of the microcosm made all terminals smart,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
distributing intelligence from the center to the edges of the network, so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the law of the telecosm creates a network dumb enough to accommodate the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
incredible onrush of intelligence on its periphery. Indeed, with the one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chip supercomputer on the way, manufacturable for under a hundred dollars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
toward the end of the decade, the law of the microcosm is still gaining<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
momentum. The fibersphere complements the promise of ubiquitous computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power with equally ubiquitous communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What happens, however, when not only transistors but also wires are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nearly free? As Robert Lucky observes in his forward to Paul Green's book,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of us have been conditioned to think that transmission is inherently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive; that we should use switching and processing wherever possible
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
minimize transmission.&quot; This is the law of the microcosm. But as Lucky<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speculates, &quot;The limitless bandwidth of fiber optics changes these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assumptions. Perhaps we should transmit signals thousands of miles to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
avoid even the simplest processing function.&quot; This is the law of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecosm: use bandwidth to simplify everything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Hillis of Thinking Machines Corporation offers a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vision, adding to Lucky's insight the further assertion that massively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
parallel computer architectures are so efficient that they can overthrow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the personal computer revolution. Hillis envisages a powerplant computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
model, with huge Thinking Machines at the center tapped by millions of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively dumb terminals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these speculations assume that the Law of the Telecosm usurps the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Law of the Microcosm. But in fact the two concepts function in different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ways in different domains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transistors use electrons to control, amplify, or switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons. But photonics differ radically from electronics. Because<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moving photons do not affect one another on contact, they cannot readily
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
used to control, amplify, or switch each other. Compared to electrons,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moreover, photons are huge: infrared photons at 1550 or 1300 nanometers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are larger than a micron across. They resist the miniaturization of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microcosm. For computing, photons are far inferior to electrons. With<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single electron electronics now in view, electrons will keep their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
advantage. For the foreseeable future, computers will be made with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are crippling flaws for photonic computing, however, are huge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assets for communicating. Because moving photons do not collide with each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
other or respond to electronic charges, they are inherently a two way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
medium. They are immune to lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrical power surges that destroy electronic equipment. Virtually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
noiseless and massless pulses of radiation, they move as fast and silently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Listening to the technology, as Caltech prophet Carver Mead<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
recommends, one sees a natural division of labor between photonics and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Photonics will dominate communications and electronics will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dominate computing. The two technologies do not compete; they are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
beautiful complements of each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm makes distributed computers (smart terminals)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more efficient regardless of the cost of linking them together. The law
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the telecosm makes dumb and dark networks more efficient regardless of how<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
numerous and smart are the terminals. Working together, however, these two<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laws of wires and switches impel ever more widely distributed information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the narrow bandwidth of current phone company connections that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
explains the persistence of centralized computing in a world of distributed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Narrowband connections require smart interfaces and complex<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
protocols and expensive data. Thus you get your online information from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only a few databases set up to accommodate queries over the phone lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You limit television broadcasting to a few local stations. Using the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively narrowband phone network or television system, it pays to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
concentrate memory and processing at one point and tap into the hub from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of remote locations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Using a broadband fiber system, by contrast, it will pay to distribute<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
memory and services to all points on the network. Broadband links will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
foster specialization. If the costs of communications are low, databases,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
libraries, and information services can specialize and be readily reached<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by customers from anywhere. On line services lose the economies of scale<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that lead a firm such as Dialog to attempt to concentrate most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
world's information in one set of giant archives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By making bandwidth nearly free, the new integrated circuit of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere will radically change the environment of all information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries and technologies. In all eras, companies tend to prevail by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maximizing the use of the cheapest resources. In the age of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere, they will use the huge intrinsic bandwidth of fiber, all 25<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand gigahertz or more, to replace nearly all the hundreds of billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of switches, bridges, routers, converters, codecs,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compressors, error correctors, and other devices, together with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trillions of lines of software code, that pervade the intelligent switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fabric of both telephone and computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The makers of all this equipment will resist mightily. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
no chance that the old regime can prevail by fighting cheap and simple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optics with costly and complex electronics and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical network will triumph for the same reason that the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrated circuit triumphed: it is incomparably cheaper than the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competition. Today, measured by the admittedly rough metric of MIPS per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollar, a personal computer is more than one thousand times more cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
effective than a mainframe. Within 10 years, the all optical network will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
be millions of times more cost effective than electronic networks. Just
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the electron rules in computers, the photon will rule the waves of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical ideal will not immediately usurp other technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Vacuum tubes reached their highest sales in the late 1970s. But just as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the IC inexorably exerted its influence on all industries, the all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology will impart constant pressure on all other communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Every competing system will have to adapt to its cost structure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, almost all electronic communications will go through the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wringer and emerge in glass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is the real portent of the dark fiber case wending its way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the courts. The future of the information age depends on the rise<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dumb and dark networks to accommodate the onrush of ever smarter<BR>

The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one huge fact: Without
immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a world power. Without immigration,
the U.S. could not have produced the computerized weapons that induced the
Soviet Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the U.S.
could not have built the atomic bomb during World War II, or the hydrogen
bomb in the early 1950s, or the MIRVs in the 1970s or the cruise missiles
for the Gulf War in the 1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military projects but
also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures in an information age economy.
No less than military superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance
and high standards of living today depend on outsiders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every high-technology company, big or small is like a Manhattan Project.
All must mobilize the personnel best trained and most able to perform a
specific function, and deliver a product within a window of opportunity
as fateful and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to the
small elite of human beings in the world capable of pioneering these new
scientific and engineering frontiers. For many specialized high-technology
tasks, the pool of potential talent around the world numbers about 10 people,
or even fewer. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
The Right People </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are running such a technology company, you will quickly discover
that the majority of this cognitive elite are not citizens of your country.
Unless you can find the right people wherever they may be, you will not
be able to launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless you
can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any other jobs at
all, and your country will forgo the cycle of new products, skills, and
businesses that sustain a world-leading standard of living. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their followers are
beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the movement of cabbage pickers and au
pair girls and the possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like
hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex crouching behind
them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as George Borjas of the University
of California, San Diego, and artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude
that the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or negligible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the evidence in overwhelming and undeniable; it is all around us,
in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from microwaves and air
bags to digital cable and satellite television, from home computers and
air conditioners to cellular phones and life saving pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. Without immigration over the last 50 years, I would estimate
that the U.S. real living standards would be at least 40% lower. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems from a basic
flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail to account for the indispensable
qualitative effects of genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability
to generate unique products and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses
are literally thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We
all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify or predict, except
in retrospect. But judging from the very rough metric of awards of mathematical
doctorates and other rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes,
patents, and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. are
foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of immigrants. A third of
all American Nobel Prize winners, for example were born overseas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A stellar example of these elates in action is Silicon Valley in California.
Silicon Valley companies have reduced the price of computer MIPs and memory
bits by a factor of some 10,000 in 2 1/2 decades. Although mainstream economists
neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these innovations, most of
the new value in the world economy over the last decade has stemmed, directly
or indirectly, from the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware
and software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel
developed the basic processes of microchip manufacture and created dynamic
and static random access memory. In other words, Intel laid the foundations
for the personal computer revolution and scores of other chip-bases industries
that employ the vast bulk of U.S. engineers today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two American born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were key founders
of Fairchild and Intel. But their achievements would have been impossible
without the help of Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-Benchkowski,
inventor of electrically erasable programmable ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor
of silicon gate technology and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi
Shima, layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course Andrew
Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved several intractable problems
of the metal oxide silicon technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All
these Intel engineers - and hundreds of other key contributors - were immigrants.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon Valley, from National
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic,
Actel, Atmel, Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the outset heavily depended on immigrants
in the laboratories and on engineering work benches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel,
Xicor, and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully one-third
of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. economy, with
Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even Alleys being hopefully launched
from Manhattan to Oregon, immigration becomes ever more vital to the future
of the U.S. economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the foundation
of silicon have arisen world-leading software and medical equipment industries
almost equally dependent on immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing
U.S. industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted jobs
in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still must turn to immigrants
for 5% of its domestic work force, despite the difficult and expensive legal
procedures required to import an alien. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
Freedom of Enterprise </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a Microsoft attorney,
declared that immigration bars could jeopardize the 58% of its revenue generated
overseas, threaten American dominance of advance &quot;client-server&quot;
business applications, and render &quot;stillborn&quot; the information
superhighway. In particular, Corning and other producers of fiber-optic
technology have faced a severe shortage of native engineers equipped to
pursue this specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning mathematics and the
hard sciences, America is the global technology and economic leader in spite
of, not because of , any properties of the American gene pool or dominant
culture. America prevails only because it offers the freedom of enterprise
and innovation to people from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress is contemplating,
is a decision to wreck the key element of the American technological miracle.
After botching the issues of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction,
and wasting a year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget,
the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body blow to the
intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must not cripple the new Manhattan
Projects of the U.S. economy in order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic
dream of ethnic purity and autarky.

<H5><A HREF="dispfthr.html">Read a response to this article by <BR>
Washington Post columnist William Raspberry</A></H5>
<BR>
<HR>Dinesh D'Souza is currently the perplexed benificiary and victim of
an uproar over his book <I>&quot;The End of Racism,&quot;</I> which emerged
in the midst of a momentous furor over the centrality of race in America.
Except for the always bravely Olympian sage Thomas Sowell, even conservative
blacks have fiercely renounced much of his argument along with his intemperate
language. How can anyone deny the power of racism in the face of the taped
ruminations of Mark Fuhrman, the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan the indignant
voices at the Million Man March, the radical split between the races reacting
to the acquittal of O.J. Simpson? <BR>
<BR>
I know how Mr. D'Souza feels. In 1979, I published a book called <I>&quot;Visible
Man: A True Story of Post Racist American.&quot;</I> Now this book is being
republished by the ICS Press in San Francisco. <I><A HREF="visible.html">&quot;Visible
Man&quot;</A></I> showed that white racism was not a significant problem
for American blacks in the late 1970's. If white racism was not much of
a problem in 1978, it is manifestly not a problem in 1995. <BR>
<H4>Black Achievement </H4>
<BR>
Neither I nor Mr. D'Souza denies the existence of racial feelings in America
and throughout the world. But far from being hostile to black achievement,
American whites celebrate blacks at every opportunity. In the truest test,
governed by messive voluntary choices in the marketplace, Americans have
made the National Basketball Association, 80% black, the most popular sports
league, Whitney Houston the most popular and richest American singer, Bill
Cosby the most popular and richest comedian, and Oprah Winfrey the most
prosperous entertainer. Far from showing racism, American employers, mostly
white, have given black women higher earnings, on average, than comparable
white women. Between 1973 and 1994, the current-dollar revenues of the top
100 black owned industrial companies, as listed by <I>Black Enterprise</I>
magazine, rose from $473 million to $6.7 billion, plus $4.9 billion in revenues
from auto dealerships. Blacks in America have far outperformed blacks in
any other society with a substantial black population. <BR>
<BR>
In my view, the most important finding in <I>&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;</I>
by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray was that after controlling for
age, IQ and gender, the average full-time worker actually out-earns the
average white by 1%. Let the IQ number stand for real educational attainment
(as opposed to degrees in easier subjects and from less rigorous institutions),
and it is clear that racial discrimination no longer limits black earnings.
A more appropriate standard, though, would include a correction for marital
status, since married men of all races earn some 30% more than single men
of the same age and credentials. Correcting the Murray figures for marital
status gives black men a dramatic edge in earnings over white men. Although
such comparisons are full of pitfalls, it is safe to say that black men
in the U.S. today earn more, not less, than truly comparable whites. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than admit this reality, the intelligentsia, black and white, would
rather pusue fantasies of racial hatred. As I discovered during appearances
related to the original publication of <I>&quot;Visible Man,&quot;</I> and
as Mr. D'Souza is now learning, denial of racism today is widely seen as
evidence of it. In the face of the fury of the charges of bigotry, whites
find it easier to go along than to tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Public opinion polls, for example, show that the beating of Rodney King
galvanized a newly intense feeling of alienation among blacks in America.
Yet anyone, regardless of race, who took the police on an eight- mile, high-speed
chase, and then charged at them at the end, should be grateful if he is
not shot (rather than beaten). Sensible people learn not to defy or insult
police officers who are performing an inevitably messy and treacherous job
under tremendous strain. Yet the white media almost unanimously confirmed
the black outrage. Today whites indulge the idea of reasonable doubt in
the Simpson trial, as if it were possible that a team of policemen would
or could contrive an instant frame-up of a supremely popular black athelete.
<BR>
<BR>
In effect, all America treats blacks as children who cannot be told the
truth. From Harvard Law School deans to ghetto social workers; from the
chairman of the New York Times to the editors of Time magazine, to the steady
drumbeat of three broadcast networks, eminent whites are constantly confirming
blacks in the crippling comfort of their belief in white racism. <BR>
<BR>
If racism explains next to nothing about black poverty and crime, what does
explain it? What is the real cause, so unspeakably unwelcome that it drives
opinion toward almost any other explanation, however false or unsavory?
The chief cause of black poverty is welfare state feminism. Thirty years
of affirmative action programs have artificially elevated black women into
economic power over black men. <BR>
<BR>
This regime prevailed from the highest levels of the economy, where black
female college graduates with five years on the job significantly outearned
black men in 1991, to the underclass, where a typical package of welfare
benefits produced disposable income 28% above a typical job in 1994. It
prevailed on college campuses, where more than 60% of the blacks are women.
It dominated government job training programs, where girls are found to
benefit far more than boys. It even invaded such male bastions as the cockpits
of fighter planes, police squad cars, fire stations, construction sites
and university athletic teams. In a grotesque abuse of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, judges have interpreted Title IX of the 1972 amendments as
requiring academic institutions, in effect, to retrench scholarships and
opportunities for superior black male athletes to advance the careers of
measurably inferior female athletes, white and black, soley on the basis
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
It is an unpopular fact of life that in all societies and in all races monogamous
marriage is based on patriarchal sex roles, with men the dominant provider.
Welfare state feminism destroyed black families by ravaging the male role
of provider. <BR>
<BR>
Some observers claim that black communities benefit from matriarchal institutions.
Looking more closely, however, you will find inner cities implacably ruled
by gangs of young men, with the &quot;matriarchs&quot; cowering in their
triple bolted apartments in fear of them. <BR>
<BR>
Men either dominate as providers or predators. There is hardly any other
option. The key problem of the underclass - the crucible of crime, the source
of violence, the root of poverty - is the utter failure of socialization
of young men through marriage. The problem resides in the nexus of men and
marriage. Yet nearly all the attention, subsidies, training opportunities
and therapies of the welfare state focus on helping women function without
marriage. The welfare state attacks the problem of the absence of husbands
by rendering husbands as entirely superfluous. &quot;Welfare reform&quot;
continues the policy giving welfare mothers new training and child care
benefits and further obviating marriage by pursuing unmarried fathers with
deadbeat dad campaigns. <BR>
<BR>
Today, in large American cities, fully 40% of young black men between the
ages of 17 and 35 are in prison, on probation, or on the lam; and some 40%
of young black women say they have been forced into unwanted sexual activity.
To fear young black males has become a mandate for survival on the streets
of many American cities. This unspeakable social tragedy - with all its
infuriating reverberations on law-abiding balck citizens - is the inevitavble
harvest of government policy. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>The Great Fiasco </H4>
<BR>
Even Margaret Mead recognized that in all cultures family values depend
on religious supports and male providers. The effort to unculcate ethical
behavior and sustain marriage without religious faith is the great fiasco
of the modern age. In order to relieve the pain of the poor, our soicety
must come to recognize that their problem is not lack of jobs or lack of
money but moral anarchy originating with the establishment and most sorely
victimizing blacks. <BR>
<BR>
With both the black and white establishments and even the leading Christian
churches succumbing to the siren appeal of unisex policy, what could be
more predictable than the emergence of patriarchal religion - however offensive
in some ways - as a galvanizing force among black men. If Mr. Farrakhan
is deeply culpable for his ethnic fanaticism, surely the entire U.S. establishment
is equally culpable for its fanatical assault on family roles. For all races,
patriarchal religion has played a central role in human civilization. Patriarchal
black churches, from Father Divines' mid-century movement to Christian fundamentalists
and Black muslims today - have served more as part of the solution than
as part of the problem of black poverty. <BR>
<BR>
These lessons have become increasingly relevant to whites who imagine that
they can sustain a civilization based on secular liberation from monogamous
sex roles. As the white illegitimacy rate moves toward the level reached
by blacks at the time of the Moynihan Report - and decisively surpasses
it in Britain - the events of recent weeks should ring a tocsin for all
Americans. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
What's wrong with welfare? Here's an answer you haven't heard: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key problem of the welfare culture is not unemployed women with
illegitimate children. It is the women's skewed and traumatic relationships
with men and boys. In a reversal of the usual pattern in civilized socieitie,
the women have the income and the ties to government authority and support.
The men are economically and socially subordinate.... This balance of power
virtually prohibits marriage which is everywhere based on the provider role
of men counterbalancing the sexual and domestic superiority of women.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I almost don't want to mention the source of this arresting notion - conservative
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> writing in the conservative American
Spectator (June 1995) - for fear that the name and affiliation might lead
some readers to suspend thought. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You see, of course, where Gilder is headed: Men, he believes, are the key
to strong families. And they are, the more successful welfare is - even
if it leads women to jobs, child care and improved earnings - the worse
it will be for families, because it will &quot;render the men still more
optional, desperate, feral, and single.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does any of this make sense? How would I feel, hearing this indispensable-man
argument, if I were female - especially if I were a single mother? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Already there has been a stream of books and articles (several of the latter
by me) arguing the negative effects of absent fathers on children and on
communities, or contending that the breakdown of marriage is the leading
indicator of social pathology, or otherwise calling for reclamation of men
and boys as the means of rescuing society. The Million Man March only underscored
the notion. Women must be wondering what makes us think men are God's primary
gift? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Gilder isn't quite saying we are. What he is saying is that children
need their fathers, too - and so do their mothers - and that welfare almost
calculatedly drives the men away, perpetuating both the worst effects of
welfare and the need for it. Listen: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire welfare state - from Donna Shalala to Bob Dole's Senate
offices - is relentlessly feminist, mandating preferences for women on construction
sites, in police cruisers, in Air Force jets and in athletic scholarships.
These programs necessarily concentrate their job incentives, training benefits,
and subsidies on women rather than on men because, in general, it is only
the mothers who are on welfare. The fathers use the apartments and take
the money of a series of welfare mothers, usually without joining the dole.
Thus the recipients of welfare-related work will mainly be women. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we know from reams of studies and centuries of experience that
only fathers can satisfactorily sustain families, reliably discipline teen-age
boys, and lift a community from poverty. The idea that welfare mothers can
do it while the government raises their children is incredibly naive....
The very idea that women with small children should work outside the home
is perverse. The welfare state has already deprived these children of fathers.
The workfare state proposes to take away the mothers as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Implicit in Gilder's analysis is his thesis of woman as civilizer of naturally
predatory man. How does she do it? By demanding commitment (which she needs)
in exchange for sex (his priority). Welfare eliminates the economic basis
for the commitment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unless they are tamed by marriage and the provider role,&quot; he
says, &quot;men become enemies of civilization and revert to their primordial
role as predators.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this blame-shifting drivel, as some surely will contend? Or has Gilder
found the virus that is killing our families and our communities? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He says it too harshly and too categorically, perhaps, but I think he is
on to something. The natural promiscuity of men combined with the increasing
unnecessity of men (except for sex) produces a breed frighteningly close
to Gilder's description of &quot;optional, desperate, feral and single.&quot;
We have to make men necessary again. <BR>

<P>In the oceanic sweep of the information age, the once separate streams
of computers and telecom are converging into new digital floods of innovation
that shift as inexorably as the tides of the sea. As we rush toward a millennial
crest of invention, a new tidal shift is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of this shift is not the computer industry, which has long
ruled supreme, but the telecom equipment industry. Because average citizens
have always preferred communicating to computing, the shift from computers
to networks will transform the fruits of progress - once chiefly accessible
from the lofty reaches of the elite - to an everyday harvest as popular
and ubiquitous as the phone.<BR>
<BR>
The latest cycles began in the years following the Second World War, when
the telecommunications industry spearheaded research that brought such key
advances as the transistor and the laser. Over the last forty years, the
computer industry has ridden the transistor to dominance in the information
economy. New laser-based breakthroughs in fiber optics, however, now promise
to turn the tide again toward telephony. While the computer will still be
king, the network will become the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The siege of computer progress has been sustained over the last twenty years
by Moore's Law, based on the famous prophecy by Intel founder Gordon Moore
in 1978 that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every
eighteen months. Implicit in Moore's Law is a similar doubling every eighteen
months in computer power: the number of millions of instructions per second
(MIPS) that a single microprocessor or personal computer could perform.<BR>
<BR>
But the epoch of Moore's Law dominance is now ending. The silicon microcosm
- the physical source of innovation in microchips and computers - is giving
way to the optical telecosm and its even more rapid pace of advance in communications
power.<BR>
<BR>
Signaling the transition from microcosm to telecosm is one key metric: the
performance of publicly available networks compared to the performance of
the internal computer buses that connect microprocessor central processing
units (CPUs) to memories, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors. Today, new
fiber optics and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems being launched
by leading telco suppliers are overthrowing the key foundations of computer
industry supremacy on the leading edges of innovation. Now in view, as early
as next year, is a bandwidth crossover point where the communications power
of widely available telephone networks will surpass for the first time the
communications power of the internal buses of personal computers.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, while telecom bandwidth apparently stagnated, North American
phone companies installed some ten million miles of optical fiber - in effect,
a new bandwidth infrastructure in North America. So far, less than one-millionth
of the potential communications power of this fiber has been delivered to
customers.<BR>
<BR>
Now this potential bandwidth is about to erupt as a kinetic force of change
in the information economy. Telephone companies plan to increase the maximum
bandwidth of corporate services from the current 2.4 gigabits per second
to 40 gigabits per second in 1997. They will quadruple capacity, and quadruple
it again within the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
The explosion of bandwidth, however, will not transform the information
economy until it is delivered to people's homes. Delivery of the new tides
of bandwidth requires that telcos commanding advanced fiber and switch capabilities
collaborate with cable companies possessing broadband lines to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term bandwidth expander is ATM. It radically simplifies
the switching problem by putting all information in uniform 53-byte cells
that can be processed entirely in silicon chips without time-consuming access
to memory and software. With guaranteed delivery of cells on a fixed schedule
soon to reach a pace of 2.4 gigabits a second, ATM can manage multimedia
voice, data, and video all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
These new technologies can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and a remote archive or digital library. PCs will be able to
tap databases and libraries across the world as readily as they can reach
their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of telecom equipment, this new architecture provides huge
opportunities to launch new ATM systems on every scale, new network hardware
and software, and new optical communications equipment. The companies that
truly grasp that the network is the computer, and invest in the infrastructure
of the new networked economy, will dominate the decade.<BR>
<BR>
However, amid these torrents of bandwidth abundance, the greatest rewards
will accrue to people around the globe, joining the ever-expanding circles
of prosperity in an age of information.<BR>
<BR>
Many skeptics suggest that the new technologies will chiefly favor the already
prosperous and powerful in the industrialized countries. But the first beneficiaries
of the new age are Asian nations, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia and
China. Trapped in Third World poverty as recently as two decades ago, they
are now supplying crucial components to major telecom and computer companies
and leading the world in rates of economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade, digital networks will provide a new central nervous
system for the world economy. Transformed by convergence and computerization,
TV will burst forth in a new flowering of choice and empowerment. An abundance
of multimedia choices can remedy and reverse the cultural debacle of mass
market television. Transcending the current programming of the lowest common
denominator, video culture will effloresce into a plethora of products as
rich and various as books and magazines.<BR>
<BR>
Great cities will give up their current role as hives of industry and emerge
as havens of social activity and entertainment. On the network, an inner-city
child in public housing can pursue a curriculum far richer in learning resources
and far better adapted to personal needs and aptitudes than the program
of an elite suburban school today. Equipped with ATM and fiber-optic links,
small towns will become creative centers in the information economy. Productive
citizens will retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets
and communities. Hollywood and Wall Street will become historic curiosities
as their businesses diffuse to all points of the continent and the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Perfectly targeted to the most acute problems of the era, the new technologies
can reverse the spirals of decay afflicting many institutions and communities.
Traffic and pollution, ignorance and waste, can all give way to worldwide
webs of glass and light. <BR>
<BR>
The home will re-emerge as an industrial center, with marriages gaining
new roles and meanings around the evolving silicon hearths of a new cottage
economy, thus strengthening family values.<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the costs and raising the effectiveness of medical care will be
the on-line house call, sharing scarce diagnostic tools, tapping remote
specialists, and bringing busy doctors back to the patients' bedsides in
targeted teleconferences.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all these changes, one theme will triumph: the empowerment of
individual families and customers against remote and irresponsible organizations.
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or at the mall or in the local corporate center. Instead, they
will seek out and command their first choices in jobs, culture, entertainment,
and religion.<BR>
<BR>
Ranging across continents to find the best colleagues for every major project,
workers will scale new pinnacles of productivity and wealth. A culture of
first choices will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward
the mediocre, the vulgar, or the vicious.<BR>
<BR>
The age of mass manufacturing, mass marketing, and mass media brought capital
and labor together in vast pyramidal corporations, tying workers to the
machine and the tube. The explosive centrifuge of the telecosm will burst
these chains of industrial concentration. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and machine-age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth abundance not only fuels the advance of electronics; it also galvanizes
the growth of economies. The new media extend the webs of news and interconnection
that nourish markets and expand opportunity. <BR>
<BR>
Lavishing the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly
productive tools, and unleasing creativity with increasingly fertile and
targeted capital, the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope
to the masses of people who the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than giving millions of viewers access to five hundred channels of
one-way TV, the new technology will give all users two-way teleconferencing
with colleagues regardless of where they are - reading documents and books,
sharing multimedia experiences, consulting with specialists on your rare
disease at the Mayo Clinic or Columbia, touring Venice and Vancouver the
same day, dallying simultaneously at the Louvre and the London Museum, designing
a new building with an architect in Israel or a new dress with a couturier
in Paris or a new chip with a guru in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Through these channels, the poorest citizens will gain access to new worlds
of education, employment, entertainment, medical care, and communication
now commanded only by elites - a true transfer of power to the people everywhere.<BR>

<PRE>
What will happen over the next several years is that the external 
bandwidth of most computers--that is, the bandwidth of the 
asynchronous transfer mode networks that are being developed by 
some 600 companies and that are being deployed at an increasing 
pace--will be bigger than the internal bandwidth. And that will mean 
that computers will be able to tap remote databases and educational 
possibilities as readily as they tap their internal disk drives and CD-
ROMs. This means that, in a sense, the computer will hollow out, and 
the network will become the computer in a way that has never been 
true before. 


And the effect of this is that the Law of the Microcosm will join the 
Law of the Telecosm. The Law of the Microcosm says that if you take 
any number n transistors and put them on a single sliver of silicon, 
you get n-squared performance and value (thats one of the key 
exponentials that drive this era). The Law of the Telecosm says that 
if you take any number n computers and put them on a network you 
get n-squared performance and value, because each computer uses 
the network as a resource and is also a potential resource for the 
network.
	

And so the value of the network exponentially increases as the 
number of computers connected to it increases. And I think its the 
convergence of these two laws, both of which are central to the 
evolution of the computer industry, that will really shape the future. 
Its not going to be Hollywood executives who are going to be the 
chief drivers of the new age; they in fact will be victims of the new 
age. The chief drivers and the real winners are the computer and 
computer networking industries, as they interconnect Americas 
schools and colleges and homes into a truly new World Wide Web of 
glass and light. That is the real promise of the next era, and its going 
to happen faster than people expect, not more slowly. 


Theres still an optical illusion at the communications cliff at LANs 
end, but that can be quickly overcome by the use of cable 
technology--the coaxial that is already in the ground and connecting 
American homes, and particularly connecting to all the homes with 
computers. Last year there were some 26 million PCs in American 
homes, and 24 million of those homes had cable connections, and 
these cable connections are fully adequate to open the way for this 
transformation of the computer--the hollowing out of the computer, 
the moving of the computer onto the network, and the 
transformation of computer network architecture over the next 
decade.
	

So I think its a sure thing that education will be a much bigger 
market than entertainment. This is almost a certainty. Because 
education fits with computer technology, which is the driving force of 
this industry. But its not just the computer technology thats 
important, its the culture of the computer industry. Its the power of 
the commitment of increasing millions of citizens to this technology 
as a key channel for their creation of wealth and their advancement 
of learning.
	

And so its not just a technological issue, its a cultural issue, and 
the computer as a learning tool is a generator of wealth that will 
absorb an increasing share of our energies and creativity in the 
information age and will continue to expand its domain; whereas 
television will always be a disappointment because its essentially a 
diversion. It doesnt edify, it doesnt add to the national endowment, it 
tends to subtract from it. Its not the idiot box that will lead the U.S. 
into a new information age.


I think that the past years well-publicized efforts at convergence 
were really misconceived. US West and Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
turning to Hollywood talent agent Mike Ovitz is really rather 
pathetic, because when you think about it, if youre Mike Ovitz and 
you make a movie you really want it to go on everybodys conduit, 
whereas if youre Bell Atlantic and you run a network you want 
everybodys movies on that network. In other words, theres no 
benefit anymore from combining content and conduit in an era of 
truly broadband network. The exponential thrust comes from 
combining conduit with conduit, and allowing the people on the 
network to supply their own content to a great extent, in an 
entrepreneurial process thats almost entirely unpredictable.
	

But I think you can tell the general shape of the multimedia 
market that will emerge. It wont resemble Hollywood and it wont 
resemble broadcast television: It will resemble the book industry. 
There are about 80,000 books published every year in the United 
States, and the stores that are gaining share are the stores that offer 
the most choice. The key to the book industry is when a customer 
goes into a book store the customer gets his or her first choice. You 
get the book you want rather than a book thats been scheduled for 
you.
  

I think that same idea also gives us the key to finding the real 
opportunity in education in the information age. Students will get 
their first choice rather than some choice thats defined for them by 
some remote hierarchy. The power is migrating to the customer and 
that will be the driving force of the economy in the next decade, and 
it will be an exciting time.</PRE>

<PRE>An information technology visionary who writes compellingly about the 
relationship between technology and economics, George Gilder is the 
author of Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology 
(1989), Wealth and Poverty (1981), and numerous other works. His 1990 
book Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and 
American Life is now being issued by W.W. Norton Co. in a revised 
paperback edition with five new chapters.

	Gilder has been a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard and is currently a senior fellow of the Discovery 
Institute in Seattle. He lectures widely across the Country and around 
the world and will be a featured speaker at the Educom'94 conference 
this fall in San Antonio. Educom Review caught up with him just as he 
was about to leave for Europe to present a speech at Cambridge 
University.

Educom Review: You've used &quot;A Convergence of Corpses&quot; as the title for 
the prologue to Life after Television, and you've said that mergers such 
as the one recently attempted by Bell Atlantic and TCI &quot;mostly miss the 
point of the digital age.&quot; Who are all these corpses, and how are all 
these mergers missing the point?

<B>GILDER</B>: The real driving force of all this information technology is the 
triumph of the computer. Just as the personal computer essentially 
displaced the mainframe over the past ten years, over the next ten years 
the personal computer will displace the television set, the telephone, 
and an array of other appliances. So companies that attempt to exploit 
the opportunities of convergence by converging with TV sets, for 
example, tend to fail, as 3DO seems already to have failed, precisely 
because of that mistake. Meanwhile, Creative Labs was based on a less 
exciting technology--a soundboard for the PC--but has become an enormous 
company riding the tremendous ascendancy of 
personal computing.

<B>ER</B>: So your advice to 3DO would have been . . . ?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, my advice at the time was that they had better get 
connected to computers and regard computers as the interactive 
appliance. If they focused on the TV set, they would lose. And that's 
what seems to have been happening.
Other errors are being made by companies that target the set-top box and 
devote an enormous amount of design effort to squeezing computing power 
into the price point and form factor of a consumer electronics set-top 
box. 

<B>ER</B>: Why did 3DO ignore your advice?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I guess they were just infatuated with television. They'd 
come from founding MTV, and they imagined TV as an instrument with a 
future that somehow commands larger markets than the personal computer. 

But personal computers in homes are increasing ten times faster than 
television sets, and PC owners spend fifteen hundred bucks for the 
device itself and then another fifteen hundred bucks on software and 
peripherals, and within that price point you can accomplish anything 
that a set-top box or game machine can accomplish. And if you have 
broadband connections, for example, over cable lines through a cable 
modem, the PC can do anything the TV can do and do it just as well. 

That's the key limitation today: bandwidth. As Andy Grove says, infinite 
processing power will get you only so far with limited bandwidth. The 
key to the next generation of computer development is coupling the 
personal computer with broadband networks. 

Today, the personal computer is crippled by its need to devote most of 
its MIPs [million instructions per second], or a large portion of them, 
to compressing and decompressing any images that it uses. Thus 
teleconferencing, for example, and video telephones are so drastically 
unsatisfactory because all the computer MIPs are devoted to compressing 
and decompressing rather than to real computer functions. 

Once the PC is connected to broadband networks, it will really ascend to 
its dominant level in homes as well as offices. And that will be the 
crucial opportunity for educational materials as well.

<B>ER</B>: You say in Life after Television that &quot;TV ignores the reality that 
people are not inherently couch potatoes; given a chance they talk back 
and interact.&quot; Then how do you explain some of the disappointments of 
interactivity, such as GTE's Cerritos project, or the US West/TCI 
project in Denver, neither of which seemed to gain much loyalty from its 
subscribers?

<B>GILDER</B>: The explanation is that they all use the TV, and the TV is 
inherently a couch potato device, which is particularly lame at 
presenting text. Yet text is a crucial part of multimedia communications 
and interactivity. Those projects made the same error that 3DO made: 
they converged with a corpse. Unless you're a necrophiliac, that's not 
particularly gratifying.

<B>ER</B>: Alan Kay used the phrase &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; to express the concern 
that the new media would be mass communications oriented and that 
literacy would fall apart.

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, any instrument that creates &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; is going to 
fail, because it's going to make people poorer. Markets expand in the 
long run only if they are absolutely central industries in the economy--
if they're creating capital rather than depleting it. TV in general 
dissipates and deflates human capital, and game machines are 
distractions that fail to edify their users. 

The people who use PCs generate wealth with them rather than merely 
distract themselves, so they're willing to invest a lot more effort into 
their PCs. They're willing to master the intricacies of use, and they're 
also willing to contribute to the development of further applications. 
In contrast, all these consumer electronics devices are mostly self-
limiting, because they don't contribute to wealth creation, but instead 
actually distract people from their career and their higher pursuits.

<B>ER</B>: By emphasizing the extent to which people are different, don't you 
run the risk of ignoring how much they are actually the same, that is, 
of ignoring what we might uncharitably call the herd instinct that 
dictates a lot of fashion, a lot of politics, and a lot of life?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think that people are the same in relatively lower-level 
ways, so if you have a medium that appeals chiefly to the way people are 
the same, they're going to gravitate increasingly to prurient interests, 
morbid fears and anxieties, and shocks and sensations. If you do that, 
the whole culture will become depraved--and I think that's what happened 
with the TV--whereas I think that if you appeal to people's special 
curiosities and hobbies and career interests and other ambitions--if you 
appeal to people's first choices rather than their lowest-common-
denominator choices--then the culture gravitates toward excellence 
rather than toward mediocrity, toward distinction rather than prurient 
interest and titillation.

<B>ER</B>: So what becomes of the herd instinct? Does it go away?
GILDER: There will always be certain things that people still want to do 
in large numbers, but in general it's people as individuals or as 
members of homes and families that can cement to more edifying 
disciplines. A mob can just say yes or no, whereas an individual can 
articulate, can express subtle and complex ideas, can respond to art, 
can aspire toward God. 

Rather than encouraging the mass tendencies of the population, we should 
be trying to counteract them and to educate the population. Education is 
a fulfillment of individual distinction and excellence; it shouldn't be 
a pandering to mass taste and appetites. And to the extent that schools 
do try to cater to their students rather than to teach them, the schools 
will fail and will contribute to the general deterioration of learning.

<B>ER</B>: If we think of life before television as the age of the amateur 
(with social life focused on the family piano, on amateur theater 
groups, on sandlot baseball games), and life during television as the 
age of the professional (with social life organized around boob tube 
performances by millionaire actors, comedians, athletes, and 
politicians), how should we think about the quality of life after 
television? Will it help us back to the idyllic past of the amateur? Or 
will it be better than our past as well our present?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think it will be better. I think the culture will take a form 
more resembling the book culture than the TV culture. There are 55,000 
books published in the United States every year. There's a religious 
book market as big as the trade book market, and each of those markets 
amount to about $2.5 billion. There are a huge number of successful 
technical books and career books, and there's a wide diversity of 
literature. I think the book market is a much better reflection of 
American culture than the TV market, which I think is a perversion of 
American culture. 

In general, the interactive media culture will resemble book culture and 
literary culture more than it will the current mass culture. You know, 
the people who produce mass culture are the ultimate elitists. I've 
often debated with them, and they'll say to me, &quot;You don't understand, 
George, the reason that the boob tube is an idiot box is that people 
really are boobs. We've done market research. We know they're boobs.&quot;

 Well, I think they just don't understand the business. Of course, 
confronted with the boob tube, we're all boobs; when I get into a hotel 
room at night and start clicking through channels, I get distracted by 
the shocks and sensations just as anyone else would. The critical fact 
is that a mass medium is no good whatsoever at conveying educated ideas; 
if it happens to convey a sophisticated idea, that's just an accident. 

I think the French were perfectly right in trying to exclude U.S. 
television programs, because for the most part such programs are the 
ultimate realization of mass taste, and they are depraved and 
destructive. They are deeply destructive to American society, 
particularly to any effort to educate anyone in it. And yet the schools 
increasingly try to simulate the TV culture, which is their worst 
betrayal!

<B>ER</B>: Simulate TV culture in what way?

<B>GILDER</B>: By having students read dumb books that seem to be simulations 
of TV sensibility. By avoiding anything difficult. By trying to pander 
to the kids, to entertain them rather than teach them.

<B>ER</B>: Compare two serious approaches to television: PBS and C-SPAN. Some 
people have said that C-SPAN is what public television ought to be. What 
do you think?

<B>GILDER</B>: C-SPAN now exists without the aid of public TV, and PBS works at 
all only because of the garbage that's on all the other channels. Just 
by being explicitly elitist, PBS can shine luminously in the darkness. 
But beyond that, I just don't really believe any of these channels or 
networks have a future. And, particularly, I don't think TV news has any 
future at all. So I believe that although within the existing regime of 
thirty channels or whatever, C-SPAN and PBS are better than the others, 
it's all still a vast wasteland. A channel like C-SPAN will still have a 
place in a world where you have one channel and it's yours, but 
enterprises like PBS and CNN are resources only for a world in which 
there are few channels and no control over them.

<B>ER</B>: Why is there no future for TV news?

<B>GILDER</B>: Because TV news is all governed by the two-minute rule, which 
says that you can't devote more than two minutes to a story unless it's 
a war or something. But the reason for that is not that people have any 
particular desire for two-minute stories; to the contrary, people want 
much more than two minutes on any story that actually interests them.
TV's two-minute rule exists because people will zap any story longer 
than two minutes that doesn't interest them. And so network news is 
guided entirely by that negative constraint, and within the two-minute 
limit, it necessarily has to go for sensational images and crashes and 
fires and murders and whatever. 

News is getting worse and worse that way, and the only reason TV news 
now succeeds is its timeliness and its ability to present video, but 
newspapers will shortly be able to present video and pictures and 
everything else in just as timely a way as television does; moreover, 
the newspaper of the future will be able to give you access to archives 
and to advertisements that actually step you through to the transaction 
itself, a process that requires text.

<B>ER</B>: You've pointed out in Life after Television that some 70 percent of 
the costs of a film go for distribution and advertising, saying, &quot;In 
every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key impact of the 
computer-networking revolution is to collapse the costs of distribution 
and remove the middlemen.&quot; What's the future of the middlemen in 
educational systems? Do you agree with Lew Perelman's thesis in School's 
Out that hyperlearning will replace, rather than merely reform, 
conventional education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Yeah, I agree mostly with Lew. I don't think that things change 
so abruptly as he implies they will, but it's clear that because schools 
are centralized and dominated by these educationist elites, they're 
ineffective in teaching children. And so I think in the same way as the 
computer has tended to break down all existing hierarchies, monopolies, 
pyramids, and power grids of established industrial society, it will 
break down centralized educational institutions as well. There is no 
correlation--period--between spending per student and performance per 
student, adjusted for education and income of parents. But there is a 
very statistically significant negative correlation between the amount 
of bureaucracy per student and the performance of the student. 

So it's clear that the middlemen in education are not merely dead wood, 
they are also a  destructive force, and they actually prevent education. 
It's teachers that are needed, and teachers don't need much supervision. 

The computer essentially replaces vertically organized institutions with 
horizontally organized institutions. It distributes intelligence and 
power rather than concentrates them; it endows teachers with authority 
and responsibility rather than reducing teachers to being instruments of 
some educational bureaucracy. And the reason teachers don't care about 
anything but money as far as their organizations are concerned is that 
the bureaucrats have destroyed the experience of teaching and the 
gratification of teaching. This is why the schools are such perverse 
institutions. As Lew Perelman says, academia is a socialist bureaucracy 
as big as the Soviet government at its height, and it is going to fail 
just about as cataclysmically.

<B>ER</B>: Do your observations apply from top to bottom? Do they also apply to 
higher education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there's greater diversity in higher education--
quite a lot of diversity--and that the schools people think are good are 
mostly bad, and some of the schools people think are bad are in fact 
quite good. For example, I think about 70 percent of the courses at 
Harvard are useless. You know less when you finish than when you 
started. All those endless sociology courses and social science courses 
and social psychology and political science courses, and the endless 
efforts to retrieve some inkling of truth from Marxism!  
You know, it's as though they were still teaching some pre-Copernican 
astronomy--they're really obscurantists in those institutions. It 
reflects the collapse of the elite culture in the United States, but I 
think there are a lot of other cultures out there, and a lot of schools 
that people don't pay attention to are in fact a lot better. Schools 
like Hillsdale, schools like Thomas Aquinas.

There are also schools like CalTech and Harvey Mudd--schools that are 
excellent in science and technology. These are the best schools in the 
country, because the one thing this culture does well is science and 
technology. One of the real jokes is when you find MIT increasingly 
trying to teach students the humanities. I think the humanities as 
taught in existing universities are mostly perverse: Nihilist, 
relativist, feminist, and Marxist. Marxism is just a completely 
worthless mode of study, and yet it's pursued intently at a great many 
elite universities as though there's something still in it.

<B>ER</B>: What would you recommend to a 17-year-old?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there are two possibilities. One is, if such 17-
year-old boys or girls really have their act together, have strong 
convictions, and know what they want to study, then it would be 
interesting to attend one of the elite universities and be kind of a 
counterforce there and create an adversarial culture. Publications like 
the Dartmouth Review, the Salient at Harvard, and the Prospect at 
Princeton are part of a whole series of conservative publications across 
the country that are kinds of centers of resistance and rebellion on 
these corrupt campuses, and that's probably a pretty good education, to 
pursue that course. In general, however, I'd recommend getting a 
technical or scientific education, because I don't think the schools are 
teaching anything else.

<B>ER</B>: Granting that technological advances will have a great impact on the 
general culture, don't you fear that money will have an even greater 
impact? Are cities with thirty trashy radio stations better served than 
towns with only two, and are they not the victims of investors who are 
chasing maximum ad revenues? Have the 55,000 trade books published last 
year in the United States produced a better general culture? Or has the 
culture been affected mainly by the small number of books--and movies 
and television shows--that were hyped into best-seller-dom?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think that America is still the world's leading economy and it 
produces a tremendous amount of art and literature that elude the elite 
media and elite institutions and elite critical vessels. If American 
culture were really summed up by TV culture, there would be no leading 
software company, no world-leading 
scientific/educational enterprise, no globally ascendant computing 
industry. Bioengineering wouldn't be centered in the United States, and 
so forth.

So I really don't think this elite mass culture--and I believe it is 
elitist, contrived by elites to pander to mass prurience and anxiety--
can generate anything worthwhile, and I don't think it does. The actual 
success of the United States does not stem from what the media generally 
treat--in other words, phenomena like the personal computer that are 
incomparably more important than phenomena like Madonna.

<B>ER</B>:  What is the hardest part of your ideas for people to comprehend? 
I'm sure that many of the people in charge of the converging corpses of 
Hollywood, TV, cable, and publishing have read your books or heard you 
speak. Why do you think they can't get the message?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think a lot of them do get the message, and the ones who 
do are actually doing well. The ones who are pursuing the PC incurred 
nothing but upside surprises last year. At the beginning of the year it 
was predicted by Bill Gates and Andy Grove--the world's leading experts 
on the subject--that between 34 and 37 million personal computers would 
be sold in 1993; the actual number turned out to be almost 50 million 
computers--about 30 or 40 percent more than expected. 

And all the people who produce software and peripherals for personal 
computers and personal computer networks prospered. The computer 
industry grew 20 percent or so last year, while consumer electronics was 
stagnant. A lot of people developed CD-ROMs, which were a $5-billion 
business last year, up from virtually nothing a few years ago. 

The cable industry, which I consulted with a lot and which I think I 
influenced a lot, recently launched a wide array of products to connect 
computers over the cable network, and those products are going to be 
very important and valuable. I predict that during the next five years 
or so the computer industry will yield more products for cable companies 
than the TV industry does.

<B>ER</B>: What advice would you give to the president of a college or 
university?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think a kind of organizing principle, such as St. John's Great 
Books Program or St. Thomas Aquinas's orientation toward the Catholic 
worldview, can animate an educational experience, whereas trying to be a 
smorgasbord of secular social theory is going to result in both a bad 
experience for students and failure as an educational institution. 
You've got to be willing to teach some specific thing. You can't adopt 
some relativist posture, because that will mean that fanatics will 
dominate the institution, and most of these institutions are dominated 
by propagandists rather than by teachers.

<B>ER</B>: And what would you advise college and university presidents to do 
with regard to information technology?

<B>GILDER</B>: They should digitize their libraries and make them available 
from student rooms over computer networks. They should in general not 
restrict the resources of the college to the classrooms in it, but reach 
out from their own classrooms to students around the world who want to 
take courses with the excellent teachers available, while at the same 
time allowing the students on campus to reach out around the world. In 
other words, make your educational institution one that summons the best 
from universities everywhere, rather than focusing on the faculty and 
students that happen to be assembled at your particular location.</PRE>

<H1><CENTER>The Dark Fiber Interview with George Gilder </CENTER>
</H1>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Gilder mixes high technology and social politics.
His best-selling book, <I>Wealth and Poverty</I>, practically outlined our
loving embrace of high- tech entrepreneurs in the 1980s. Research for that
book led him deeper into the physics of silicon microchips. He emerged with
<I>Microcosm</I>, a book about how silicon-chip technology causes matter
to &quot;collapse&quot; into a microcosm where the usual economies of scale
are reversed: Small is better. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of decentralized telecommunications prompted his monograph <I>Life
After Television</I>, which is in some ways a warm-up for the book he is
working on now - <I>Telecosm</I> - a study of how the telecomputer will
enhance individual liberty. In this interview with Wired's Executive Editor
Kevin Kelley, Gilder expounds on society's current great work: wiring the
planet. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>KK</B>: Your book, Microcosm, begins with a quote from physicist Carver
Mead, who said, &quot;Listen to technology; find out what it's telling you.&quot;
I was wondering, what is the current technology of modems, packet-switching,
and fiber optics telling you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
GG</B>: It's telling me that today we're at the same general point that
we were with integrated circuits in about 1970. In 1970, people didn't anticipate
that transistors would be virtually free by today. Today you can buy a transistor
for 4,000-millionths of a cent. I think the same thing is on its way in
fiber optics. We're going to gain access to the 25,000 gigahertz of capacity
that's in each of the three windows in infrared spectrum that work with
fiber optics. With 25,000 gigahertz, you get the equivalent to the number
of phone calls in America during the peak moment on Mother's Day. Or take
all the radio spectrum currently used for communications, from AM radio
to KU-band satellite. It's 1,000 times that, on one thread of glass the
width of a human hair. I don't think people have come to terms with what
fiber really means. You can simulate any kind of switching configuration
you want. All of a sudden this huge apparatus of electronic switching that
dominates our current communications becomes unnecessary. Suddenly, you're
going to find that just as the integrated circuit rendered transistors -
and hence mips and bits - virtually free, fiber optics is going to render
bandwidth and hertz virtually free. This world is quite different from the
world that assumes bandwidth scarcity. A dearth of spectrum has to be regulated
and parceled out carefully by sensitive federal bureaucrats beset by tens
of thousands of lawyers. That whole apparatus, both the technology of it
- the huge switching fabric of the phone companies - and the legislative
apparatus and all its bureaucracies and legal accessories, are going to
be rendered almost worthless over the next ten years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Every time I hear the phrase &quot;virtually free&quot; I think
of the claim about nuclear power: &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot; It's almost
utopian. I find myself not believing it, as much as I want to go along with
the idea. Am I too skeptical? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yep. It's just that when things become free you ignore them.
Transistors that used to be seven bucks apiece now cost about a millionth
of a cent. That means that you can regard them as insignificant, just as
they're becoming ubiquitous and thus determining the whole atmosphere of
enterprise. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, you could say that aluminum - by the atom - has become
virtually free, but that doesn't mean aluminum in any useful amount is free.
As long as we have storage devices, we'll find things to fill them up with,
so there will always be a demand for more. That means no matter how cheap
storage becomes, it won't be free. It seems to me that the appetite for
bandwidth is equally insatiable, so people will always want more than they
have. It has to cost something. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Of course it will. The point is that in every industrial revolution,
some key factor of production is drastically reduced in cost. Relative to
the pervious cost to achieve that function, the new factor is virtually
free compared to its expense when it derived from animal muscle power and
human muscle power. Suddenly you could do things you could not afford to
do before. You could make a factory work 24 hours a day churning out products
in a way that was just incomprehensible before the industrial era. It really
did mean that physical force became virtually free in a sense. The whole
economy had to reorganize itself to exploit this physical force. You had
to &quot;waste&quot; the power of the steam engine and its derivatives in
order to prevail, whether in war or in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last 30 years, we've seen transistors (or switching power) move
from being expensive, crafted vacuum tubes to being virtually free. So today,
the prime rule of thrift in business is &quot;waste transistors.&quot; We
&quot;waste&quot; them to correct our spelling to play solitaire, to do
anything. As a matter of fact, you've got to waste transistors in order
to succeed in business these days. My thesis is that bandwidth is going
to be virtually free in the next era in the same way that transistors are
in this era. It doesn't mean there won't be expensive technologies associated
with the exploitation of bandwidth - just as there are expensive computers
employing transistors; but it does mean that people will have to use this
bandwidth, they'll have to waste bandwidth rather than economize on bandwidth.
The wasters of bandwidth will win rather than the people who are developing
exquisite new compression tools and all these other devices designed to
exploit some limited bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
One of the key ways you economize on bandwidth is switching. Switching has
been the whole foundation of our communications systems. You run narrow-band
wires to some switch and then switch the data to its destination in order
to avoid using lots of bandwidth to broadcast signals to every terminal.
It seems to me that we're going to start using fiber the way we currently
address air. Instead of switching, we'll broadcast on fiber optic. We'll
be tuning in rather than processing all the bits. And instead of using a
lot of switching intelligence in order to economize on bandwidth, we're
going to use bandwidth in order to economize on intelligence. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Okay. In a world where physical force, switching, and computation
are almost free, we now add almost-free bandwidth. What becomes expensive?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The scarce resource is the human mind. People will be more valuable.
People will get paid better. We need people to provide the software, the
interfaces, the standards, and the protocols to all these systems that make
it possible to exploit these increasingly cheap resources. So it's the human
mind that you ultimately have to economize on. That's the reason I think
it's utter garbage to say that our grandchildren won't live as well as we
do. People who say this just don't see the technology. They live in this
bizarre world of thermodynamics, where entropy rules, and we're dominated
by our waste products. it is very short-sighted. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: It take it then that as a believer in the human mind as sort
of the ultimate repository of wealth and power, that you're not a believer
in artificial intelligence as an attainable thing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Artificial intelligence is obviously attainable, it just won't
be human intelligence. It's a different function. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Do you think there's a downside to having everything connected
to everything else? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I don't see any. There must be a downside to the telephone, but
I can't remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, when you're in the middle of supper and some solicitor
is calling you, you'll probably remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, that's the downside. But that's the downside all this stuff
overcomes. When you can have intelligence in you telephone it can defer
the calls you don't want to voice mail and still take emergency calls. It
can be adapted to your needs. So, the chief effect of these technologies
is to put you in command again. The trouble with top-down centralized technologies,
which the telephone and television represent, is that they're dumb equipment
attached to complex switching systems and broadcasting technologies. On
the other hand, the chief virtue of distributed intelligence is that the
network can be dumb and the control of it can be distributed to smart users.
That means that technologies are much more servants than rulers of your
life. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: When I look at networks I see counter-intuitive behavior. Distributed
networks have a remarkable ability to be slightly out of anyone's control.
They possess an organic out-of-control quality. Does that concern you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I think it's good. The Internet, for instance, is an exciting
kind of metaphor for spontaneous order. It shows that in order to have a
very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control.
When there's a lot of intelligence at the fringes everywhere, the actual
network itself can be fairly simple. The future is dumb networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Dumb networks? Why not smart networks? We put smartness into
everything else. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There's smartness all around the network, but the actual network
should be essentially dumb glass. The fiberspace, as I call it. I think
the mistake that the phone companies sometimes make is to think that they
can keep up with the computer. What they call &quot;network intelligence&quot;
will usually appear as a bottleneck to a computer industry that's rapidly
rushing forward into new possibilities. So what you really want is dumb
networks where all intelligence is on the fringes. You'll have intelligent
devices of various sorts that are easily reachable from the network but
aren't part of the actual fabric of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What is the fabric of the network? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Photons. Electronics are not good for communications. Photons
- optical computing - are. What makes photons so great for communication
is they don't interfere with each other. They collide and pass on unaffected.
You can send them two-way, and they are not subject to electromagnetic disruption.
Many signals can flow through one fiber. But the fact that photons don't
affect each other means they are cumbersome for computing, since you want
interactions in computing. You need to have the charges affect one another
- that's the heart of computing. The heart of the transistor function is
that you can control a bigger force with a smaller force. But photons don't
control each other. So for computing functions I still think that electronics
will prevail; but for communications, photonics will prevail. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: One would think that there is wealth to be made in the interface
then between photons and electrons. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, there is. Opto-electronics is very important. However,
opto- electronics should not be in the middle of the network, it should
be one the edges of the network where it links the computing functions to
the communications functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There are some advocates who claim that we can get a lot of what
we want in fiber optic by using the existing copper wires beefed up with
the ISDN communication protocol. Do you go along with the idea of implementing
(and paying for ) ISDN right now? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yes. The phone companies should do ISDN. We might as well get
as much out of the existing copper switch system as we can. ISDN is already
installed in all the new switches; it's more a matter of getting the tariffs
right so they can charge some reasonable amount for it is use. There's no
excuse not to do ISDN today. It won't detract from the fibersphere. But
while they do ISDN, all-optical networks are going to be launched all over
the place by different companies. Some people have this vision that either
we devote our resources to ISDN, or we devote them to creating this fabulously
expensive fiber network. My belief is that fiber network is going to get
rapidly cheaper, so that we're going to be able to do both it and ISDN perfectly
well. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What role do you think the US government should play in laying
data highways? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The role for the US government is to make government as efficient
as possible. Government operates leviathan laboratories, hospitals, universities,
bureaucracies, and post offices, and they all should be interconnected with
fiber. The government always discovers technology after its moment is passing.
If you're a winner, you don't go to the government. You're too busy. You've
got too many customers. It's the people with no customers who end up besieging
the government. There are all these wise-asses in Washington who really
think that they can choose technologies. They think they know better. They
get bowled over by every earnest representative of IBM who comes up to talk
to them. <BR>
<BR>
Just now the US government thinks that HDTV is absolutely the future of
the world because all the old farts at Zenith, and the broadcasting moguls
who aren't really making it with the new computer technologies, are converging
on Washington. it's always going to be that way. It's not going to change
with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out
like poodles. The politician is always the dogs best friend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There is a myth, a utopian hope, that all these electronic connections
(what I call the &quot;advent of the net&quot;) are going to eliminate hierarchy.
The belief is that we will come into a peer world, where everything is on
a peer-to- peer level. All the experimental work that I have seen shows
that that's probably not very likely. On the contrary, anything complex
self-organizes into nested hierarchies, just in order to manage itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Right. The complexity of digital systems requires a hierarchical
organization. It's the only way to deal with the kind of combinatorial explosions
that attend interlinking of billions of nodes, all functioning in parallel.
You need nested hierarchies, but the real miracle of micro- electronics
is that these extraordinarily complex hierarchies can be incorporated into
individual silicon chips, with virtual supercomputer power capabilities.
This fabulous supercomputer power can be ubiquitously distributed, which
renders them an egalitarian force. <BR>
<BR>
When everybody commands a supercomputer, you give the average owner of a
work station the power that an industrial tycoon commanded in the industrial
era, or that a TV station owner commands in the age of broadcasting. In
other words, the hierarchy is in the silicon rather than in the human organization.
So you have this incredible distribution of power. This is a period of transition
that resembles the transition between railroads and automobiles. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: How's that? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: When you ride a train you go to the railway station at a scheduled
time, you travel with the people that happen to be on the train, you go
to preset destinations. This is what the current television world is like.
You tune into the stations that have been prescribed through some collaboration
between advertisers and TV executives in New York and Hollywood. Moving
from broadcast model to the teleputer is like moving from a railroad model
to automobiles. Automobiles are essentially egalitarian transportation systems.
They aren't organized - like the Internet. A Ferrari, say, and a Toyota
Tercel look like radically different machines, but the fact is that any
car endows the average person with more freedom than any railroad. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: You are a tireless champion of small business. For the last 20
years or so, really big projects have been considered arrogant, incapable
of working because they are big. Now there is talk of Motorola's global
satellite project Iridium. Do you think that the fibersphere gives us permission
to think big again. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There are going to be a lot of big fiber projects in the next
decade. They're already coming right now. I'm sort of worried that they're
going to think too small. I hope that the government, with its National
Research and Education Network (NREN) doesn't end up buying a lot of obsolescent
telephone company fiber systems that make networks with a total power of
a gigabit rather than a gigabit per terminal. The fibersphere is a big project,
and it will take scores of thousands of small companies to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What about big companies? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Sure. Laboratories where lots of people work on their own special
visions, with the luxury of very long-term goals, are very valuable. Such
places are usually supported by relatively big companies and consortia of
companies. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Bell Labs developed most of the component
for all optical networks. When you're producing millions of something it
becomes a commodity, and almost by definition you have a big company. MS-DOS
and Windows are commodity products, so Microsoft is a big company. <BR>
<BR>
There are cycles in which companies get big exploiting commodity products
with wide distribution, which then mature and then are displaced by new
products. It's relatively rare that the company that's triumphant in the
commodity phase. Insurrections are ordinarily led by entrepreneurs. I don't
see any likelihood that will change anytime soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What else is the technology telling you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: What the technology tells me is that, among other things, Clinton's
going to get a bonanza. He doesn't know what's coming, but technology's
just going to be breaking out all over. Bush did virtually everything that
Clinton promises to do, and because Bush has done it already it doesn't
leave Clinton much room except to play cock-a-doodle-do. He'll get up on
the post and crow as the marvelous sunrise technologies come blindingly
to the fore during his administration. They're going to have 50,000 technology
programs and behold, a million technologies will bloom and they will take
credit for it all. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Princess and the Barbarian</CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>By George Gilder<BR>

</CENTER>
</H2>
Once upon a time in a distant mountainous land there was a young and beautiful
princess who loved to wander in the woods. The forest was deep below the
snowcapped peaks and the valleys were quiet and safe. She could go freely
without care or fear. She could saunter along the trails that took local
merchants and messengers toward the passes to neighboring lands and brought
them back laden with news and commerce. She could watch for birds radiant
among the leaves and sometimes glimpse a deer dancing through the brush.
In summer she could swim in the brooks that hurtled down the mountains and
gathered in pools in the crevices. She was carefree and gay, at ease with
nature and the world.<BR>
<BR>
Then one year trouble struck this halcyon land. A barbarian moved into a
cave somewhere in the woods and began to prey on the merchants and messengers
making their way through the mountain passes. Although groups of young men
formed posses to pursue him, he was so strong and swift and so resourceful
in the ways of the woods and canyons that no one could catch him. Commerce
slowed and the kingdom grew steadily poorer. Merchants could travel only
in large groups protected by warriors. The king and queen bade the princess
to halt her wanderings and stay in the castle night and day. Someday, they
said, she would be queen, but until then she would have to learn the ways
of the palace. She pined for her dark and secret places among the trees,
but she did not disobey.<BR>
<BR>
One night, however, her sleep was beset with dreams of serpents. She woke
in fear as shadowy shapes lurched on her walls and sinister sounds whirred
outside her window. She went to the sill, parted the curtains, and gasped
at the wild beauty beyond. Through the trees, waving their arms in the night
winds and glistening in the moonlight, she could see deep into the forest
that she longed to explore. She yearned to run along the sylvan paths and
feel the pine needles under her bare feet and the breezes against her face
and in her hair. She longed to spy on the creatures of the night. Surely,
no one would notice or care if she should steal down the stone stairs and
step out on the moonlit path.<BR>
<BR>
As it happened, that same evening the barbarian, also restless in the night
season, set forth into the lunar darkness down the path that led toward
the castle. He walked quietly, like a cat slinking through the woods, until,
startled by the sound of steps, he slid behind a huge oak. At first he thought
he had heard some animal and raised his club. Then he sensed a human rhythm
in the paces and steeled himself for a robbery. When the princess finally
came into view, he gasped at the sight of her- -a beautiful girl garbed
only in a silken gown--gliding barefoot along the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Never before had a vision moved him so powerfully. The luminous night and
the woman alone, the shape and the shadows, reached in beyond his bearded
face and bristling chest and touched his sinuous heart. He stepped forward
and asked her if he might walk with her a while. She screamed and fled.
He pursued her, caught her, and pulled her to the ground, ripping her gown.
Then he seized her flailing arms and shook her to silence.<BR>
<BR>
Soon, however, he sensed that he wanted less to overpower than to please
her. Entranced by the wonders of her strong young body, he pleaded with
her to stop struggling--he meant her no harm. She told him to go ahead and
kill her if he wanted her, but to do it quickly and mercifully. He insisted
he had no desire to have her dead. He wanted her alive; he wished to hold
her body against his in the night. She said she would die first.<BR>
<BR>
He then changed his approach and asked her again if she would walk with
him for a while in the woods. She consented; it was a way to gain release
from his grasp. But as they strolled along, his gruff voice softened. With
quiet authority he described his life in the woods among the fierce animals
that threatened his survival and that he sometimes had to kill to escape.
She listened and marveled as he told her fantastic tales of the barbarian
life. She had never before heard of the struggle for life in the wilds beyond
the castle walls. They walked together until the glow of dawn shocked her
to her senses and she said she had to run back to the castle. The great
barbarian slumped in helpless anguish. She assured him she would be back
the next week to learn more. But to the barbarian, a week seemed an eternity.<BR>
<BR>
The next week she once more sneaked away from her bed after midnight and
walked in the woods with the barbarian. When the sun rose he lunged for
her, and she delicately slipped aside, saying she would be back again in
another seven days. The next week they once again walked and talked for
hours in the night. Finally he asked her to come back to see the etchings
on the walls of his cave.<BR>
<BR>
She said no, she would never go back to his lair until he halted his attacks
upon the merchants and messengers of the realm. He said robbery was his
way of life; all men robbed in one way or another; the king's entire territory
had been stolen from the barbarian's forebears, the natives of the land.
She told him severely that he had better find another way of living if he
expected her ever to visit him in his cave. He should make a clearing, build
a cabin, and grow a garden in the woods. He could collect nuts and berries
and hunt small game. With all his knowledge of the wilderness he could live
well, and she would come weekly to hear his tales of the night wood.<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian was heartbroken. The idea of a different life frightened and
repelled him. He was a nomadic predator, born to run in the forest and prey
on the weak. But finally he saw that he had no choice. To avoid losing the
princess, he recognized at last that he would have to give up the barbarian
life and get to work. And so he did. By the time he met her seven days hence,
he had cleared a large space among the trees. Within six months he had planted
a garden and built a cabin.<BR>
<BR>
During that time no robberies were reported on the road. Commerce with neighboring
kingdoms expanded rapidly as travel grew safer and merchants could go through
the mountain passes without an expensive guard of young warriors. With the
country growing richer, the barbarian did well selling wood and nuts to
the people. At last one day, after showing her his trove of produce, his
cabin enlarged with an octagonal wing, and his large gardens and herds of
goats, he asked the princess to marry him. Joyfully she said yes and brought
him back to the castle to meet her father and mother, the king and queen.<BR>
<BR>
At first the king declared that the barbarian's background made him entirely
unsuitable to be the mate of his precious daughter. But the queen replied
with a smile that he too had been something of a barbarian in his day and
he had to confess that this was true. The barbarian was certainly a refreshing
change from the unctuous courtiers who had previously pursued the princess.
The king and queen soon welcomed the youth as a strong and resourceful husband
for their daughter and an asset to the realm.<BR>
<BR>
The wedding brought a huge celebration throughout the kingdom. After a nostalgic
honeymoon in the cabin in the woods, the couple moved into the castle. Freed
from the ravages of the barbarian, the land continued to prosper. After
the princess's parents died, the barbarian himself became king and expanded
his domains deep into the mountains and the forest. In the course of time
the new queen bore a daughter and the daughter too grew into a beautiful
young princess, who, like her mother, hearkened to the call of the wild.<BR>
<BR>
As the realm grew ever richer, the king and queen invited famous wise men
from a neighboring kingdom to entertain at court. These men told of seductive
new ideas. They chilled the king and queen with tales of the death of God
and the eclipse of law, and excited them with accounts of the joys of libertine
sex. They brought books and art celebrating the new freedoms that followed
the breakdown of traditional morality and religion. They told of a city
called New York where everything indeed was new and free.<BR>
<BR>
The young princess listened avidly. Poring over the books, she learned of
the powers that princesses held in other nations. She learned to disdain
the stodgy, hardworking life of her parents' kingdom and to long for a land
where happiness was the only goal. As time passed these ideas gnawed at
her nocturnal thoughts. Like her mother she found her sleep disturbed by
serpentine dreams, and she would walk in the woods to quell the disquieting
desires that flooded her young body.<BR>
<BR>
Then a crisis struck the country. Another barbarian--as young and strong,
ruthless and resourceful as his predecessor--moved into the forest and began
preying on the commerce between the kingdom and the neighboring realm. Once
again the land became poor, and this princess too was forbidden to walk
in the woods. The princess, however, rebelled against her parents and continued
her excursions.<BR>
<BR>
One night she found herself suddenly confronted by the young barbarian.
She was even more beautiful than her mother, and the barbarian surged with
admiration and desire. He asked her if she minded if he walked with her
for a while. Deeply bored by her life in the castle, she agreed. They sauntered
along the path discussing the flaws of the king and the oppressive rules
within the walls. Shortly he put his arm around her shoulders and she pulled
away and said please, not yet. He asked her if she would return with him
to see the etchings in his cave. She suggested they first walk longer and
get to know one another better. But eventually they visited his cave together.
When she left at dawn, she promised to return the next week. &quot;Wow,&quot;
she exclaimed, &quot;you're good!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the next several months she visited with the barbarian every week and
they reveled in the cave. Then one day, a king arrived from the progressive
country of the wise men to visit with the father of the princess. This foreign
king was the most charming and cosmopolitan man the princess had ever seen.
He told her of the great riches and romantic forests of his land, of the
advanced universities and museums, of the flourishing commerce and art.
And after everyone went to bed, there was a knock on the door of the princess's
chamber.<BR>
<BR>
The princess opened the door and saw the foreign king outside, garbed in
a robe of purple velour. He asked to come in. He stayed until dawn, and
as the morning light suffused the room, along with the royal aroma of his
Paco Rabanne, he asked her to return with him to his kingdom. He would divorce
his queen and marry her. They had &quot;drifted apart,&quot; he said, and
his marriage &quot;was no longer a growthful experience.&quot; His wife
needed &quot;more space,&quot; and in his progressive views and liberated
lifestyle, he discovered he had far more in common with youth than with
his own generation. The princess agreed joyfully. Banishing the barbarian
in the woods from her thoughts, she returned the next day with the king
to her new land.<BR>
<BR>
Each week the barbarian waited in the forest for his princess. But she never
came. After a while he gave up waiting and angrily escalated his attacks
on the commerce between the two nations. As time passed, the mood of license
fostered by the wise men induced many young men to join the barbarian in
the woods. The nation fell into ruin and the forest became a jungle, ruled
by barbarians, where no princess ever dared to tread.

It rooted out bureaucracy, obliterated physical matter, and made the world

<H2>WHY WE NEED TO OVERHAUL<BR>
OUR ADVERSARIAL LEGAL SYSTEM
</H2>
<H4><I>By Roberta R. Katz<BR>
(Copyright 1996 by Roberta R. Katz)</I>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's a great honor for me to be standing up here today. I've spent several
years now thinking, and then writing, about legal reform, but this is the
<B>first </B>time I have publicly shared some of my thoughts with such a
large audience of businesspeople.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's a short preview of what I will spend the next 20 minutes talking
about. I intend to show you why legal reform issues are deadly serious for
this country, why the adversary system of justice is no longer a fully functional
system, and why you -- whoever you are -- need to get personally involved
in the resolution of these legal refon-n issues.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My own interest in this topic goes back to my law-firm days, when the anthropologist
in me began to sense some kind of shift taking place. It was not just that
clients had become so vocal about high legal costs. Or that lawyers were
now the butt of so many jokes and cartoons. Or even that many of my fellow
lawyers had become so aggressive and crude in how they practiced law. No,
what I was sensing was far more troubling to me. It was an awareness that
an increasing amount of the high-priced work we lawyers were doing was just
about process, and not about substance. In other words, the clients were
paying for more and more icing, and less and less cake.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken me several years to figure out the real cause of this problem.
The easy answer would have been to say that it's all the fault of greedy
lawyers. During the 1980s, when the money was rolling into the law fin-ns,
a relative few lawyers did get greedy. I'm sure you've read articles about
lawyers who prolonged cases, padded bills, exploited the system and otherwise
adopted dishonest means of bilking their clients and society. But contrary
to the popular view, in my experience the majority of lawyers are honest
and hardworking. And they are as confused and troubled as nonlawyers over
what is happening to their profession.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Confused and troubled. That could describe just about everyone these days.
And this is because we are living in revolutionary times. Remember in your
student days, when you learned about the Industrial Revolution? The move
off the farms, the break-up of extended families, the grimy factories, the
blight of the cifies? This history generally evoked pity for our forebears,
and relief that we were living in more stable times. But the fact is, that
with the dawning of the Information Age we are going through just as much,
if not more, change in our lives as were those troubled souls in the early
19th century. Because we are living it, putting one foot in front of the
other each day as we try to raise our children and do our jobs, it's hard
to put our individual problems in the broader context. This is big-time
social change we are experiencing, but big-time social change, when you
are living it rather than reading about it, necessarily comes slowly, in
stages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently there has been an acknowledgment of the need for fundamental changes
in many of our social institutions. Our businesses were the first place
these fundamental changes were accepted. Following the widespread introduction
of computing technology into private businesses, it became clear that we
needed to organize workers differently. Teams began to replace top-down
management structures. Bosses began to come out of their offices and manage
by walking around. Restructuring and reengineering became the norin rather
than the exception.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it's also become clear to most people that our schools need fundamental
changes. It no longer sounds radical to speak about individualized learning
using the computer, or about changing the classroom setting to have greater
focus on teamwork, and less focus on the teacher as the only source of learning.
These organizational changes in the educational context, like the organizational
changes pervading businesses, are directly the result of our bigger move
as a culture from a factory-based mindset to an infonnation-based mindset.<BR>
<BR>
So what kind of similar organizational changes are happening in the legal
context? Very, very few. It seems that while we can accept major change
in our businesses and our schools, we consider our legal system to be more
sacrosanct. The courts are, after all, a key part of the bedrock foundation
of our society. Fundamental organizational change in our legal system feels
like it could threaten the core of our democratic ways.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But here's the irony. It's actually our refusal to implement fundamental
change in our legal system that could bring down the whole house. Let me
explain why.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this decade, I think most Americans considered their courts to be
places where justice would generally be served. There was a basic belief
that if a wrong had occurred, our court system would redress that wrong
and restore a balance. In the popular media, Perry Mason was the personification
of that faith in our court system. We believed that through incisive questioning,
a good lawyer could ferret out the truth, expose the bad guy, reward the
good guy, and serve justice. Yes, sometimes there were mistakes, but by
and large, for most people the system worked.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, today, a growing number of people believe that our justice
system is unreliable at best and a total farce at worst. Moreover, among
those who are con-fing to share that belief are people who see the system
from the inside: lawyers, judges, and legal scholars. For example, two years
ago, Bill Ide, who was then the President of the American Bar Association,
said this to the ABA membership (and I quote):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Legal institutions created many years ago weren't designed to handle
the complex issues and burdensome caseloads we routinely see in our courtrooms.
What is needed today is nothing short of a revolution in our administration
of justice.... We must remember that it is the existence of and public confidence
in the legal system that has kept our nation at peace with itself. ... Should
the public confidence be lost in the government to be fair and equitable
through our justice system, we will only be sowing and nurturing the seeds
of a real revolution that no one wants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Those were strong words stated over two years ago from an influential person.
And yet, as far as I can tell, they have inspired virtually nothing in the
way of &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in our legal system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a cultural anthropologist whose research focussed on social change, I
have observed that serious social change issues typically smolder quietly
until there is an unexpected event that sparks a bigger fire that results
in change. It may well be that the O.J. Simpson trial has been that event
as applied to changes in our legal system. If nothing else, that trial allowed
a wide spectrum of Americans to see what life inside our court system is
like today. And many of those who watched were appalled, not necessarily
by the outcome but by the process. The endless bickering. The game playing.
The withholding of important infon-nation from the jury. It just didn't
seem right, when all was said and done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, as ABA-President Ide realized, is that when people no longer
believe that their justice system will reliably dispense justice, they take
matters into their own hands. And that is exactly what is beginning to happen
today. At one end of the spectrum, we have the growth of what is called
&quot;alternative dispute resolution,&quot; or &quot;ADR&quot; for short.
ADR is basically a private justice system. Under ADR, two disputing parties
will agree to avoid the courts and go to a private decisionmaker to end
their dispute. It is growing dramatically in popularity, especially in the
business context.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the other end of the spectrum, however, a more frightening event is occurring.
Some groups, such as the militias, have simply written off our established
justice system and substituted their own &quot;peoples' courts.&quot; Similarly,
even within our established courts, a growing number of j@es are simply
ignoring the confusing evidence presented to them and making their decisions
on bases that have little or nothing to do with the facts of the case.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate cure for this problem is not easy. In my view, to cure the
problem in our legal system we will have to do a substantial overhaul of
the adversary system. Yes, I said overhaul. I know this sounds bold, maybe
even heretical, but stop to think about it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The adversary system is about two sides of a dispute being able to tell
their respective stories to a jury. In other words, it's all about information.
That's why we haveinterrogatories, depositions, and testimony at trial --
the purpose is to get information to the decision-makers so that they can
make an infon-ned decision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the adversary system in practice today is remarkably similar to the
adversary system that was created in England at the dawning of the Industrial
era. (And let me add here that the adversary system was itself the result
of a legal reform movement that occurred in response to abuses occurring
in pre-Industrial England, when defendants were not allowed to testify in
their own defense.) Now, as then, there were a plaintiff and defendant,
each <B>with </B>their lawyers, a judge, and jury, and the various rules
of procedure and of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But think how different the rest of our lives are. When the adversary system
was bom, information was simple and relatively sparse. This was before the
time of widespread publishing or broadcasting, before the time we became
specialized into so many different types of business endeavors. This was
also a time when communities were small and relatively cohesive, unlike
today, when we often don't even know the names of our next-door neighbors.
It was certainly before the days of technical expert witnesses (especially
hired technical expert witnesses), laboratory tests, statistical analyses,
and all the other exhaustive and exhausting paraphernalia of modem trials.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To our collective credit, I believe the adversary system served us fairly
well throughout the Industrial era. But now that we are well into the Information
Age, now that we are participating in a global economy fueled by high tech,
that system is clogging up. That's why we now find interrogatories over
100 pages long, and jurors that are hopelessly lost in the face of highly
technical evidence, and depositions that last for weeks, and trials that
are delayed for years. That's why we have come to a point that our legal
processes, far from serving justice, are actually thwarting justice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please don't misunderstand me. My criticism in this respect is not directed
at the new technologies. Far from it -- as you might guess from my present
employment, I am genuinely excited about the changes that the Information
Age is bringing us. Rather, my point is that the legal system is not employing
the new technologies in an intelligent maimer. Just because we now have
word processors and copying machines instead of typewriters and carbon paper
doesn't mean that it is wise for us to be drafting 100 page legal documents.
An excess of information, especially when that excess leads to manipulation,
is every bit as harmful to justice as is a lack of information.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How might we overhaul the adversary system? Here are a few examples that
would apply with respect to civil disputes. First, let's make sure that
civil disputes involving highly technical information are decided by jurors
who themselves are experts. This would avoid the junk science and battles
of the experts that today thoroughly confuse lay jurors.<BR>
Second, let's create more systems that are designed to resolve certain harms
without any adversarial process -- much like we treat workers' compensation
and no-fault insurance claims today.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And, third, let's acknowledge that in the age of specialization, our courts
of general jurisdiction are inefficient. We need more specialized courts,
which will be staffed by judges and administrators who are knowledgeable
in the court's subject matter. Today we have the Tax and Bankruptcy Courts.
Why not create a Business Court? Or a Personal Injury Court? Or an Environmental
Court? For lawyers, the era of the general practitioner ended at least 10
years ago, and today the bar is divided into well over 20 different areas
of expertise. If law and lawyers have had to specialize to reflect our society's
broader reality, why haven't we demanded that our courts and our legal procedures
make the same adaptation?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I know that overhauling the adversary system is not something to be undertaken
lightly. The effort must begin at the highest levels of our state and federal
judiciaries, and constitutional principles must be protected. This is a
most serious job for our courts, but I believe that there is no choice.
To ignore the ugly realities of our present-day legal system is to assure
the ultimate breakdown of that system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To cure our problems, it is also high time to rethink the professional role
of lawyers if lawyers are going to be useful to our society in the Information
age. We need to dramatically revise our law school curricula, starting right
now, in order to teach our young lawyers to be problem solvers rather than
problem creators. In a world of diverse cultures, which is where we inevitably
will be spending more and more of our time in the future, an adversarial
mindset is a liability, not an asset. We need to teach our lawyers how to
facilitate communication, and we need to stop teaching them that human affairs
are always win/lose. In the Information age, we will need our best thinkers,
many of whom are lawyers, to be focussing on how to create win/win solutions
to problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's where each of you also comes in. Don't forget: as paying customers
of lawyers, you have a right to make things better. And I think you also
have a responsibility to make make things better. Are you using the legal
system as a competitive tool, sort of for blackmail, trying to defeat your
foes through weak legal claims? Do you assume that the only way to solve
your problems is through your lawyers, or do you try to solve things more
creatively, without threatening a lawsuit? Do you instruct your lawyers
to be aggressive and overreaching or do you urge them to be pragmatic and
cooperative on your behalf? Most importantly, do you stay involved when
you use a lawyer's services, or do you just let the lawyer dictate the outcome
of your case?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My point here is that lawyers don't operate in a vacuum. They work for you,
and not vice versa. As the client, it is your interests, not your lawyer's,
that are at stake. And every time you misuse -- or condone the misuse --
of the legal system, every time you take advantage of the sorry state of
our adversary system today, you exacerbate the problem. So take this as
a reminder that there are often many better -- and cheaper -- ways to solve
problems than through lawyers and courts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I also urge you to support legal reform efforts. The securities-abuse legislation
that was recently passed over President Clinton's veto is one exwnple, but
there are many other tort-reform bills still before our federal and state
legislators. The media has positioned these bills as business-versus-consumer,
but this misses the whole point. These bills are about stopping some of
the procedural excesses I talked about before. In that respect, they are
only temporary fixes to the adversary-system problems, but they are fixes
nonetheless. Until we can overhaul this old, tired adversary system to meet
the needs of the Information Age, the best we can do is put some temporary
fixes in place. Without them, our faith in our legal system to deliver justice
will surely be further eroded. So these are the ideas I am working on in
my project at Discovery Institute. These are the marching orders I think
we need to give our society if we are to change the adversarial system before
it self-destructs and takes us with it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To judges: participate in streamlining the adversary system. We need a major
overhaul of our procedures, all the way down to revamping the way our courts
of general jurisdiction are organized.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To legislators: set up new incentives in law to promote prompt and more
just resolution of disputes, including through passage of tort reform legislation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To law schools: revise the law school curricula, so that the emphasis is
placed on dispute resolution rather than on adversarial combat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To lawyers: recognize that these changes are necessary if the profession
is going to play any kind of useful role in the Information Age. One reason
so many lawyers are unhappy today is that even they are already questioning
the value of what they do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And to all of us in general: take personal responsibility for helping to
restore justice and balance to our legal system. Stop condoning the use
of the system for extortion and abuse, and participate in the transition
that is ahead of us. Legal reform is not something to fear; it is something
to welcome. Given the legal system's foundation role in our culture, there
is simply no way to have profound technological and social change occurring
all around us and not change the legal system to adapt to those other changes.
Our mutual goal is to make that change as painless as possible.<BR>

Lewis Perelman, a Senior Fellow of Discovery Institute, is one of the nation's
top authorities on education and training. His advocacy of high technology
in the restructuring of what he has called <B>The Learning Enterprise</B>
is expressed in his book, <A HREF="schlsout.html"><B><I>School's Out: Hyperlearning,
the New Technology and the End of Education</I> </B></A>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman, president of Kanbrain Institute, has provided strategic consulting
advice since 1983 to public and private policymakers concerned with technology,
institutional change, human resource, and economic development issues. His
private consulting clients have included IBM, Apple Computer, National Computer
Systems, Hay Group, Ashton-Tate, L.F. Rothschild, National Education Corp.,
the Edison Electric Institute, and other companies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman is the author of the best-selling book <I>School's Out</I> (William
Morrow &amp; Co., 1992; Avon Books, 1993) a study of restructuring education
and training sponsored by twelve U.S. corporations and foundations. He has
produced several other publications on training and education, including
the widely discussed Briefing Papers, <I>&quot;Closing Education's Technology
Gap&quot;</I> (November 1989) and <I>The Acanemia' Deception</I> (April
1990). His report for Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 project, <I>The
American Learning Enterprise in Transition</I>, was published by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (1990). <BR>
<BR>
Perelman coined the phrase <B>The Learning Enterprise</B> to describe the
total universe of education and training in a report with that title published
by the Council of State Planning Agencies in 1985. And his study for the
Western Governors' Association, Human Capital Investment for State Economic
Development (1989), was the first attempt to chart the entire &quot;portfolio&quot;
of a state's many investments in human resource development. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's work in education, training, technology, and economic policy
has been widely discussed in the national press, cited in legislative testimony,
and used in university courses. He has made speeches and presentations of
his work before numerous audiences throughout the United States and in Europe
and Pacific Asia, both live and on radio and television broadcasts. He also
has testified before Congressional, state, and local legislative committees
as well as executive boards and commissions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently an adjunct fellow of the Discovery Institute, from 1981 to 1983
Perelman was a director in the corporate planning department of Holiday
Corp. in Memphis. From 1979 to 1981, he was a senior scientist in the Social
Systems Group at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he was a visiting
scientist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Previously
he held positions at the federal Solar Energy Research Institute, and at
the Colorado Highway Department. He taught physics and mathematics in public
schools in New York and California, and has taught graduate courses at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the George Mason University School
of Business Administration. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's first book, <I>The Global Mind</I> (Mason/Charter, 1976), was
cited one of the year's best scientific-technical books by the Library Journal.
Perelman's writing has appeared in such major publications as <I>Business
Week, Forbes ASAP, WIRED, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Success, Insight, </I>and
the <I>French magazine ACTUEL, a</I>s well as professional journals such
as <I>TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, New Management, Strategic
Planning Management, Planning Review, Human Capital, and Ethics</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman earned his doctorate in administration, planning, and social policy
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He graduated cum laude with
a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York, where he was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in space and atmospheric physics
and applied mathematics at the Goddard Institute and at the Harvard Division
of Engineering and Applied Physics. Perelman resides and works in Washington,
DC. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Discovery Institute's name and logo derive in part from the British
explorer sloop &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on the Thames River in 1789.
Ninetynine feet long and 340 tons, the Discovery sailed the world and explored
the Pacific Northwest and Puget Sound region in the Spring of 1792 under
the command of Captain George Vancouver and 134 sailors. The picture below
is from a drawing by Northwest Marine artist and historian, Hewlitt Jackson.</H3>
