<TITLE>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Homosexual activists often use the power of the government and
media to try to force society to accept their behavior.  But the
homosexual lobby is also active in corporate America.
<P>
Some companies are actively promoting the homosexual agenda through
direct financial support, advertising campaigns and corporate
policies such as extending domestic partner benefits to homosexuals.
<P>
One of the companies most actively pushing the homosexual agenda
is AT&T.  AT&T's pro-homosexual activities include:
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "Homosexual Marriage."</B>  According
to <I>Diversity Digest</I>, a publication of AT&T's Information
Research Center, the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay United Employees
at AT&T (LEAGUE) held a conference in which members were encouraged
to "help devise a legal definition of marriage, so the company
can work on extending domestic partner benefits to employees in
states that do not recognize marriages between same-gender partners"
(<I>Diversity Digest</I> August 1994, p. 10).
<P>
<LI><B> Homosexual Direct Mail Advertising.</B>  Last year AT&T
sent about 70,000 direct mail packages targeted at homosexuals.
 The package included brochures featuring smiling homosexual couples
and a flier about AT&T's homosexual employee group.  The materials
were sent in envelopes decorated with a rainbow-colored telephone
cord and the phrase, "It's time for a change..." (<I>The
Washington Blade</I> June 10, 1994, p. 23).
<P>
<LI><B> Indoctrination of Employees.</B>  AT&T has held workshops
and "diversity training" sessions in an effort to force
employees to accept homosexuality.  The company has used Brian
McNaught's video, <I>On Being Gay,</I> in these workshops.  The
video is filled with misleading claims and presents homosexuality as a normal, healthy lifestyle. 
<P>
McNaught, who has done several workshops for AT&T, shows his
bias against those who hold traditional religious values in his
book, <I>Gay Issues in the Workplace</I>.  McNaught links religious
conviction with hate and bigotry.  He suggests that people who
hold strong religious convictions need "counseling"
(p. 100).  He shows contempt for those who hold traditional family
values by suggesting that these values fuel "anti-gay bias."
<P>
The following endorsement by an AT&T official appears on the
back of McNaught's book:  "Every manager and employee who
takes our course on 'Homophobia in the Workplace' will receive
a copy of this book.  Brian McNaught has an incredible skill in helping people understand
and respond to gay issues in a nonthreatening way" (Sheila
Landers, Personnel Services Manager at AT&T Network Systems).
<P>
AT&T has also urged employees to observe Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week and to place posters and pink triangles on walls to show
that the office is "gay friendly." 
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "The Gay Games."</B>  According to <I>Businessweek</I>
magazine, AT&T helped sponsor a series of sporting events
featuring 11,000 athletes and a budget of $6.5 million.  <I>Businessweek</I>
described the "Gay Games" as "less a series of
sporting events than a nine-day celebration of culture, complete
with parades, plays, music, art shows and food feasts" (<I>Businessweek</I>
July 4, 1994 p. 38).  
<P>
<LI><B> Donations to the Gay Men's Health Crisis.</B>  According
to Brenda Leake of AT&T, the company gave $25,000 to the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in 1992.  Among other things, GMHC distributes
graphic, sexually explicit material to young people in an attempt
to "educate" them about the dangers of AIDS.  The brochures
encourage young people to engage in dangerous and perverse sexual
practices.   
<P>
 <CENTER><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of pro-homosexual policies cite the need to be "tolerant"
of other people.  But the question is not one of civil rights
or ending "bigotry."  Homosexuals have the same rights
as any other Americans, but are seeking special privileges. 
<P>
Christians and other believers in traditional morality are coming
under enormous pressure in AT&T and other corporations to
ignore their most deeply held beliefs.  "Diversity"
sessions that attack or distort scripture and church teachings
constitute religious harassment.
<P>
The real issue is whether or not people will be forced to accept
homosexual behavior, something that no successful culture has
ever done.  Homosexual behavior is not normal or healthy.  Opposition
to the homosexual agenda is not bigotry; it is common sense.
<P>
If you are concerned about AT&T's promotion of the homosexual
agenda, contact them to express your concern.  Tell AT&T that
it is irresponsible to promote an immoral and unhealthy lifestyle.
 AT&T should incorporate policies that strengthen the family,
not undermine it.

<TITLE>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT CONDOM USE?</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT
<BR>CONDOM USE?</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that
condoms, in order to be effective, must be put on prior to genital
contact, must remain intact and, most importantly, must be used
<I>consistently and correctly</I>.  But while millions of dollars
are spent each year on public education campaigns to promote &quot;consistent
and correct&quot; condom usage -- from pamphlets in public health
clinics to AIDS education classes in schools to the recent CDC
public service announcements on both radio and television -- many
Americans still do not use condoms consistently or correctly.
<P><UL>
  <LI> A 1990 study published in the <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> found that most adults in the United States who have
multiple sexual partners do not use condoms consistently.  Among
currently sexually active adults studied, 13 percent had had sex
with more than one partner in the year preceding the study, but
only 8 percent of this group had used condoms consistently.  Moreover,
of the 13 percent of adults who had more than one partner, two-thirds
provided data on primary versus secondary partners, but only 23
percent of these respondents reported using a condom every time
with their nonprimary partners.  (B.C. Leigh, M.T. Temple, and
K.F. Trocki, &quot;The Sexual Behavior of U.S. Adults:  Results
from a National Survey,&quot; <I>American Journal of Public Health</I>,
83:1400-1408, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> The 1988 National Survey of Family Growth found that only
13 percent of the 1,887 never-married, sexually active women aged
15-49 used condoms &quot;consistently.&quot;  It is significant
to note, however, that this survey's definition of &quot;consistent&quot;
use did <I>not</I> mean using a condom for each <I>act</I> of
intercourse, but rather that the woman had used condoms in every
<I>month</I> throughout the reference period.  In addition, only
41 percent of the entire sample of never-married, sexually active
women had <I>ever</I> used a condom.  (L.B. Potter and J.E. Anderson,
&quot;Patterns of Condom Use and Sexual Behavior Among Never-Married
Women,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</I>, 20:201-218,
1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1989 study of patients at a public sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinic found that consistent condom use is rare,
even among populations at high risk.  Of the 300 patients who
participated in the survey, 51 percent of the men and 64 percent
of the women reported having had an STD in the past, and 47 percent
of all subjects were diagnosed with an STD on the day they were
interviewed.  Forty percent also agreed that their sexual behavior put them at risk of HIV
infection.  However,
only 25 percent of respondents had used a condom at the most recent
intercourse, and only 16 percent of black respondents and 13 percent
of Hispanics reported having used a condom at their last sexual
encounter.  The participants appeared to understand the benefits
of using condoms regularly; however, only 60 percent said they
had used a condom at least once in the previous two months.  (H.S.
Weinstock, et al., &quot;Factors Associated with Condom Use in
a High-Risk Heterosexual Population,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted
Diseases</I>, 20:14-20, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1991 study published in <I>Family Planning Perspectives</I>
found that more than half of all unmarried male participants (60
percent of Hispanics and 54 percent of non-Hispanics) had had
two or more heterosexual partners in the year preceding the survey.
 Among married men, 18 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of non-Hispanic
whites had had two or more sexual partners.  However, while 51
percent of Hispanic men and 49 percent of non-Hispanic men did
<I>not</I> always use condoms with their secondary partners, theoretically
putting both themselves and their primary partners at risk, only
20 percent of Hispanic men and 9 percent of non-Hispanic men used
condoms with their primary partners.  (B. Van Oss Martin, C.A.
Gomez, and N. Hearst, &quot;Multiple Heterosexual Partners and
Condom Use Among Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites,&quot; <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I>, 25:170-174, 1993.)</UL>

<TITLE>IMMIGRATION AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>IMMIGRATION
<BR>AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In recent years, the debate over immigration has broadened and
intensified.  A growing segment of the population would like to
reduce or stop the flow of foreigners entering the United States,
while many others want to adhere to America's historic policy
of welcoming newcomers to our shores.
<P>
Ignored in this increasingly bitter debate is the question of
whether or not our immigration policies are friendly to the preservation
and nurture of family life.
<P>
The American family is in trouble.  Over the past three decades,
the rise of divorce, an increase in nonmarital cohabitation, soaring
rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
widespread drug abuse, an epidemic of juvenile crime and the alarming
proportion of out-of-wedlock births provide hard statistical evidence
that this basic social institution is under siege.
<P>
Clearly, many people interested in immigrating to the United States
have an old-world sense of familial loyalty and an unshakable
belief in the sanctity of marriage.  To such people -- and to
existing U.S. citizens -- we owe a commitment to craft immigration
law in a manner that respects and undergirds the marital institution.
<P>
To that end, we have two concerns that we would like to see the
Commission address:
<P>
1)  Current law allows adult children and siblings to apply for
permanent citizenship on the basis of family relationships.  This
essentially well-meaning policy should be reexamined and modified.
<P>
On the surface, the law here seems to work on behalf of families,
allowing adult children to be reunited with parents, and brothers
and sisters to join those siblings who have already immigrated
to this country.  In fact, it imposes hardships on family members
who are in greater need of reunion.  Here's how:
<P>
Since immigration is limited by quotas, the adult children of
U.S. citizens are often admitted to this country while the spouses
and children of green card holders are kept waiting on a distant
shore.
<P>
Because existing preferences for nuclear family relatives of U.S.
citizens are not extended to green card holders, a husband and
wife in one family might be separated for years while an adult brother in another family comes
to the U.S. under a law intended to reunite families.
<P>
To address this problem, the Family Research Council recommends
that current law be modified so that all backlogs in nuclear family
categories be cleared before adult children and siblings are granted
entry under family reunification status.  (It may even be well
to consider eliminating the preference for adult children and
siblings altogether, since backlogs in those categories are already
so large.)  Giving preference to all nuclear family relationships
would allow more spouses and minor children to enter as family
members -- and American family life would be strengthened correspondingly.
<P>
2)  Current law has been implemented inappropriately as cohabiting
couples and same-sex couples have been admitted on temporary visas
under the rubric of &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
While current law does not recognize such couples as &quot;family,&quot;
the federal government reportedly has allowed this interpretation
in cases of temporary visas.  The continuation of this practice
would mean that:
<P>
<LI> The number of cohabiting couples in the United States would
increase, albeit temporarily, as the result of official immigration
action;
<P>
<LI> The number of homosexual couples would also increase with the
official sanction of the INS;
<P>
<LI> The precedent set by such a practice might well be used in the
future to justify similar action in the case of permanent immigration.
<P>
In order to eliminate this practice -- which undermines the sanctity
of marriage and the stability of family life in America -- the
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform should call upon the appropriate
federal agencies and congressional oversight committees to take
whatever steps necessary to ensure that non-marital couples are
not granted visas as a &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The current larger debate over immigration might well be tempered
if immigration policy were more deliberately crafted to encourage
the immigration of families and those most likely to support traditional
family values.
<P>
Many of the problems we face as a nation can be attributed, either
directly or indirectly, to the breakdown of family life.
<P>
To be successful, immigration policy should support family values
rather than contribute to their further erosion.  An overtly pro-family
stance on the part of the INS and other government agencies would
ease the fears of those who believe that our borders should be
closed completely to avoid the further collapse of American society.
<P>
The importance of stable marriages and families to the health
of a nation cannot be underestimated.  The late Pitirim Sorokin,
chairman of Harvard's Sociology Department and President of the
International Institute of Sociology, warned Americans nearly
40 years ago that the decline in family life must be reversed
or America would go the way of other nations that suffered cultural
breakdown.  In 1956, he wrote in <I>The American Sex Revolution</I>
(Boston: Porter Sargent Publisher): 
<P>
<UL><I>...marriage has been regarded by all societies as the culminating
point of human existence, and as the most decisive factor in the
survival and well-being of the societies themselves....the candle
of the American marriage and family is being burned at both ends
-- both as a union of husband and wife, and as a union of parents
and children.  And with their disintegration, marriage and the
family progressively fail in the performance of tasks of maintaining
the well-being of the individual and ensuring the survival of
the nation itself.</I></UL>
<P>
Immigrants like Sorokin (a refugee from the Soviet Union) have
contributed immeasurably to the moral health of the United States.
 We should make certain that, regardless of how the current debate
over influx is resolved, our nation's immigration policies are
always structured to ensure the survival and continuing strength
of America's families.

<TITLE>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN<BR>OF TABLE 34</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In 1948, zoologist Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his
study <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>.  In 1953 a companion
volume, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>, was published.
 Although many scientists were critical of Kinsey's methods, the
media popularized Kinsey's findings. But serious questions have
been raised about Kinsey's research:
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of fraudulent data and child sexual abuse.</B>
The book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court,
Muir; Huntington House, 1990) shows that either the Kinsey data
on child sexuality were manufactured or that children were sexually
abused in the name of science.  Table 34 in Kinsey's study contains
detailed data about molestation of young boys.  According to a
review in the British medical journal, <I>The Lancet,</I> the
authors of <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> &quot;demolish&quot; Kinsey's
credibility.
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of improper sampling. </B> Kinsey relied heavily
on data gleaned from prison inmates, including sex offenders,
and extrapolated those findings to the general population.  Although
criminals made up less than one percent of the population, inmates
made up a sizable portion of Kinsey's male sample. 
<P>
<LI><B> Issue of &quot;volunteer&quot; error raised -- and ignored.
</B> Esteemed colleagues of Kinsey such as psychologist Abraham
Maslow warned Kinsey that his survey suffered greatly from &quot;volunteer
bias.&quot;  Maslow told Kinsey that such surveys tend to be skewed
toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Kinsey ignored
the advice and terminated their collegial relationship.
<P>
Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many ongoing federally-sponsored
programs.  His conclusions have permeated America's educational
institutions and are the major behavioral model on which sex education
programs are designed.  The Kinsey ideology has affected everything
from sex offender laws to the sexual portrayal of children in
pornographic publications.
<P>
The reliance on reports of sexual abuse of children under the
auspices of federally-supported research demands investigation.
 FRC's new video, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot; asks such
important questions as:   
<P>
<LI><B> How were the children procured for the experiments?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Where are the children now?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Did the parents of the children give consent to the experiments?</B>
<P>
It is essential that these and other questions be answered by
the Kinsey Institute and the surviving associates of Dr. Kinsey.

<P>
*  Two wrongs don't make a right.  It is foolish to fight abortion
by embracing welfare subsidies.  There are no data to support
the contention that the current welfare system suppresses the
abortion rate -- in the short-term or the long-term.  In fact,
the welfare state peacefully coexists with the world's highest
abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
<P>
*  All the data demonstrate that subsidizing illegitimacy will
actually increase the number of abortions because it increases
promiscuity and discourages marriage.  Illegitimacy and abortion
spring from the same misconception that life is cheap and motherhood
bears no sacred responsibility.                         
<P><UL>
The correlation between abortion and illegitimacy in a state-by-state
analysis is astronomically high (between .67 and .72, with 1.0
designating a perfect correlation).  Likewise, abortion and illegitimacy
trends track together over time.
<P>
 States that have more generous welfare benefits also have higher
abortion rates.  When the 50 states are organized into quintiles,
for example, the rank order correlation between abortions per
1,000 live births and average monthly AFDC benefits is perfect.
<P>
 Welfare promotes family disintegration, and girls who are born
out-of-wedlock are much more likely to engage in premarital sex.
 Premarital sex is 9 times more likely to engender abortion, and
women who have never married are more than 5 times as likely to
have abortions as their married counterparts. 
<P></UL>
*  State by state analysis demonstrates that small changes in
welfare payouts do not appear to correlate closely with short-run
changes in the abortion rate.  Texas, for example, experienced
a 27% drop in abortions in the 1980s, while welfare payouts remained
consistently low relative to the national average.
<P>
*  The termination of benefits may in fact reduce the number of
abortions in the short-term because many pregnant young women
will turn to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.  Teenagers will
be more likely to remain at home with parents, and parental notification
laws have proven effective in reducing the number of abortions.
<P>
*  Abortions are less likely to increase in the short-term because
many low-income girls deliberately choose to have a baby.  Abortion
would deny them an important status symbol.  Surveys also demonstrate
that moral opposition to abortion is strongest among the poor.
<P>
*  The logic of pro-life opposition to welfare reform is that
we should increase entitlements tenfold in order to save even
more lives and that we should forgo any crackdown on deadbeat
dads, since more men might pressure more women into abortions.
 Pro-lifers should support marriage and adoption, instead of opposing
welfare reform.
<P>
*  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on demand requires more
than legal reform.  The question we should be asking is &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;  The answer certainly includes
welfare reform that reduces illegitimacy.

<H2>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Today, nearly one out of three children is born out of wedlock,
as opposed to one in ten in 1970.  If current trends continue,
by the year 2015 half of all American children will be born to
a single mother.
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, 1.2 million births were illegitimate -- the highest
number ever reported in the U.S.  In 1993, 6.3 million children
were living with a single parent who had never married.  In 1960,
the number was 243,000.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among black Americans was 26% in 1965.
 Today the rate is 68% and climbing.  In inner cities, the figure
is typically in excess of 80%.  Only 6% of black children born
in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18, according
to some projections.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among white Americans has risen tenfold,
from 2.29% in 1960 to 22% today -- almost the same as the black
illegitimacy rate in the early 1960s that motivated Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to write his famous report on the breakdown of the black
family.  The figure in low-income, working-class white communities
may already be twice that.  According to the latest Census Bureau
runs, the illegitimate birth rate in many white communities now
exceeds 40%, and out-of-wedlock births are increasing more rapidly
among whites than minorities.
<P>
<LI>  Women with college degrees contribute only 4% of white illegitimate
babies, while women  with a high school education or less contribute
82%.  Women with family incomes of $75,000  or more contribute
1% of white illegitimate babies, while women with family incomes
under $20,000 contribute 69%.  For white women below the poverty
line in the year prior to giving birth, 44% of births have been
illegitimate, as opposed to only 6% for women above the poverty
line.
<P>
<LI>  In 1992, 30% of all non-marital births were to females under
the age of 20.  The federal government has a particular interest
in preventing unwed teenage childbearing because teen mothers
who enter the welfare system are far more likely than older mothers
to rely on government to support their children and to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
<LI>  By 1992, 71% of teen mothers were unmarried -- a more than
doubling of the rate in just one generation.  In 1970, the proportion
of teen mothers who were unmarried was 30%.  In 1950, 14% of births
to teenagers were to unmarried mothers.
<P>
<LI>  Almost half of unwed teen mothers go on welfare within one
year after the birth of a first child.  By the time the baby is
age 5, 72% of white teens and 84% of black teens have received
AFDC. 
<P>
<LI>  Nearly one out of five teens who have a premarital pregnancy
will become pregnant again within one year.  More than 31% experience
a second pregnancy within two years.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY'S DISASTROUS EFFECTS</H2>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Out of wedlock pregnancy is a near certain predictor of poverty.
 The one-parent family is six times more likely to be poor than
the two-parent family.
<P>
 
<LI>  Women who bear illegitimate children (especially before finishing
high school) are far more likely to rely on government to support
their children and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled.
<P>
<LI>  Children born outside of marriage are three times more likely
to depend on welfare themselves when they reach adulthood.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy feeds itself.  Young white women who grow up without
a father in the home are more than twice as likely to bear children
out of wedlock.  And boys living in a single-parent family are
twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as boys from
intact homes.
<P>
<LI>  More than 70% of all juveniles in state reform institutions
come from fatherless homes.  The relationship between crime and
one-parent families is so powerful that controlling for family
structure erases the relationship between crime and race or poverty.
<P>
<LI>  The likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<P>
<LI>  The greater the incidence of single-parent families in a neighborhood,
the higher the incidence of violent crime and burglary.
<P>
<LI>  Teenage single-parent mothering is the single greatest contributor
to low birth weight babies.  Studies show that the high rate of
out-of-wedlock births to young mothers is the primary explanation
for America's low international standing on measures of infant
mortality.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are much more likely to experience
abuse or neglect.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are more likely to experience
impaired physical development and low cognitive/verbal development.
 Among children aged 3-5 in one study, those with teen mothers
were twice as likely to have few children's books in the home.
<P>
<LI>  Children from single-parent families are two to three times
more likely to have emotional or behavioral problems than children
from intact families.  They also exhibit weaker peer adjustment
and a weaker sense of right and wrong.
<P>
<LI>  Children from fatherless homes have lower educational aspirations
and a low level of educational achievement.  Studies also show
that illegitimacy reduces job performance, professional attainment,
individual income, and the overall health of the economy.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY TALKING POINTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The essential purpose of welfare reform must be to reduce illegitimacy.
 A system that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy
-- and poverty.  
<P>
<LI>  Welfare is bondage:  women bear illegitimate children in exchange
for benefits that can never compare with the benefits of an intact
family.
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of grants to unwed teenage mothers is necessary
to restore the integrity of the family unit for future generations.
 Even Frances Perkins, the most liberal member of the Roosevelt
Administration, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried
mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would
escalate family breakdown.
<P>
<LI>  As the one policy option that promises to effect change in
the current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.
<P>
<LI>  We are combatting not material poverty, but a poverty of the
spirit.  Every individual, regardless of income level, is capable
of moral autonomy.  Welfare is demeaning because it denies that
truth.
<P>
<LI>  Even Democrats now concede Dan Quayle was right.  Families
bestow advantages that simply come no other way.
<P>
<LI>  Every individual deserves equal access to the privilege of
family, and welfare denies its recipients that privilege.  In
communities where illegitimacy has reached a critical mass, many
children don't even have the opportunity to see what a family
looks like, much less live in one.
<P>
<LI>  By eroding our nation's moral capital, illegitimacy jeopardizes
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  If citizens
cannot govern their own lives, how can they govern the republic?
<P>
<LI>  The role of the two-parent family is essential in sustaining
a free society because it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted
from generation to generation.  Only a virtuous people can be
free.  Welfare erodes first the freedom of dependents and then
freedom at large. 
<P>
<LI>  If we succeed in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work, we will still be left with roughly the same number of fatherless
children.  If current trends continue, one of every two babies
will be born to a single mother within the next 20 years.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy is not a race issue.  Out-of-wedlock births are
increasing more rapidly among whites, and the illegitimacy rate
in many white communities now exceeds 40%.

<TITLE>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE KINSEY RESEARCH</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE
<BR>KINSEY RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Since the publication of <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>
(1948) and <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I> (1953) there
has been much criticism of the findings and methods of Dr. Alfred
Kinsey. 
<P>
The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court
and Muir; Lochinvar-Huntington House) examined the work of Dr.
Kinsey.  The book revealed a number of serious flaws in his research,
including shocking evidence that Kinsey used data from the sexual
abuse of children.
<P>
According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of problems in Kinsey's
research is "compelling.... disturbing...and requires investigation."[1]
 Problems include:
<P>
<LI> <B>Sexual Experiments on Children --</B> The Kinsey male report
contains data on sexual activity of 317 children aged 2 months
to 15 years.  These data were either manufactured or these children
were sexually molested by adults in the name of science.  The
data are contained in graph tables which chronicle attempts to
bring children to "orgasm."
<P>
<LI> <B>Sampling Errors --</B> Kinsey's sample was entirely voluntary
and not representative of the U.S. population.  White people were
overrepresented while Blacks and Latinos were underrepresented.
 In addition, college students, college graduates, and white-collar
workers were overrepresented.  Prison inmates comprised 25 percent
of Kinsey's male sample, even though they made up less than one
percent of the total U.S. population at the time.  Among women,
58 percent of Kinsey's sample were unmarried, three times the
actual number at the time.  Religious people were not adequately
represented and since only 10 states were included, the survey
was regionally skewed.
<P>
<LI> <B>Volunteer Error --</B> Psychologist Abraham Maslow raised
this issue by pointing out that sex surveys are skewed toward
the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Many people, especially
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not willing to talk openly
about their most intimate lives.  Those who did often exaggerated.
 Maslow proved the volunteer error in a test he conducted at Brooklyn
College and concluded that "the whole basis for Kinsey's
statistics was proven to be shaky."[2] 
<P>
Further evidence of Maslow's contention that sex surveys are inherently
slanted is found in a book written by Wardell Pomeroy, one of
Kinsey's co-authors.  Pomeroy writes:

<P>
"As types, those who took the most romantic view of sex were,
understandably, people who were the most religious -- clergymen
and their wives especially.  Those who were bubbling over to tell
us everything they could were usually homosexuals, particularly
when they discovered by our use of homosexual argot that we knew
about the kind of lives they led.  They would almost visibly expand
with relief and eagerness to talk."[3]
<P>
<LI> <B>Intimidation/Coaching of Respondents --</B> Kinsey instructed
his interviewers to goad their subjects into revelations of their
sexual behavior, especially if the results didn't match the interviewer's
assumptions. Wardell Pomeroy admitted that such coaching was quite
common in the Kinsey team's data collection.[4]  These tactics were
particularly effective with prison inmates.  If the inmates did
not provide answers they would have to return to their cells,
thus losing access to the free candy, soft drinks and cigarettes
provided by the Kinsey interviewers.
<P>
When some interviewees said that they did not do a particular
sex act, the interviewer would say: "Yes, I know you have
never done that, but how old were you the <I>first</I> time that
you did it?"[5] 
<P>
Kinsey's team intimidated subjects when they suspected that the
subject was being dishonest.  According to Kinsey, the interviewers
"...should denounce the subject with considerable severity..."[6]
Kinsey admitted that these tactics were highly unusual: "Such
an attack on a dishonest subject is quite contrary to the usual
rules for interviewing, and a procedure which we at first hesitated
to employ in the present study.  We have, however, decided that
it is a necessary technique in dealing with some individuals."[7]
  
<P>
<LI> <B>Ideological Bias --</B> According to Kinsey biographer Paul
Robinson, Kinsey consistently favored nontraditional forms of
sexuality in the way he constructed his books.  Marital intercourse
was "rudely confined to a single chapter in the back of the
book, where it received about one-third the attention devoted
to homosexual relations... a remarkable feat of sexual leveling...the
fundamental categories of his analysis clearly worked to undermine
the traditional sexual order."[8] A 1989 National Academy of
Sciences report explained that Kinsey "attempted to counter
the traditional religious view that sexual virtue was entirely
composed of heterosexual activity...inside the bonds of marriage..."[9]
Kinsey himself summarized the Old Testament's and the Talmud's
injunctions against sexual relations with animals by saying: "The
student of human folkways is inclined to see a considerable body
of superstition in the origins of all such taboos..."[10]
<P>
In addition to Dr. Walter Stewart and Dr. Abraham Maslow, critics
of the Kinsey reports include a committee appointed by the Commission
on Statistical Standards of the American Statistical Association.
 In 1954 the committee reported several statistical flaws and
concluded that "Kinsey should have been more cautious in
boldly drawing highly precise conclusions from their limited sample."[11]
<P>
The 1989 National Academy of Sciences report warned that the sampling
flaws limited "the comparability and appropriateness of the
Kinsey data as a basis for calculating the prevalence of any form
of sexual conduct."[12]
<P>
The Kinsey data are flawed and have been contradicted by subsequent
research.  However, Kinsey's work continues to be widely used
by policy makers and the culture at large in dealing with sexuality.
 The Kinsey data must be discarded.

<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-two years after its release, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</I> by Alfred C. Kinsey remains a highly influential document
in government funding of sex education and health programs despite
a general understanding that its research methods were unscientific.
 The Kinsey ideology has altered the nation's legal codes for
sex crimes and has been used as a touchstone for numerous federal
policies, particularly the funding of sex education, research,
and prevention programs for AIDS, drug abuse, and youth suicide.
 
<P>
<LI>  Based on the Kinsey ideology that premarital sexuality is superior
to marriage-based sex, federally-funded sex and health education
curricula have been geared almost entirely toward sexually active
teens, implying that abstinence before marriage is abnormal. 
The federal government began funding adolescent pregnancy prevention
programs during the 1970's under Title X of the Public Health
Service Act.  Curricula funded through Title X often include ideas
and "facts" derived from the Kinsey studies.  After
$3 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, America's teenage pregnancy
rate is far higher than when the programs began.  And there is
growing evidence that such programs actually increase sexual activity
among teens.[1] Yet the programs, which emphasize how teens should
engage in sex rather than why they shouldn't, continue to receive
heavy subsidies from taxpayers.  In fiscal 1995, the federal government
will spend $190.4 million on Title X projects.  By contrast, the
Adolescent Family Life Act, or Title XX of the Public Health Service
Act, whose abstinence-based programs reduce teen pregnancies,[2]
is slated to receive only $6.7 million in federal funds in fiscal
1995.
<P>
Planned Parenthood receives about $50 million annually from Title
X grants.  This money is used to design and implement sex education
and health programs for thousands of schools across America and
to operate clinics.  Giving lip service to the idea of abstinence
before marriage, Planned Parenthood-designed programs openly support
sexual experimentation.  For instance:
<P>
1)  An adolescent curriculum prepared for the Alameda-San Francisco
branch of Planned Parenthood tells young people that it is a "myth"
that "[y]oung women who have more than one sexual partner
are easy.  Some people, both men and women, prefer to relate sexually
to more than one person at a time.  This is an individual preference."[3]
 

<P>
2)  The Planned Parenthood Center of Syracuse, New York, issued
a pamphlet for teens that says:  "Many people believe that sex relations
are right only when they are married.  Others decide to have sex outside of marriage. 
This is a personal choice."[4]
<P>
3)  In a family planning magazine published under a federal grant,
a Planned Parenthood affiliated physician gives this advice to
teens:  "If we have sex for our own reasons, then there is
nothing wrong with sexual activities."[5]
<P>
4)  In 1991, Planned Parenthood of Maryland joined several government
agencies to sponsor the Affirming Diversity Conference.  Conference
coordinator John Hannay told an interviewer:  "We use the
Kinsey studies as a starting point to determine how many youth
would fall into this [child homosexuality] category.  As the cross
section of society goes, you would probably expect to see a good
10% will have predominantly or exclusively homosexual tendencies...
There haven't been any studies done on sexual orientation among
adolescents, so we're just going on estimates on adults and the
10 percent figure.  The thing is that many students will be aware
that they are different, but they would probably not describe
their difference as being a homosexual."[6]
<P>
<LI>  AIDS prevention programs are funded through grants from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  In fiscal 1989, the CDC
spent $266.6 million on AIDS education.[7]  In fiscal 1995, the
CDC is spending $589 million on HIV/AIDS projects, plus another
$105 million on sexually transmitted diseases.  This amounts to
about a third of CDC's total $2.1 billion budget.[8]
<P>
<LI>  The Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS) is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, which gave SIECUS two grants totalling $360,397 in fiscal
1994.[9] One of the founding board members of SIECUS was Wardell
B. Pomeroy, a co-author of the 1948 Kinsey male sexuality study.
 In 1980, another SIECUS co-founder, Mary Calderone, told a group
of doctors that the primary goal of SIECUS was to educate society
"very broadly and deeply with the awareness of the vital
importance of infant and childhood sexuality."[10]
<P>
A 1985 SIECUS report says:  "...homosexuality is an essential
quality of humanness, and that its expression is the right of
every human being."  In March 1991, SIECUS published a report,
"Winning the Battle:  Developing Support for Sexuality and
HIV/AIDS Education."  The report suggests that one way to
deal with opponents of some types of sex education is to determine
their religious affiliation and publicize it in order to stigmatize
them.[11] SIECUS also advocates the teaching of "alternative
lifestyles" and the use of "values clarification"
to help youth "question, explore, and assess sexual attitudes
and feelings in order to develop their own values..."[12]
<P>
Debra Haffner, executive director of SIECUS, in a 1988 SIECUS
report says:  "Colleagues and I have fantasized about a national
'petting project' for teenagers... to help them learn courting
behaviors and to, once again, give teens time to learn slowly
about their sexuality... Today's teens also need to have that
opportunity for unpressured discovery of sexual feelings and responses...
A partial list of safe sex practices for teens could include...
massaging, caressing, undressing each other, masturbation alone,
masturbation in front of a partner, and mutual masturbation."[13]
<P>
In a 1990 SIECUS report, Haffner asked readers to "Imagine
a world where:  School sexuality education is compulsory.  Contraceptives
are readily available.  Abortion is free until the 18th week of
pregnancy.  There is a law that states that, 'Cohabitation between
people of the same sex is entirely acceptable from society's point
of view.'... I was most impressed by the sense that in Sweden
sexuality is truly accepted as a natural and healthy part of living.
 Young people have a right to their sexual feelings and to sexual
education."[14]  
<P>
<P>
<LI>  In 1950, Alfred Kinsey testified before the California Assembly's
Subcommittee on Sex Crimes on behalf of liberalizing state laws
regarding sex offenders.  Kinsey argued specifically for granting
immediate paroles to child molesters and also counseled that parents
should not warn children about strangers because it might frighten
them.  In his testimony, he included little or no information
about sex crime victims, and noted that societal disapproval of
the acts posed more harm that the acts themselves.[15]  Kinsey also
worked with other state legislatures to liberalize sex crime laws
and openly called for changes in molestation laws in his second
study, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>:  "It is
difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed
at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even
more specific sexual contacts."[16]  
<P>
<LI>  Following the advice of such a prominent scientist, federal
and state officials began altering the penalties for molestation
and other sex crimes, as noted in a paper by Dr. Judith Reisman.
 In 1977 and 1985, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Survey
of Crime Severity, a perennial list of more than 200 crimes that
is used by the legal community to establish sentencing guidelines,
omitted child rape, child pornography, and child prostitution
as serious crimes.[17]
<P>
Writing in <I>Scientific Monthly</I> in 1955, law enforcement
scholar Morris L. Ernst explains Kinsey's importance:  "The
Kinsey report is the single greatest contribution of science to
the rule-making part of the law in my lifetime."[18]  
<P>
<LI>  The Kinsey influence also extends into federally-funded projects
at sex research institutes, including the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which was founded by
Kinsey at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana in 1947.
 Indiana University provides support to the Kinsey Institute,[19]
and the Institute also provides support to federally-funded researchers.

<P>
Former Kinsey Institute Director June Machover Reinisch was awarded
three grants from the National Institutes of Health totalling
more than $3 million from 1981 to 1989.[20]  In 1989, the <I>Chicago
Tribune</I> reported that the National Institutes of Health launched
an investigation into "how millions of federal research grant
dollars were spent" by Reinisch.  In the case of one grant
for $658,307 from the National Institutes of Child Health and
Human Development, an NIH investigator found "no financial
illegalities" but did find that payments made to a subcontracted
researcher had been placed in a special bank account under the
names of the Kinsey Institute, Reinisch, and another Kinsey employee.[21]
 "This procedure is unconventional and highly questionable,"
the report stated.[22]  The bank account was closed "as a result
of the initial internal review conducted by the University."[23]
<P>
Another example of a federally-funded researcher under Kinsey
auspices is Howard B. Kaplan, co-author of a chapter in the Kinsey
Institute's 1990 book, <I>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality:  Concepts
of Sexual Orientation</I>.  Kaplan received a grant for this work
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the Centers for Disease
Control.[24]
<P>
In 1987, two federal agencies -- the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development -- sponsored The Fourth Kinsey Symposium,
titled, "AIDS and Sex:  An Integrated Biomedical and Biobehavioral
Approach."  The conference, which was also sponsored by the
host organization, the Kinsey Institute, was co-chaired by Bruce
Voeller, the late homosexual activist who was president of the
Mariposa Education and Research Foundation of Topanga, California.
 A conference statement describes Mariposa's purpose:  "to
foster a society more honest and at ease with its own sexuality.
. ."[25]  According to <I>Who's Who in America</I>, former
Kinsey Institute President June Reinisch is also affiliated with
Mariposa.[26]
<P>
<LI>  One of the most common myths derived from Kinsey's research
is the estimate that 10 percent of the population is homosexual.
 Until recently this figure has been accepted without question.
<P>
The overblown 10 percent figure is actually an exaggeration of
Kinsey's claim.  Kinsey said that 10 percent of males are homosexual
for at least three years during a portion of their lives.  For
females, Kinsey said, the figure was less than five percent. 
Homosexual activists along with the media repeatedly cited the
10 percent figure and it was generally accepted by the culture.
<P>
The figure has been used to lobby for homosexual affirmation programs,
the extension of family benefits to homosexual employees of corporations,
and to frighten elected officials and business leaders into believing
that they have to accommodate a sizable minority.
<P>
A huge body of evidence has emerged challenging the 10 percent
figure.  Studies from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Norway,
Denmark and other nations show a homosexuality prevalence of one
percent or less.[27]

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

<TITLE>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<BODY>

<P>
<H2>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
Congress should restore the original intent of the Hyde Amendment, preserving
states' and voters' rights to set limitations on the use of taxpayer
funds to pay for certain abortions.  
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  Since 1976,
Congress has annually approved the Hyde Amendment, named for its
original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), which bans the use of
federal Medicaid funds for abortion except when the life of the
mother is endangered.  In 1993, Hyde's exception clause was expanded
to include cases of rape and incest.  The expansion was reluctantly
agreed upon by  many pro-lifers so that President Clinton's attempt
to repeal the Hyde Amendment altogether could be successfully
halted.  Also, House floor debate made it clear that these &quot;rape
and incest&quot; exceptions were only intended to be options for
states because many states' laws prohibit the taxpayer funding
of abortion.
<P>
However, in December 1993, the Clinton administration
issued a series of directives which &quot;interpreted&quot; the
revised Hyde Amendment as a mandate that states <B>must</B> provide and
co-fund Medicaid abortions in the cases of rape and incest.  Under
Clinton's  directive, the abortionist may simply make the unverifiable
assertion that a woman is the victim of rape or incest but is
unable, for physical or <I>psychological</I> reasons, to comply with
a reporting or documentation requirement.  Any state which refused
to comply, the directives said, would risk losing <B>all</B> federal
Medicaid funding.  At the time the directives were issued, 32
states had laws or regulations prohibiting public funding for
abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered.
 Many of these states' laws were passed by public referendum (rather
than by state legislatures).  And yet, since that time, many states
have been forced to repeal or change their laws -- either through
legislative action or court order.
<P>
In fact, Arkansas' and Colorado's
constitutional amendments prohibiting state funding of abortion
except when the life of the mother is endangered -- an amendment
supported by then-Governor Clinton -- were struck down <B><I>in their
entirety</I></B> by a federal court, opening the door to state funding
of abortion on demand. 
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  Several members of
Congress have sought to restore the pre-Clinton intent of the
Hyde Amendment to respect states' (and voters') rights.  Spearheaded
by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.),
the Exon-Istook Amendment would preserve the rights of states
to opt for or against state taxpayer provision and funding of
abortion in cases of rape and incest, thereby rescinding the Clinton
administration's mandate to the states.
<P>
The first
attempt to include the Exon-Istook Amendment in the "Rescissions
Bill" earlier this year failed due to pro-abortion Republicans
threatening to vote against the important rescissions package
unless the Exon-Istook Amendment was dropped.  However, the Exon-Istook
Amendment will be re-introduced in Congress this summer as an
attachment to and clarification of the Hyde Amendment.  The Hyde
Amendment has been annually offered by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.)
as an amendment to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes
before Congress for a vote every summer.
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>  The prospects
are hopeful that the Exon-Istook Amendment will be passed by both
Congressional houses if it is included with the Hyde Amendment
in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill this summer.  But expect
the same pro-abortion Republicans as well as the heavy rhetoric
of the Clinton administration to try to thwart the passage of
the Exon-Istook Amendment.

<TITLE>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF
<BR>ABORTION THROUGH THE
<BR>FEDERAL EMPLOYEE 
<BR>HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
Currently, federal taxpayer
dollars are being used to fund abortions for federal employees
through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
 Congress should seek to end such funding by amending the Treasury/Postal
Service Appropriations Act.
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program covers about 9 million federal government employees
(including dependents and retirees).  It provides enrollees with
a broad selection of private health insurance plans, offering
a rich menu of between 18 and 35 individual benefit packages.
 Monies for the FEHBP are allocated through the Treasury and Postal
Service Appropriations Act, and the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) administers the program as the sole negotiator of health
benefits for federal employees.
<P>
Federal taxpayer dollars fund the
greater portion of employee health benefits.  The government contributes
about 60 percent of the funds needed to purchase each employee's
health insurance.  In some plans, the federal contribution is
much higher (e.g., the government's share of the premium for Kaiser
HMO is 75 percent).
<P>
In 1980, before the Smith-Ashbrook Amendment
was instituted, the Office of Personnel Management reported that
an estimated $9 million in taxpayers' money was spent to pay for
17,000 abortions.
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  In 1983, the Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment was passed in the Treasury/Postal Service Appropriations
bill, prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions
for federal employees enrolled in the FEHBP.
<P>
The Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>Sec. A:  &quot;No funds appropriated
by this Act shall be available to pay for an abortion, or the
administrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the federal employees health
benefit program
which provides any benefits or coverage for abortions.&quot; </UL>
<UL>Sec.
B:  &quot;The provision of section A shall not apply where the
life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried
to term.&quot; </UL>
<P>
However, in 1993, through the urging of the Clinton
Administration, pro-abortion members in Congress proposed and
passed a bill which did not include the longtime restriction on
abortion coverage in federal employee health plans (207-206 in
the House, 73-27 in the Senate).  And on October 28, 1993, President
Clinton signed H.R. 2403 into law (P.L. 103-123), folding abortion
coverage into the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>
 The FEHBP bill was able to pass in 1993 because it was introduced
in Congress almost simultaneously with the Clinton Administration's
proposal to repeal the Hyde Amendment.  As a result, most pro-lifers
concentrated their efforts to preserve Hyde.  The sole attempt
to counter FEHBP's expansion sought to permit abortion coverage
only through a separate rider to federal employee health benefit
plans.  This attempt, spearheaded by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.),
was defeated by only three votes (48-51).
<P>
The makeup of Congress
today, however, is quite different from what it was in 1993. 
The current pro-life majorities in both Houses of Congress make
it possible to introduce and pass a Smith/Ashbrook-type of amendment
this summer when the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill comes
up for a vote.

<TITLE>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S
<BR>WAR ON THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<CENTER>
<P>
<I>by</I>
<P>

</CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Service Corporation (LSC) is an independent, nonprofit
corporation funded by the federal government to the tune of $415
million a year.  LSC's purported purpose is to provide poor people
access to expensive legal services.  But, actually, LSC has become
a deep well for anti-family litigation.  By using carefully-selected
&quot;test cases&quot; in carefully selected courts, liberal activists
have used the LSC to litigate their agenda, sidestepping democracy
and the legislative process.
<P>
Since 1974, LSC has spent $5 billion working against the interests
of the family on many fronts.  Following are some examples:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PROMOTING ABORTION AND DIVORCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Services Act, as amended in 1977 and in subsequent appropriations
acts, prohibited LSC from being involved in abortion related cases.
 Nonetheless, LSC has remained firmly committed to abortion on
demand and has worked around the law in an attempt to secure unlimited,
taxpayer-funded abortions.  In several cases throughout the country,
LSC has worked against waiting periods, parental consent, parental
notification and spousal notification.
<P>
In <I>Planned Parenthood Association, Inc. v. Department of Human
Resources, </I>Oregon Legal Services represented Planned Parenthood
in a challenge to a limitation on the number of elective abortions
that the state's medical assistance program would fund.  LSC argued
that poor women should have access to an unlimited number of taxpayer-funded
abortions.[1]  LSC took a similar line in a Pennsylvania case, arguing
that such limitations were an unconstitutional infringement of
a woman's right to have an unlimited number of abortions.[2]   In
another Pennsylvania case, LSC filed a class action suit to discard
parental consent for minors and spousal consent.[3]
<P>
In testimony on the reauthorization of LSC, Linda Jones of Concerned
Women for America of California testified that LSC has been involved
in most major abortion cases.  According to Jones, &quot;The list
reads like a virtual hall of fame for abortion rights litigation.&quot; [4]
<P>
LSC seems to be more interested in facilitating divorce in troubled
families than in helping to repair them.  An example of LSC's
lack of commitment to keeping families intact is their view on
mediation. The National Center on Women and Family Law, an LSC-funded
center, argues that mediation, one important means of resolving
domestic disputes, should be avoided because the woman is always
at a disadvantage.[5]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>EXPANDING WELFARE, SUBSIDIZING DESTRUCTIVE
BEHAVIOR</H3></CENTER>
<P>
LSC has also been active in blocking attempts to reform welfare
and in increasing the number of people dependent on public assistance
programs.  In the case of <I>C.K. v. Shalala,</I>[6] LSC joined the
ACLU and the National Organization of Women's Legal Defense Fund
in a class action suit to block New Jersey's law capping welfare
payments to mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
 LSC argued that such a law was an unconstitutional violation
of a woman's right to procreate at will.  LSC has filed similar
suits against California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas and Maine.
<P>
Lawsuits filed by LSC have also helped to subsidize the destructive
habits of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC has
helped some 250,000 substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AIDING THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In the case of <I>Rush v. Parham,</I>[8] the Atlanta Legal Aid Society,
an LSC grantee, tried to force the state of Georgia to pay for
a sex change operation.  The suit challenged the Georgia Department
of Health's prohibition on Medicaid reimbursement for such operations.
 
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Kentucky, another LSC grantee, represented
a lesbian mother who contested the custody of a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to the father, who had remarried.  In the case of <I>S.
v S.,</I>[9]  LSC lawyers challenged the customary preference for
the traditional family as the best environment in which to raise
children.
<P>
In a  1986 New York Case involving a lease agreement,[10] LSC claimed
that a &quot;gay life partner&quot; should be treated as a family
member.  Arguing that equal protection required that the gay partner
be treated as a family member, attorneys from the Legal Aid Society
successfully argued the case in the New York Supreme Court, calling
into question laws that favor and protect the traditional family.
  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PUSHING THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Children's rights,&quot; is another area where LSC lawyers
have pursued an anti-family agenda.  The notion that children
have rights independent of their parents is a concept that undermines
parental authority and opens the door to state interference in
the raising of children.  In the case of <I>Nafzinger v. Blum</I>,[11]
LSC lawyers successfully argued that minors who no longer wanted
to live at home should get their own welfare benefits.  The Legal
Aid Society of Central Texas, an LSC grant recipient, filed a
suit to force public housing officials to rent apartments to minors.[12]
 In 1992, Legal Services of Greater Miami argued that children
should have standing to sue their parents.[13] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>GOING SOFT ON CRIME AND AIDING CRIMINALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  In a bizarre and disturbing
case from Pennsylvania,  Lehigh Valley Legal Services represented
a convicted rapist in prison who was suing for custody of the
child he fathered by the rape of a 13 year old girl.  A psychologist
found the rapist unfit to be a parent and determined that any
child in his custody would be endangered.  After a three-day non-jury
trial the judge ruled that the rapist had no parental rights.[14]
 In cases like <I>Duran v. Elrod,</I>[15] LSC grantees have worked
hard to make sure that prisons look more like country clubs than
places to protect society from dangerous people. Such lawsuits
have had the additional consequence of increasing the costs of
incarcerating criminals, and putting many of them back on the
street, often in neighborhoods where the poor become their main
targets.[16]  LSC lawsuits have also made it difficult to evict drug
dealers from public housing units and to keep them out in the
first place.[17]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By advancing this radical, anti-family agenda, LSC has done far
more to hurt poor people than to help them.  The poor, as well
as the rest of the country, can't afford LSC.  In recent testimony
to a House Judiciary Sub-Committee Howard Phillips, former head
of the Office of Economic Opportunity,  said that the true cost
of LSC should include the impact of actual, threatened and feared
LSC-related suits as well as increased federal state and local
government spending.  According to Phillips, &quot;viewed in this
way, the LSC is properly seen as a central player in our current
national deficit and debt problem.&quot; [18] Attempts to reform LSC
have failed and the agency should be abolished.  The poor are
better served by state and local initiatives as well as private
foundations and bar associations.  These institutions have demonstrated
the ability to adequately meet the legitimate legal needs of the
poor.  Non-federal contributions to LSC-type programs amounted
to $255 million in 1994.[19]  At a time when Congress needs to carefully
assess budgetary priorities it makes no sense to continue funding
LSC.

<title>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE 
IN BEIJING</title>

<p>
<h2>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS<br>
TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE IN<br>
BEIJING</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The Family Research Council (FRC) is an organization dedicated
to preserving and strengthening the traditional family unit. 
As such, FRC is strongly opposed to major elements of the agenda
for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women which is to be held
in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995.
<P>
FRC finds this conference objectionable not only because the conference
-- which claims to uphold women's rights -- is being hosted by
a country with a long track record of abuses against women (i.e.,
female infanticide, coerced abortion policies, involuntary sterilization,
the one-child-per-couple mandate, etc.), but also because the
platform document under consideration denigrates motherhood, undermines
the traditional family unit, and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
Among its most egregious violations, the document:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrates the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  For example, the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed
throughout the entire platform so that it might be changed to
the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;  Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot;
has been bracketed so that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;
 [Bracketed sections indicate that delegates could not agree on
the text.  These sections are to be discussed further, with each
alternative weighed equally.]  In addition, the word &quot;family&quot;
almost always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation
to domestic violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fails to uphold traditional morality by leaving the term
&quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</B>
While &quot;gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform 
document, the U.N. fails to define the term.  During a preparatory
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  Only rarely does the document make mention of
the &quot;rights, duties, and responsibilities of parents,&quot;
but it seems to do so as a concession because parents are still
legally responsible for their children.  The document, however,
refuses to recognize parental <I>authority</I> in regards to their
children's reproductive health.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well-known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 While the platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands
and fathers, it does express the notion that women should be completely
autonomous in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the
platform urges governments to &quot;take action to ensure that
women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized and
respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems
to elevate reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights,
stating that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<title>CAPRICORN RECORDS GOES TO POT</title>

<h2>CAPRICORN RECORDS<br>
GOES TO POT</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>David J. Chamberlin and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Unfazed by the hit that Time Warner has received in the last two
months for peddling sex, drugs, and violence, Capricorn Records
will soon release <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit album with a portion
of the proceeds going to the National Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
<P>
It is not surprising that pro-drug musicians support NORML  --
 at least 45 bands have declared their support for legalizing
marijuana.[1]  It is surprising however, that Capricorn Records'
president Phil Walden didn't learn from Time Warner's recent public
flogging over the promoting of music that glorifies drug use,
puts down women, promotes Satanism, or encourages violence.
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recently emphasized
the dangers of marijuana, saying,  &quot;Young people must understand
that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous
drug that can have acute and hazardous effects. . .Drug use --
 including marijuana. . .is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.&quot;[2]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  Marijuana
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem solving, and forming concepts.[3]
<P>
More than 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana
damages brain cells and the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction
in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns
of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[4]
<P>
The effects of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those already
outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with crime.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent of inmates
have used cocaine and that half had used drugs in the month before
their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used marijuana
in the past.[5]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders, depression, and low self esteem.  A high proportion
of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.  
<UL>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana, killed
a stranger for no obvious reason.[6]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer, rum,
marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a tourist
from Brooklyn.[7]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother and
stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of marijuana.[8]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana when one
accidentally shot and killed the other.[9]</UL>
<P>
Not all users become violent, but social scientists confirm the
relationship between drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990
study published in the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found the
strongest association between the severity of the crime and the
type of substance abused  --  the more intoxicating the substance,
the more serious the incident.[10]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[11]
<P>
Fortunately, Walden still has time before <I>Hempilation's</I>
Sept. 26 release to reverse his blatant pro-drug decision.  Capricorn
ought to follow Simon &amp; Schuster's example of five years ago,
when it canceled plans to publish <I>American Psycho</I>, a novel
by Bret Easton Ellis, after advance complaints about objectionable
passages detailing the sexual torture and mutilation of women.[12]
<P>
It's time that record companies meet their responsibility to distribute
music that doesn't glorify drug use.  It's time Capricorn Records
heeded the timely warning that Time Warner received from angry
parents.

<title>CAREERS: A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAREERS:<br>
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
On Sept. 19, 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in
favor of the CAREERS Act (H.R. 2332), a bill which would consolidate
about 100 job training programs into three.  They call it a victory
because they've streamlined programs and saved money.  We call
it a failure to uproot key elements of the Goals 2000 agenda.
<p>
While sponsors of the bill accepted some of the changes suggested
by pro-family groups, they were unwilling to strike references
to the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) and a requirement
that state skill standards be referenced to the national skill
standards to be developed by that board.  NSSB was a creation
of the National Skill Standards Act of 1994, a part of the same
public law as Goals 2000 (Pub. Law 103-227), and in keeping with
its philosophy.  NSSB would fund, oversee, and endorse the creation
of a national system of skill standards, certificates, and assessments;
it is to occupational skills what the National Education Goals
Panel is to academics.  Yet some conservative members of Congress
failed to see the flaws in such a system.
<p>
One small victory was the addition of language to prohibit any
requirement that a student meet federally funded or endorsed skill
standards or obtain a federally funded or endorsed skill certificate.
 Because this provision has the potential to undermine significantly
the influence of the National Skill Standards Board, this provision
could be a prime target as the bill goes to conference.
<p>
CAREERS will now go to a House-Senate Conference Committee to
work out differences between versions passed in the two houses.
 Unfortunately,  Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan.) job training
bill (S. 143) embraces the philosophy advanced in the liberal
School-to-Work Act of 1994 even more than CAREERS does.  This
may threaten even the minor improvements gained in the House bill.
<p>
The 104th Congress has unfinished business in education.   No
adequate proposal to repeal Goals 2000 has yet been advanced.
 Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.) claims his &quot;Education Reform
Consolidation Grant&quot;  would repeal Goals 2000,  but it does
so only in name.   Its core elements remain intact:  the National
Education Goals Panel, the National Education Goals, and bullying
the states on how to reform.  Does it make sense for a &quot;reformist&quot;
Congress to pass on the meddlesome, bureaucratic, centralizing
legacy of Goals 2000 and School-to-Work, rather than put an end
to it?

<title>BIRTHS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN: HOW THE STATES ARE MEASURING UP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>BIRTHS TO<br>
UNMARRIED WOMEN:<br>
HOW THE STATES ARE<br>
MEASURING UP</h2></center>
<p>
Thirty-one percent of all births in the United States are to unmarried
women, according to a September 1995 report issued by the National
Center for Health Statistics.  Only 10 states have an illegitimacy
ratio below 25 percent.
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.  Indeed, among the southern rim states,
only Alabama and Texas have illegitimacy ratios lower than 35
percent.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a rate of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.
<p>
There is a strong relationship between the percentage of births
to unmarried women and race.  Nationally, 68.7 percent of all
black births are out of wedlock, while 23.6 percent of white births
are to unmarried women.  Thus, states with high percentages of
births out of wedlock also tend to have relatively high percentages
of unmarried black women.
<p>
Between the years of 1991-1993, the proportion of all births to
unmarried women rose 3 percentage points.  During this same time
period, non-marital childbearing rose for white women, declined
slightly for black women, and remained essentially unchanged for
Hispanic women. Individual state percentages declined in only two states 
from 1992 to 1993:  Michigan by 0.8 percent and Texas by 0.5 percent.
<p>
Of the nation's 20 most populous states, only Minnesota (with
a ratio of 23.4 percent) and Texas (with a ratio of 17.0 percent)
rank among the few Top Ten states with the lowest percentage of
births to unmarried women.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Definition:  Denial of AFDC cash benefits to women who
have additional children while on welfare.  The family cap passed
by the House includes a state option to provide vouchers for goods
and services in lieu of cash benefits.</b>
<p>
<li>The family cap represents a minimum standard of acceptability
for new welfare legislation.  Because being born out-of-wedlock
increases the likelihood that an individual will live in poverty,
depend on welfare -- and parent another child out-of-wedlock --
we cannot begin to address welfare dependency until we address
illegitimacy.
<p>
<li>The problem is NOT that too many women are on welfare.  The
problem is that too many single women are bearing children they
are neither financially nor emotionally prepared to support --
and welfare has almost certainly played a role in increasing that
trend.
<p>
<li>The family cap simply asks women on welfare to meet the same
social expectations and live by the same rules that the rest of
us do.  By insisting that women on welfare are every bit as capable
of personal responsibility and rational decision-making, the family
cap accords much more dignity to welfare mothers than the current
system.
<p>
<li>The family cap is a question of simple justice.  The working
poor certainly don't receive an increase in their salary when
they add children to their families.  And is it really fair to
children to encourage a generation of irresponsible parents by
dispensing checks willy-nilly?
<p>
<li>The family cap is a responsibility issue -- not a constriction
of reproductive freedom.  It is the current welfare system that
is manipulating fertility rates.  The fact that we are now confusing
an end to social engineering with social engineering itself is
simply evidence of how far wrong we've gone in the past 30 years.
<p>
<li>The argument is NOT that women have additional children in
order to get the additional dollars.  The existence of the welfare
system shields women from the natural economic consequences of
irresponsible decisions -- and thereby encourages a lack of parental
responsibility, which in turn harms marriage and hurts children.
<p>
<li>The preliminary results from New Jersey (the first state to
implement a family cap) are a powerful demonstration that the
family cap is an effective and necessary reform.  In an initial
experiment, the birth rate dropped for women in <I>both</I> the
treatment and control groups.  Meanwhile, there has been no real
increase in abortions -- the slight rise in the raw numbers is
well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  And in
fact, the pre-cap monthly average abortion rate is slightly <I>higher
</I>than the post-cap monthly average abortion rate.
<p>
<li>The fact that the birth rate dropped in both the treatment
and control groups suggests that the cap has sent a powerful symbolic
message about personal responsibility that has reinforced the
impact of erasing the economic incentive.  The evidence suggests,
then, that we must work to reform the culture at the same time
that we are reversing the perverse economic incentives of the
welfare system.  The goal, in other words, is to instill moral
knowledge while eliminating the tension between morality and the
incentives of the current welfare system.
<p>
<li>We hope to instill morality by rebuilding strong families
and by shifting functions from the state and federal governments
to character-forming institutions in the local community -- families,
schools, churches, and voluntary organizations.  Rebuilding strong
families will require a concerted effort to reduce illegitimacy,
and rebuilding the moral-cultural sphere will require scaling
back government benefits so that local communities are once again
free and able to care for their own.

<h2>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The institutionalization of &quot;family life&quot; or sex education
classes in public and private schools around the country has created
a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad
reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS has
left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no
alternative except to teach &quot;safe sex.&quot;  But there <I>is</I>
an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than &quot;safe
sex&quot; in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted
diseases -- abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned
school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</h3></center>
<p>
Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy
and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it is &quot;the most effective solution&quot; to unwanted pregnancy
and sexual disease.[1]
<p>
Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states -- including
Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana -- have
passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex
education programs be abstinence-based.[2] Many of these programs
have produced promising results:
<p><ul>
<li>San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted
an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled
<I>Sexuality, Commitment, and Family</I>.  The year before the
curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.
 But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became
pregnant.[3]
<p>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle
School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of
already pregnant girls. When the school decided to adopt an abstinence
program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three
years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <I>Project
Taking Charge</I>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes
in a row.[4]
<p>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of &quot;Best Friends,&quot;
only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program
began.  Elayne Bennett, director of &quot;Best Friends,&quot; says that 
between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common
for the same-sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the
District of Columbia.  One &quot;Best Friends&quot; member explains,
&quot;I want to save my virginity for the man I marry....And I
want my child to have a daddy.&quot;[5]
<p>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program <I>Sex Respect:
 The Option of True Sexual Freedom</I> found that students participating
in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those
in a comparison group.  Only 5 percent of the female program participants
and 9 percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the
two years following the program.[6]
<p>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <I>Postponing
Sexual Involvement</I>, teaches kids about abstinence through
skill-building exercises on &quot;how to say no.&quot;  An evaluation
of the program showed that its participants were less likely to
become sexually active than those not involved in the program.[7]
<p>
<li><I>AANCHOR</I>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility,
stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility
to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum
found three statistically significant differences between students
receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard
school curriculum. The students participating in AANCHOR were
significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths,
i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions
with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent
attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.[8]
<p>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <I>FACTS</I>
curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the
measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness,
and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These
attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.[9]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</h3></center>
<p>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents
and school board members should study curricula for their focus,
methodologies, and content.
<p>
<b>Focus of Curricula:</b> The growing interest in abstinence
curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves
as &quot;abstinence-based,&quot; &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; or
&quot;comprehensive&quot; because they mention abstinence as one
of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed
message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence
message.  Some common characteristics of these &quot;comprehensive&quot;
or &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; programs are that they (1) assume
that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception
and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting
abstinence as one of many options from which to choose).  Thus,
parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids
these danger points, and instead upholds abstinence as the way
to handle teen sex issues.
<p>
<b>Methodology of Curricula:</b> The method used to deliver sex
education material heavily influences the way students will respond
to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are
directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative
analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her
book <i>Foundations for Family Life Education</i>:[10]

</pre>
<p><hr><p>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values
and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education
study, &quot;The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing
Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing,&quot; which found that &quot;adolescents
with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher
educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and
have higher educational expectations for their daughters have
lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth.&quot;[11]
<p>
Furthermore, students want help in saying &quot;no&quot; to sexual
activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active
girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce
teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, &quot;How to say no without
hurting the other person's feelings.&quot;[12]  Moreover, a recent
study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sex Information
and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that,
of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have
waited until they were older.[13]
<p>
<b>Content of Curricula:</b> Sex education curricula vary greatly
by content, and parents should be particularly concerned if the
curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the
intended audience.  Caution is recommended even in cases in which
a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed
by prominent organizations.  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA)
endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and
homosexuality.[14]
<p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the
United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals
for sex education curricula entitled, &quot;<U>Guidelines for
Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</U>&quot;.
 The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together,
and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.[15]

<title>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY<br>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
The entire spectrum of pornographic material is available on computer
networks including images of soft-core nudity, hard-core sex acts,
anal sex, bestiality, bondage &amp; dominion, sado-masochism (including
actual torture and mutilation, usually of women, for sexual pleasure),
scatological acts (defecating and urinating, usually on women,
for sexual pleasure), fetishes, and child pornography.  Additionally,
there is textual pornography including detailed text stories of
the rape, mutilation, and torture of women, sexual abuse of children,
graphic incest, etc.
<p>
<center><h4>WHO CAN ACCESS PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Virtually anyone with an account or access to the Internet can
access pornography.  Once &quot;on-line&quot; there are no truly
effective safety measures to prevent children from accessing all
of the pornography described above.  This unlimited access to
pornography, with no accurate, enforceable age check and no verification
procedures, has never occurred in the print, broadcast, satellite
or cable media before.  Cyberspace is currently the free speech
absolutist's dream world.
<p>
<center><h4>WHERE DO CHILDREN AND ADULTS FIND PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Pornography is publicly available through the Internet by accessing
sections in the hierarchies of the Usenet and at a number of sites
on the World-Wide-Web.  It is also traded daily via Internet e-mail
and sites set up for the exchange of pornography.
<p>
<center><h4>ARE THESE SITES POPULAR OR IS THIS REALLY A SMALL PROBLEM?</h4>
</center>
<p>
Although surveys done by on-line administrators indicate that
pornographic sites are among the most often used on the Internet,
the relative percentage of pornographic sites is not certain.
 Regardless of the actual number of sites, which is on the rise, the 
problem of pornography continues to be a very serious one.  Like drugs, 
pornography's destructive effects are felt far beyond the &quot;pusher&quot;
and &quot;user.&quot;
<p>
<center><h4>DON'T WE NEED FURTHER STUDY BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON AN ISSUE 
THAT AFFECTS THE FUTURE OF CYBERSPACE?</h4></center>
<p>
Proposals to &quot;study&quot; the issue of computer pornography
are attempts by the ACLU and other ideological groups to delay legislative 
action on this problem.  They fight virtually any legislative restriction on
materials distributed on-line,  and want to dump all responsibility
for action into the laps of parents, many of whom are far less
technologically capable than their children.
<p>
<center><h4>ISN'T THE ON-LINE COMMUNITY AGAINST PROPOSALS FOR &QUOT;DECENCY&QUOT;
ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Some of the on-line community and many of the media are opposed
to any proposals to regulate the Internet or children's access
to pornography.  However, out of an estimated 20 million predominately
male users of various on-line networks, fewer than 2 percent have
opposed the proposals.
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSCENITY AND INDECENCY?</h4>
</center>
<p>
<I>Obscenity</I> is hard-core sexual material so graphic and unredeeming
that it meets the Supreme Court's three-part test: (1) it appeals
to an abnormal or excessive interest in sex; (2) it depicts or
describes sexually explicit conduct in a patently offensive way;
and (3) it lacks serious literary artistic, political, or scientific
value. <i>Miller v. California</i> (1973). <I>Indecency</I> is
a pattern of patently offensive depictions or descriptions of
sexual or excretory activities or organs.  <i>Pacifica v. F.C.C.</i>
(1978).  This material is legal for consenting adults, but can
be regulated so that it is kept from children.
<p>
<center><h4>WON'T THE BANNING OF &QUOT;INDECENT&QUOT; MATERIALS JEOPARDIZE
SERIOUS WORKS OF LITERATURE OR LIBRARY ART?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  This argument is no more credible now than it was when used
against indecency laws in other contexts.  No serious literary
or artistic works would be banned by an indecency law.  Society
has long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful
material have the obligation to keep the material from children.
 Computer indecency should be no exception.
<p>
<center><h4>AREN'T THERE &QUOT;TECHNICAL FIXES&QUOT; THAT ARE LESS INTRUSIVE
THAN A REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL LAW APPROACH?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  To date, only a few software programs have been released
to regulate children's access to pornography, such as SurfWatch
and NetNanny.  Also, these programs can be bypassed by users with
a good knowledge of the Internet and some technical sophistication.
 Even if better technical solutions become available, this approach
is inadequate in and of itself because:
<ul>
<li>children can walk down the street to another computer
<li>parents' technical ability often pales in comparison to their
children's expertise
<li>pornographers aren't legally discouraged from peddling their
materials to children
</ul>
<p>
<I>The above material includes excerpts adapted from &quot;Children,
Pornography and Cyberspace: The Problem, Solutions &amp; the Current
Congressional Debate&quot; published by the National Coalition
for the Protection of Children &amp; Families.</I>

<h2>STATE-BY-STATE<br>
DIVORCE RATES:<br>
MASSACHUSETTS LOWEST;<br>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank first and second, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation, according to
new 1994 divorce data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Both states experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between
1992 and 1994 to remain at the top of the list. Massachusetts
fell from 2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from
3.1 to 2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period. Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to 9.0
in 1994.
<p>
The divorce rate per 1,000 population for the entire United States
was 4.6 in 1994, down from 4.8 in 1992. Generally, rates were
lower in the Northeast and Midwest and higher in the West and
Southeast.
<p>
Only four states (New York, South Dakota, Missouri, and Mississippi)
experienced a rise in divorce rates between 1992 and 1994. Eight
other states held the same rate during 1992 and 1994. Vermont,
with a drop in the divorce rate from 5.2 to 4.0, rose in rank
from 27th to a tie for 15th position.

<title>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Remove all the frills and Goals 2000 is essentially an application
process.  These are the terms:  a state agrees to report to the
federal government on its standards and assessments in exchange
for federal grant money.  Signing on the dotted line means a state
will submit its plan for improvement -- standards, assessments
and all -- for federal critique.  There are strings attached to
the Goals 2000 money, and they cannot be avoided unless a state
refuses to participate.
<p>
The only way Goals 2000 can rightly be termed &quot;voluntary&quot;
is that states currently have the option not to participate in
the program.  However, the Goals 2000 application process can
be attached to any piece of federal legislation.  As its requirements
are added to more and more legislation, there will be no way for
states to get federal money for education without submitting to
Goals 2000.
<p>
What's wrong with the terms of the Goals 2000 application agreement?
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  American tradition and law have held that
education is a matter of state and local concern.  As the federal
government began to usurp the control of education, curriculum
was still set apart as an issue reserved for state and local decisionmakers.
The U.S. Education Department was specifically prohibited from
dealing with curricular issues when it was created in 1980.  Yet
Goals 2000 ignores the prohibition.  It calls for federal involvement
in the funding, development and approval of standards and assessments.
These are curricular issues in which the federal government should
not be involved.  Thus, the Goals 2000 application requires a
state to submit to an inappropriate role for the federal government.

<title>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Goals 2000 proponents are conceding flaws in their prized program.
President Bill Clinton himself recently confided to writer Ben
Wattenberg that his education program wasn't what he had hoped
it would be.
<p>
Nevertheless, Goals 2000 spin doctors are now suggesting that,
with the right makeover, the program will emerge irresistible
even to those who previously spurned it.  So they're willing to
undergo an utterly painless procedure:  removal of two controversial
surface elements of Goals 2000 -- the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), and opportunity-to-learn standards.
<p>
<h4>Leaders in the U.S. Congress, governors' offices and state
legislatures should understand that lifts and tucks aren't enough.
The core elements of Goals 2000 are unacceptable:</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>National Education Goals written as federal law (Public Law
103-227); 
<li>a federally funded National Education Goals Panel;
<li>a federally funded National Education Standards and Improvement
Council (NESIC);
<li>a new formula for reform:  federally funded standards and
assessments; and
<li>a prescription that states use this formula for reform and
submit their standards and assessments to the federal government
for approval.
</ul><p>
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  When the U.S. Education Department was
created back in 1979, it was prohibited from dealing with curricular
issues.  Standards and assessments are curricular matters, and
the federal government has no business formulating or reviewing
them.
<p>
<h4>New Twist:  A Dangerous Liaison</h4>
<p>
Some officials, however, have no problem with federal review of
state plans -- in fact, they extend the offer to local districts
as well.  They propose that the federal government disregard the
authority of states like Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana and
Alabama, which have chosen not to participate in Goals 2000, and
go straight to the local districts interested in making a few
bucks by hitching up with Goals 2000.  What better way to invite
federal intrusion into local schools than to have local districts
bypass state authority and submit their plans directly to the
federal government for approval?
<p>
Goals 2000 is built on the flawed thesis that a greater federal
role in the education system will improve schools.  It hasn't
and it won't.  The program and the systems it spawned should be
discontinued immediately.  The money freed up will be spent more
effectively on real education needs -- not systems management
-- if left in the hands of parents and teachers closest to the
student.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the Families
and Work Institute and the Whirlpool Foundation indicates that
56 percent of all women want more flexibility in their job structures
and work hours without losing their benefits. Similarly, about
one-third of women would work part-time if they could afford to
do so.[1]

<p>

<li>According to this same poll, more than one-fourth of all women
cited the lack of family time as their greatest concern, surpassing
even concerns about neighborhood crime and safety.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1994 University of Connecticut-Storrs study of young mothers
found widespread &quot;ambivalence about returning to work&quot;
and a widespread concern about &quot;loss of time and experience
with their infants.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>A 1995 poll entitled &quot;Women: The New Providers&quot;
found that 88 percent of women say they are pressed for time and
that their greatest concern is not having enough time together
as a family.[4]

<p>

<li>This same poll found that if money were not a consideration,
33 percent would like to work part time, 31 percent would choose
to work at home caring for the family, 20 percent would select
volunteer work while only 15 percent would choose to work full
time.[5]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, according to the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I>.[6]

<p>

<li>A 1992 <I>ABC News</I> poll found that while 59 percent of
adult women nationally believe that &quot;the changes in American
life caused by more women working outside the home have been worth
making,&quot; but 58 percent sometimes long for the days in which
women didn't work outside the home.[7]

<p>

<li>Women who work are &quot;spending less time being married
and having children,&quot; according to researcher John Robinson,
in order to cope with the time constraints created by employment.[8]

<p>

<li>In 1994, 41.6 percent of all women were not in the labor force.
Thirty-nine percent of all women were employed full-time.[9]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT PARENTS WANT</title>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT PARENTS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 Families and Work Institute study found that 66 percent
of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide wanted more time with
their children.[1]

<p>

<li>Parents today spend only 17 hours per week with their children,
40 percent less than in 1965, according to a University of Maryland
study.[2]

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[3]

<p>

<li>Sixty-six percent of employed parents with children ages 18
and under indicated that they did not have enough time with their
children, and another 50 percent indicated that they did not have
enough time with their spouses.[4]

<p>

<li>Thirty-five percent of all workers with children would be
willing to change jobs in order to receive flexible scheduling
around their home concerns.[5]

<p>

<li>The 44 percent of parents who do not feel that they spend
enough time with their children cite work as the most frequent
culprit.[6]

<p>

<li>Half of America's moms have said no to job advancement compared
with only 29 percent of dads. This trend is more prevalent in
younger mothers, where 62 percent have turned down promotions
in favor of spending more time with their children. However, two
out of three dads say they have not turned down a job promotion
in favor of spending more time with their kids.[7]

<p>

<li>Half of all fathers feel that they do not spend enough time
with their children.[8]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Gallup poll found that nearly half of all parents feel
that they spend too little time with their children. Fewer than
one-third of these respondents ate dinner together on a regular
basis.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents' top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking 
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot; 
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by 1986 
parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with their 
children then they did in 1960.[10]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT AMERICANS WANT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT AMERICANS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 study conducted by the Families and Work Institute
found that 66 percent of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide
wanted more time with their children.[1]

<p>

<li>&quot;The Changing Workforce,&quot; a national study conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, found that 66 percent of employed
parents with children ages 18 and under indicated that they did
not have enough time with their children, and another 50 percent
indicated that they did not have enough time with their spouses.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1991 Gallup poll found that when asked what was most important
to them, Americans ranked family life and betterment of society
above &quot;having a nice home, car, and other belongings.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>On average, parents today spend only 17 hours per week with
their children, according to a University of Maryland study.[4] This
is roughly 40 percent less than in 1965.

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[5]

<p>

<li>Sixty percent of all employees consider their jobs effect
on their personal or family life to be a &quot;very important&quot;
factor in their decision to take the job. This is not surprising,
as 42 percent of all U.S. workers have children under 18 years
of age living at home. Furthermore, 32 percent of all U.S. workers
have children under 13 years of age at home, and in 66 percent
of these families both parents work (18 percent for kids under
6 years of age).[6]

<p>

<li>According to a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Company, half of all fathers feel that they do
not spend enough time with their children.[7]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, while 48 percent of men would prefer
more time than money.[8]

<p>

<li>Most workers (57 percent) would trade early retirement in
favor of family time, according to a survey commissioned by the
Family Research Council. Roughly a third (36 percent) said they
prefer to work longer hours now and retire sooner.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot;
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by
1986 parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with
their children than they did in 1960.[10]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Wharton School study found that people who placed high
importance on finding the right spouse and creating a good family
life actually ended up earning more money than those who were
willing to sacrifice home life for their careers. Peter Capelli,
a management professor at the Wharton School, explains that building
a good family life is particularly important early in careers
as &quot;that's where the serious mistakes get made. People who
didn't take time for their families spend a lot of time putting
Band-Aids on family problems&quot; later on, which hurts work
performance and commitment.[11]

<p>

<li>Seventy-eight percent of Americans feel that a father should
choose to spend more time with his children if given the choice
between that and earning more money for his family, and 75 percent
felt that a mother should choose to spend more time with her children
if given the same choice.[12]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT CHILDREN WANT</title>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT CHILDREN WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Half of all children watch more than two hours of television
a day, but three-fourths of these children say that if they could
choose between spending time with their families and watching
television they would choose family time.[1]

<p>

<li>Among children ages 8 to 12, 31 percent say that they do not
spend enough time with their fathers.[2]

<p>

<li>On any given day, nearly 400,000 children -- none of them
eligible for adoption -- can be found in government foster homes,
group homes, and shelters.[3] As one child says, &quot;I'm all 
wrapped up in programs....What I need is a mom.&quot;

<p>

<li>According to the American Public Welfare Association, the
population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the U.S. child population in general. During each
of the past 10 years, more children have entered the system than
exited.[4]

<p>

<li>Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from foster
care by turning 18 with no permanent family. Forty percent of
all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.[5]

<p>

<li>Judith S. Wallerstein conducted a study of 60 families who
experienced divorce between 1971 and 1981. Ten years after the
divorce, the children affected felt &quot;less protected, less
cared for, less comforted...these children [had] vivid, gut-wrenching
memories of their parents' separation.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In the same study by Wallerstein, many 5- to 8-year-old boys
showed &quot;an intense longing for their fathers&quot; after
the divorce -- a longing that seemed physically painful.<B> </B>Not
only did the children's need for their father continue, but it
also tended to recur with new intensity at adolescence, especially
when it was time for the children to leave home.[7]

<p>

<li>Almost 20 percent of sixth- through 12th-graders have not
had a good conversation lasting for at least 10 minutes with at
least one of their parents in more than a month.[8]

<p>

<li>More than one-half of all children who don't live with their
father have never been in their father's current home.[9]

<p>

<li>&quot;Father hunger&quot; often afflicts boys age one and
two whose fathers are suddenly and permanently absent. Sleep disturbances,
such as trouble falling asleep, nightmares, and night terrors
frequently begin within one to three months after the father leaves
home.[10]

<p>

<li>The National Commission on Children reported that children
from step-families were more likely to say they often felt lonely
or blue than children from either single-parent or intact families.[11]

<TITLE>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<P>
<H2>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:<BR>
TWO SIDES OF A SINGLE COIN </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Republicans in Congress have a vested interest in precluding further
debate about the impact of the family cap on marginal abortion
rates.  A united front will send a stronger message to the states
that the welfare system must be radically changed and, at the
same time, will suggest more powerfully than words that neither
politicians nor the party need be hamstrung by an unequivocal
commitment to life.
<P>
By offering cash bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock
births <U>and</U> abortions, the House Ways and Means committee
has seized upon an ideal opportunity to showcase pro-life consensus
-- without muting the emphasis on illegitimacy.
<P>
The incentives measure explicitly avoids reducing illegitimate
births by increasing abortions because changes in the amount of
the grant depend upon a ratio that defines <U>both</U> illegitimate
births and abortions as negative outcomes.  The current bill defines
the &quot;negative outcome ratio&quot; as the total number of
out-of-wedlock births plus abortions, divided by the total number
of births in the state in the applicable year.
<P>
 
By including abortions and out-of-wedlock births in the same total,
the measure eliminates all incentive for states to promote abortion
-- instead of abstinence and marriage -- as the means to ensure
that fewer children are born out of wedlock.  In fact, if passed,
the measure would represent the first time the federal government
has actually rewarded states for implementing policies that contribute
to a lower abortion rate.
<P>
At the same time, the incentives provision strengthens the anti-illegitimacy
provisions in the Republican bill.  The subcommittee bill, for
example, targeted only welfare mothers under the age of 18; but
the new language encourages states to reduce the illegitimacy
rate in all age groups.
<P>
One of the greatest appeals of an incentives solution is that
it explodes the myth that reducing illegitimacy and eliminating
abortion are mutually exclusive goals -- a pernicious misconception
that has been manufactured by liberal observers with a vested
interest in dividing conservative support for welfare reform.

<P>
Pro-lifers should combat that perception at all costs, short of
compromising our principles.  What we think about the right to
life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of
society we should institute -- and spiraling illegitimacy rates
erode our national character in ways that inevitably warp our
vision of the good society.
<P>
While we know that abortion is not an acceptable means to reduce
illegitimacy, we do not know which strategy will work best to
stem the tide of family breakdown.  James Q. Wilson argues that
&quot;the federal government cannot have a meaningful family policy
for the nation, and it ought not to try.&quot;  Codifying that
admonition, the new amendment guarantees the maximum amount of
flexibility that is consistent with a rigorous emphasis on the
reduction of illegitimacy -- and with an insistence on state accountability
for the use of federal funds.
<P>
One caveat Professor Wilson cites (and Speaker Gingrich has reiterated)
is that &quot;every major new [state] initiative must be evaluated
by independent observers operating in accordance with accepted
scientific canons.&quot;  By linking the funding mechanism to
changes in the negative outcomes ratio, the incentives provision
guarantees that states will generate objective data regarding
the number of non-marital births and abortions each fiscal year
-- and that policymakers can assess the &quot;success&quot; of
state experimentation accordingly.  By measuring &quot;outputs&quot;
independently of the dollar inputs which produce them, the amendment
ameliorates one of the worst non-market failures of the current
system.
<P>
By contrast, block grants without any semblance of accountability
threaten to turn the governors into the country's 50 biggest welfare
clients.  Lacking profit as a measure of performance, a state
welfare agency would view its budget as the proxy goal to be maximized.
 In studying the Reagan-era strategy of devolution-by-block-grant,
liberal analysts Richard Nathan and Fred Doolittle discovered
what they termed &quot;the paradox of devolution&quot;:  devolutionary
initiatives activated state and local governments to increase
their own support for programs cut at the federal level -- and,
in turn, to lobby heavily for the restoration of cuts and creeping
increases in grants.  In the end, the Reagan block grants failed
to reverse the growth of government at any level.
<P>
Nathan and Doolittle conclude: &quot;Our advice to politicians
would be for liberals to support state role enhancement in policymaking
and administration in conservative periods.&quot;  The advice
should give conservatives pause before they promote schemes that
give unfettered latitude to the states without also eliminating
all federal funding.
<P>
Short of radical devolution, the best alternative is a measure
that will turn the current incentives structure on its head. 
By rerouting federal dollars to reward the reduction of illegitimacy
rather than the expansion of bureaucracy, an incentives amendment
models a useful mechanism for revising federal-state relations
as well as accomplishing other worthwhile policy goals.

<H2>FREE SPEECH DROWNS<BR>
IN THE WAKE OF THE PC NAVY </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has become so politically correct (PC) since the Tailhook
debacle that now sailors can't even express their opinion about
a controversial policy.
<P>
Last August, Navy pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth Carkhuff told his boss
that he objected to women serving in combat and that his views
were based on religious convictions. As a result, Carkhuff was
removed from his unit and now faces dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate
leadership.&quot;
<P>
Since when does expressing an opinion translate into a leadership
failure? According to the Navy, Carkhuff's disagreement with its
full-steam-ahead women in combat policy warrants a discharge without
benefits after 13 years of outstanding service.
<P>
Carkhuff believes that women should not be subjected to the violence
of combat. His religiously-motivated beliefs are shared by many
less vocal members of the military who understand that PC reigns
and stating a contrary belief is grounds for dismissal.
<P>
This case is really about Constitutionally guaranteed free speech.
During the Second World War the Supreme Court heard a case involving
religiously based speech. In <I>Barnette v. West Virginia State
Board of Education</I>, the high court found that education authorities
could not force a Jehovah's Witness to pledge allegiance to the
American flag. The court ruled that, &quot;Freedom to differ is
not limited to things that do not matter.&quot;
<P>
Women in combat matters to Cmdr. Carkhuff because it's contrary
to his religious beliefs. The 34-year-old Naval Academy graduate
does not dispute the Navy's authority to place women in combat,
but he respectfully disagrees and exercised his Constitutional
right to express that opinion privately.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women. Today, women can serve in 95 percent of
all Navy billets. Feminists say this is progress, but combat veterans
and our combat-hardened allies know this portends future disaster.
<P>
In 1992, uniformed female military officers descended on Capitol
Hill to lobby against the female combat ban labeling it an &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; issue. The

Pentagon ignored the regulations which restrict uniformed sailors
from lobbying.
<P>
These women won their fight. But in contrast, when a lone man
objects to the same radical changes, suddenly an anchor from Washington
drops on his berth threatening to sink him along with his wife
and five children.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff was assigned to an SH60B Seahawk unit which had
five pilots; two were female. He disagreed with the Navy's women-in-combat
policy but agreed to fly with female pilots if ordered. His boss
chose the PC route and booted Carkhuff overboard.
<P>
On January 25th, the Chief of Naval Personnel sent Carkhuff a
letter charging him with &quot;substandard performance&quot; and
failure to demonstrate leadership for not supporting the Navy's
female policy. A board of three Naval captains will soon determine
his fate.
<P>
The issue for Congress is whether the Navy has so embraced political
correctness that it no longer stands by objective truth. Sample
evidence of the Navy's ongoing PC revolution.
<UL>
<LI>Top admiral Jeremy Boorda made one of his first visits to Capitol
Hill a session with Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.) -- Tailhook's
grand inquisitor -- and promised to do better. He now oversees
the rapid feminization of the Navy.
<P>
<LI>Three top admirals -- Kelso, Arthur and Mauz -- suffered direct
hits from unsubstantiated feminist accusations. These wounded
warriors were put to sea by the PC Navy.
<P>
<LI> The Navy deceived the public about the pregnancy problem aboard
the first aircraft carrier with women. Five pregnancies became
29 and the count is still climbing.
<P>
<LI>The Navy wrote a pregnancy policy that all but endorses abortion
and takes no position on out-of-wedlock births much less pregnancies
that result from extramarital affairs. But two-thirds of all uniformed,
one-time mothers have never been married and more than half of
all pregnant women who abandon ship never return.
<P>
<LI>The Navy hosted &quot;Diversity Day '94&quot; last September
which was attended by six PC admirals and included seminars that
promoted homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>

The Clinton Administration's decision to place more women in combat

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;  He also conceded
that &quot;there's no question that ending welfare for unwed mothers
would work.  The question is `Is it morally right?'&quot;
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for far more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood that the
way to reintegrate the deviant into society is to cultivate in
them the values of the mainstream culture.
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart 
virtues that temper and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms
must give way.  So, too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders
understood it.  Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said,
is the only true basis of equality and 

the only requisite for citizenship.  Either we act now to reduce
illegitimacy and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment
to higher and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  Given the
consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community,
and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without
a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be regarded as a
morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is
also wrong to sanction such activity by subsidizing it.  Himmelfarb
writes that &quot;after making the most arduous attempt to objectify
the problem of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions
and conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and
material dimensions of that problem are.&quot;
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  &quot;Welfare programs,&quot; he said, &quot;must
contribute to the attack on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy.
. . .  Unless such problems are dealt with effectively, they fester,
and grow, sapping the strength of society as a whole and extending
their consequences in troubled families from one generation to
the next.&quot;  Kennedy's insight about the consequences has
proven historically accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach
to curbing illegitimacy worked no better than the current President's
will.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, an unnamed aide on the
Clinton welfare task force confided to <U>Newsweek</U> reporter
Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around
the country that were trying to deal with this problem, and not
one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
 A formal study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored
by the Department of Health and Human Services in response to
&quot;persistently high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot;
found that &quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing
pattern of impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite
. . . the substantial efforts of the programs to empower [the]
young mothers to take control of their fertility.&quot;
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <U>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</U>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young
women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect
of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately,
tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else.&quot;  Eliminating
grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient,
to restore the integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers - of any age -
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
As the one policy option that promises to effect change in the
current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.  If compassion is once again properly
understood, perhaps then it will become more obvious that the
object of our concern must be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot;
not economic poverty, and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident
today is the spiritual and moral deprivation visited upon dependents
of the welfare system.  It is time that we stop suppressing the
moral responsibilities that make life precious for a resident
of the inner city just the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.
 It is time, in short, to secure equal access to the central satisfactions
of family, virtue, and freedom.

<P>
<H2>A PRO-LIFE DEFENSE<BR>
  OF THE FAMILY CAP</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both the concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.
<P>
All right-to-life activists should realize that, as one of the
few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy arsenal, the family cap not
only serves their cause in the long-term but deserves their active
support in the present debate -- subject to the critical qualification
that there must be no attendant funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data is available to demonstrate that the family cap stimulates
the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that the family
cap will <U>not</U> increase abortions, even in the short-term.
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.
<P>
Policy data collected by the Family Research Council suggests
that abortion is even less acceptable to poor women; and an article
recently published in <U>Family Planning Perspectives</U> found
that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U>
than national averages for all teenage girls.
<P>
Other research suggests that, whether conception was intended
or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women today are
&quot;wanted.&quot;  Certainly, there is 

anecdotal evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because
they want &quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because
their peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.
<P>
Others simply believe that abortion is wrong and choose not to
compound their first mistake by committing another.  While poverty
dispirits some lives, in others it serves to highlight the intangibles
that make life most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration
among the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every
person, regardless of economic status, is capable of the very
moral commitments that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap is the number of
lives saved in the short-term.  The question itself is a red herring
because it obscures the larger and more important issue: &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Liberal observers with a vested interest in dividing conservative
support have manufactured a pernicious myth that reducing illegitimacy
and eliminating abortion are mutually exclusive goals.  Pro-lifers
should combat that perception at all costs, short of suspending
our principles, because there is no question that reducing illegitimacy
by reducing the federal subsidy will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women who are
pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local organizations,
including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups, that will counsel
against abortion and discourage further irresponsible behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
<P>
Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
We should bear in mind that what we think about the right to life
has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of society
we should institute.  Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks
of &quot;life&quot; in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; -- two conditions that
speak directly to the question of how best to organize society.
<P>
By opposing the current system of welfare benefits, we advocate
a transformation of the political and social culture that will
sustain both &quot;happiness&quot; and a more enduring pro-life
consensus than even legal reform can hope to accomplish.

<P>
<H2> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES<BR>
 TAXPAYER MONEY TO PROMOTE<BR>
 FEMINIST AGENDA</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
The federal government used taxpayer money to buy packets of radical
feminist literature that denigrates men, promotes abortion on
demand, and declares homosexuality to be the moral equivalent
of heterosexuality.
<P>
The Postal Service and the United States Information Agency have
purchased these packets from the feminist Ms. Foundation for Women
and distributed them nationwide.  The materials were designed
to help plan the annual &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day,&quot;
which occurred Thursday, April 27th.  
<P>
The Ms. material:
<P>
<LI> Demonizes men and makes girls appear to be uniformly victimized
in a patriarchal society.
<P>
<LI> Presents an unbalanced analysis of educational opportunities
for the sexes.
<P>
<LI>Promotes abortion and warns that unnamed factions want to take
away the &quot;right to choose.&quot;
<P>
<LI> Severely exaggerates statistics.
<P>
The 136-page packets include parent, employer and school guides;
lesson plans for girls and boys; a synopsis of gender bias research;
and merchandise and literature order forms.  
<P>
The Ms. Foundation claims responsibility for creating and sponsoring
&quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&quot; as a public-education
campaign about girls and self-esteem.  According to its mission
statement, the Ms. Foundation &quot;directs resources to break
down barriers based on ...sexual orientation...[and promotes]
reproductive rights.&quot;  &quot;Sexual orientation&quot; is
code for homosexuality.
<P>
The packets include books such as <U><I>Medicine Women</I></U>,
for girls age 13 and up, which teaches about women who were midwives,
witches, high priestesses, female warriors and more.  Another
book, <U><I>Reinventing the Family: the Emerging Story of Lesbian
and Gay Parents</I></U> &quot;dramatize[s] the ingrained antipathy
of the larger society toward homosexuals [and] refute[s] the
detrimental assumptions hampering wider acceptance of gay parenting.&quot;

<P>
The packet further profiles facts about &quot;male dominance,&quot;
e.g., &quot;Between 1980 and 1990, the number of senior girls
in high school interested in engineering dropped by 25%.  Nationally,
the number of college women going into science and graduating
in science is declining.  Women and girls continue to be enrolled
in education and training programs that prepare them for low-wage
jobs in traditionally female occupations.&quot;
<P>
The materials often lack balance.  For example,  no mention is
made that more bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded to
women; boys get better scores in math and science, but girls get
higher scores in reading and writing; boys in eighth grade are
50 percent more likely to be held back a grade; and boys in high
school constitute 68 percent of the &quot;special education&quot;
population.
<P>
Feminist heroines like professor Anita Hill, Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger and activist Gloria Steinem are highlighted,
as are events like the Supreme Court decision, <I>Roe v. Wade</I>,
which legalized abortion.
<P>
Anita Hill is accorded &quot;victim&quot; status in the Clarence
Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearing because she testified
&quot;before an all-male, all-white Senate judiciary committee.&quot;
<P>
Ms. Founder Gloria Steinem is credited with the statement: &quot;A
woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.&quot;  What
does this have to do with the self-esteem of little girls?
<P>
The pro-abortion message is clear.  Under the name of Margaret
Sanger the material reads: &quot;Still, in the 90s, 40,000 teenage
girls drop out of school each year because of pregnancy.&quot;
 Next to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>: an &quot;estimated 1.2 million additional
unintended pregnancies would occur each year in absence of publicly
funded women's health services.&quot;
<P>
The material also includes the statement: &quot;10% of American
women are lesbians and approximately 3.5 million lesbian and gay
Americans have had children.&quot;  The 10% figure is based on
Alfred Kinsey's thoroughly discredited estimate of the incidence
of homosexuality in the population.  Kinsey, an Indiana University
zoologist who authored <U><I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I></U>
in 1948, based his research on 12,000 interviews, relying heavily
on data gleaned from criminals.  He extrapolated his findings
to the general population.  A number of recent studies have found
the population indulging in homosexual behavior to be considerably
less than 10 percent, and probably no more than 1 to 2 percent.
 
<P>
In a blatant attempt to redefine the family, the material lists
an unknown court case that declared &quot;[t]wo women make up
a `family of affinity.'&quot;  Also, the wildly exaggerated estimate
that 3.5 million children are being raised in homosexual homes
has no foundation in fact.
<P>
On another &quot;hot&quot; feminist issue, the Ms. Foundation
claims that &quot;Every 15 seconds in the U.S. a woman is battered.
 It is the greatest single cause of injury to women, more than
car accidents, muggings and rapes combined.&quot;  This, too,
is an exaggeration.
<P>
There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year.  If an American woman
is battered every 15 seconds then there are 2,124,000 such incidents.
 According to the Justice Department there are only 133,228 single-offender
assaults each year attributed to an offending spouse.  That's
one every 237 seconds.  
<P>
The Justice Department's 1994 report, &quot;Violence Against Women,&quot;
found that women are almost twice as likely to be victimized by
a boyfriend or ex-spouse than by a current spouse.  It projects
each year that there are 367,462 assaults by boyfriends or ex-spouses
compared to 195,980 by spouses.  And women are more likely to
be assaulted by a friend than by an intimate or relative.
<P>
Although the Ms. Foundation claims that &quot;girls are 4 to 5
times more likely to attempt suicide,&quot;  it neglects to mention
that boys actually kill themselves at a rate six times that of
girls.
<P>
The Census Bureau found that for all Americans 15 to 24 years
old in 1991, 11.8 percent of boys and 9.8 percent of girls used
cigarettes.  But Ms. says, &quot;Girls smoke more than boys.&quot;
<P>
While the feminist organization claims that girls are neglected
in classrooms, the fact is that most of the attention boys receive
is disciplinary.  Factoring-out conduct-related exchanges makes
the numbers similar.
<P>
The Ms. Foundation is a highly partisan political advocacy organization
which relies on unvetted research.  Ms. literature routinely has
promoted division between the sexes and has denigrated women who
do not work outside the home.  The federal government should not
embrace -- and thereby endorse -- materials which are anti-male,
pro-abortion, and pro-homosexual.

 PERSPECTIVE<BR>
  ON PROMISE KEEPERS</H2>

<P>
Thirteen &quot;Promise Keepers&quot; events will be held across
the nation this summer, equipping and encouraging an estimated
half-million men to keep their promises to God, to their wives
and children, and to their fellow man.  While this laudable movement
to honor one's word is not aimed at a particular age group, some
might believe its &quot;traditional values&quot; message would
have more appeal among older generations.  Perhaps.  But public
opinion data indicate that one age group which might be especially
receptive to this message are young adults -- the so-called &quot;Generation
X.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Generation Xers (adults aged 18-29) are more likely than
any other adult age group to say that &quot;divorce should be
harder [rather than easier] to obtain,&quot; according to a recent
compilation of public opinion polls by the American Enterprise
Institute.
<P>
This finding is significant because it deviates from previous
generational trends.  Those in the younger age ranges have typically
held more liberal views toward divorce than their elders.  For
example, Baby Boomers (those between age 30 and 48 today) said
20 years ago that divorce should be easier to obtain -- a view
to which fewer of their elders subscribed.
<P>
Why, then, would Generation X be <I>more</I> likely than their
elders to hold traditional values on the permanence of marriage?
 The reasons are admittedly complex.
<P>
Some attempt to explain this anomaly by remarking that Gen Xers
are too young to understand the difficulties of marriage, and
that once Gen Xers are exposed to the hardships of married life,
their attitudes toward liberalized divorce policies would also
change.
<P>
But a more compelling reason -- the one on which most people agree
-- is that far from being ignorant about the hardships of marriage,
Gen Xers personally understand the devastating effects of <I><B>divorce</B></I>.
<P>
Indeed, Generation Xers are more likely than any other adults
to be children of divorce.  During the years in which today's
Generation Xers were born (1965-1977), the divorce rate in the
U.S. doubled.  The percent of children born
outside of wedlock also doubled during that time period -- the
result not so much of a broken <I>marriage</I> vow as of a broken
promise to <I>love</I>.  Consequently, more than 40 percent of
today's young adults spent at least some time in a single-parent
family by age 16.
<P>
The argument that Generation X's aversion to divorce developed
from their witnessing too many broken marriage promises is strengthened
by the attitudinal consistency which Generation X exhibits in
other areas of life.
<P>
For example, articles analyzing the Gen X culture often describe
Xers as &quot;skeptical,&quot; &quot;insecure,&quot; or &quot;cautious&quot;
-- attitudes which have largely been influenced by broken or flippantly-made
promises.
<P>
To expound, Generation X analysts say young adults are &quot;skeptical&quot;
of media hype because too many commercials and advertisements
make far-flung promises which they cannot deliver.  Analysts also
say that Xers are &quot;insecure&quot; about finances and future
stability because the American dream they were promised of surpassing
the wealth of their parents has, in reality, dim prospects.  And,
according to a recent <I>American Demographics</I> article, Gen
Xers are &quot;cautious romantics.&quot;  They marry at later
ages, increasing their economic and emotional stability in the
hopes of avoiding divorce and the broken promises of a marriage
vow.
<P>
Clearly, the message of Promise Keepers responds to the anxieties
of today's young adults.  But the fact that Promise Keepers is
not limited to the young should make the young, in particular,
celebrate.  For, perhaps now more than ever, young adults <I>need</I>
role models.  Far too many of their primary role models (i.e.
parents) have failed to model successful marriages.  And as a
result, Generation X could well be the most well-intentioned but
least-equipped adult age group in terms of keeping their marriage
vows.
<P>
Thus, encouraging older men to be &quot;Promise Keepers&quot;
will, among other benefits, help the young maintain their resolve.
 And that is the hope of the Promise Keepers movement -- that
the advancements begun by these rallies will positively impact
generations to come.
<P>
Lest there be any misunderstanding:  I am not suggesting that
the Promise Keepers movement is a cure-all for divorce or that
it is the singular solution for eradicating broken promises. 
But, this movement is definitely promising...for both young and
old alike.

  DRUG LEGALIZATION</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
ABC television recently aired a documentary which suggested that
America has lost the drug war and now must embrace legalization.
 &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot; includes
a litany of distortions:
<P>
<LI>Anti-drug programs are called a failure.  In fact, America's
balanced strategy of prevention-treatment-enforcement turned the
drug problem around in the 1980s.  Drug pushers are gaining today
because the Clinton Administration has abandoned the offensive.
   
<P>
<LI>ABC argues that legalizing drugs will reduce crime.  It cites
anecdotal information from foreign countries as proof.  But these
&quot;facts&quot; are refuted by reports from the same countries
and from America's own experience.
<P>
<LI> ABC touts drug treatment as a better alternative to enforcement.
 It profiles closely controlled and very limited foreign experiments
as evidence.  But those countries still have major illicit drug
problems and ABC admits that drug treatment more often fails than
it succeeds.  
<P>
<LI>ABC labels those opposed to legalization or &quot;harm reduction&quot;
as motivated by fear.  In fact, there is clear scientific evidence
to demonstrate that even &quot;mild&quot; drugs like marijuana
have serious health consequences.
<P>
ABC correctly reports that drug abuse is once again on the rise,
especially among children, and that &quot;America shows few signs
of rethinking its drug strategy.&quot;  Although hostess Catherine
Crier claimed that her objective is to &quot;stir up public debate&quot;
and &quot;not to advocate any specific policy,&quot; many of the
program's guests are known members of the drug legalization movement.
 The program promoted a drug philosophy called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
which includes legalization.
<P>
Harm reduction, endorsed by most legalizers and to a certain extent
by the Clinton Administration, calls for more treatment and less
enforcement.  It views the use of illegal drugs as a health issue
rather than be a crime problem.  
<P>
ABC's presentation ignores history.  The U.S. experimented with
legalization from 1919 to 1922, when government-sponsored clinics
handed out free drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their
behavior.  The effort failed.  Society's 
revulsion against drugs, combined with enforcement, virtually
eradicated the menace at the time.
<P>
Crier cites society's high cost for illegal drug use each year
at $67 billion.  But she fails to compare those costs with the
high costs of two popular legal drugs: alcohol, $99 billion and
smoking, $72 billion.  At the program's end, Crier admits that
decriminalization will lead to more use. 
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that drug decriminalization
will cost society more than alcohol and tobacco combined, perhaps
$140-$210 billion a year in lost productivity and job-related
accidents. 
<P>
An article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
found that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial
accidents, 85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase
in absenteeism.&quot;  Insurance companies would pass accident
expenses on to consumers.
<P>
Once drugs are legal, it will be very difficult, if not impossible,
to turn the clock back.  Today, there are few calls for recriminalization
of alcohol even though the evidence shows that prohibition saved
lives.  Alcohol use declined by 30 to 50 percent during prohibition
and deaths from cirrhosis of the liver fell dramatically.  Mark
Moore, Harvard professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The
real lesson of prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a
dent in the consumption of drugs through law.&quot;
<P>
Unfortunately, ABC provides one sympathetic anecdotal account
of a drug abuser entrapped by stiff laws; meanwhile, it ignores
thousands of families who have been devastated by drug abuse.
 There was no reference to diminished public safety, increased
victimization, or increased family violence and child abuse caused
by individuals under the influence of illegal drugs.  And statistics,
such as the claim that 15 percent of the population smoke pot,
go unsubstantiated.
<P>
Instead, the viewer is introduced to &quot;harm reduction&quot;
programs in Holland and Britain and told that tolerance rather
than punishment works.  A Dutch official explains that legalizing
marijuana resulted in no increase in crime.  
<P>
ABC was either unaware of or ignored a study by Dr. K. F. Gunning,
President of the Dutch National Committee on Drug Prevention,
who found a 250 percent increase in cannabis use among students
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.
<P>
American social scientists have confirmed a relationship between
drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990 study published in
the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found a strong association between
the severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the
more intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.
<P>
Although ABC reported that in Britain, heroin addicts in small
experimental programs have not committed many crimes, Great Britain's
previous &quot;harm reduction&quot; efforts dispute these claims.
 The British sponsored a program of controlled distribution of
heroin between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical
Journal</I>, the number of heroin addicts doubled every 16 months
and the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in
criminal activity as well.
<P>
Undoubtedly, getting money for drugs is a motive for some crime,
but many criminals use drugs when committing crimes.  For example,
the U.S. Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  
<P>
ABC cited California's experiment with marijuana legalization
which allegedly saved a billion dollars in law enforcement costs.
 What it didn't mention is a study that found that within the
first six months after decriminalization, arrests for driving
under the influence of drugs rose 46 percent for adults and 71.4
percent for juveniles.  Decriminalizing marijuana in Alaska and
Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling of use and efforts
to recriminalize.
<P>
Crier reports that we have more than 300,000 people in jail for
drug-related offenses and later says that drug use would rise
with legalization.  She fails to reconcile more abuse with less
crime.  In fact, the 1993 Justice Department &quot;Sourcebook&quot;
shows 97,999 inmates charged with a drug offense and that most
inmates (79.4 percent) have used drugs. 
<P>
ABC also failed to mention that if drugs were legalized some restrictions
still would be necessary.  For example, Holland restricts the
sale of legalized drugs to minors, pregnant women, police, military,
pilots and prisoners.  There is no way the government could legally
sanction demonstrably harmful drugs like PCP and LSD, and less
potent marijuana would not satisfy users when far stronger pot
became available on the black market.  A black market niche for
these drugs would be inevitable.
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;  This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers and clearly hurt the American taxpayer and
American families.
<P>
Despite significant evidence that all hard drug users used gateway
drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana) before they used hard drugs
(cocaine, PCP, heroin), ABC includes comments by &quot;harm reduction&quot;
advocates who dismiss the &quot;gateway&quot; theory of drug abuse
and the health risks associated with marijuana.
<P>
A 1992 article in <I>The Journal of Primary Prevention</I> found
that marijuana use is essentially a &quot;necessary&quot; condition
for the occurrence of cocaine use.  Other research shows that
involvement with illicit drugs is a developmental phenomenon,
age correlates with use, and cigarette and alcohol use precedes
marijuana use.  Polydrug use is often an indication of transition
to the more addictive substance.   
<P>
Dr. Carlton Turner, former  director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the
University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There is no other drug
used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular
actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does.&quot;
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use. 
The short term effects of marijuana include impairment in motivation
learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.
 Pot consumption can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.
<P>
The long-term effects are far more serious.  One study found large
numbers of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  A
study in <I>Cancer</I> found that children of women who smoke
marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.  Mothers
who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight and developmental
problems for their children and increase by as much as 500 percent
the risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome. 
<P>
ABC may stir up public debate but &quot;America's War on Drugs&quot;
was not a responsible and balanced presentation.  &quot;Harm reduction&quot;
creates more problems than it solves.  Although a balanced policy
of treatment, prevention and strong enforcement works, the Clinton
administration has cut enforcement while Congress is cutting prevention
programs.  
<P>
America needs leaders committed to the drug war.  At present,
the debate is mired down in rhetoric while drug abuse among children
worsens.

<TITLE>FAMILIES NEED TAX FREEDOM</TITLE>

<P>
Now that May
6 has finally arrived, families across America can breathe a sigh
of relief.  For May 6 is Tax Freedom Day, the day when Americans
cease working to support The Tax Man and start working to support
their families.
<P>
That's right, when you calculate how many days
one would have to work to pay off all the taxes owed by the average
taxpayer, the Tax Foundation in Washington reports that one would
not be free to keep their own earnings until May 6.
<P>
 But if the
new Republican House of Representatives has its way, tax freedom
will come sooner in the future.
<P>
The House recently passed a major
income tax cut that was hailed as the &quot;crown jewel&quot;
of its Contract with America.  The tax cut bill had a number of
 important pro-family features -- including a provision to make
it easier to claim home office deductions and a provision to write
off expenses associated with adopting a child.  But no provision
in the bill is as important as the bill's centerpiece:  a new
$500 children's tax credit for taxpaying parents.
<P>
The $500 children's
tax credit is designed to address the steady erosion in per-child
tax benefits that has occurred over the last four decades.  This
erosion in per-child benefits is part of the reason the average
family today sends Uncle Sam nearly a quarter of every dollar
earned, whereas the average family in 1950 sent only two-cents
of every dollar earned to the federal government.  And it is the
chief reason several national commissions -- including the 1986
White House Working Group on the Family and the 1991 National
Commission on Children -- made pro-family tax relief their top
policy recommendation.
<P>
  Unfortunately, the fate of the House GOP's
tax cut bill is very uncertain in the Senate.  Several key Republican
Senators -- most especially, Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Packwood (R-OR) -- have publicly raised doubts about tax cuts
in general, and the per-child tax credit in particular.  Others,
like Senators Dan Coats (R-IN) and Rod Grams (R-MN), have pledged
to take a $500 tax credit proposal to the Senate floor if Packwood
blocks committee passage of a bill patterned after the House GOP
Contract.
<P>
The fact that parents need tax relief can be seen not
just in the economic statistics showing a dramatic rise in the
tax burden facing Americans, but also in the
cultural statistics William Bennett publishes showing a dramatic
decline in the various indices of family well-being.  
<P>
To be sure,
pro-family tax relief cannot single-handedly solve these problems.
 Pro-family tax relief cannot cause husbands to love their wives
or children to respect their parents.  It cannot clean up filthy
TV or remove child predators from neighborhood streets.  It cannot
improve the quality of America's schools.
<P>
In short, pro-family
tax relief cannot, by itself, magically solve the various social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.
<P>
But
pro-family tax-relief will make it easier for families to thrive
by reducing economic stress on financially-strapped parents. 
It will make it easier for time-starved parents to monitor their
children's TV viewing habits and after-school play activities
and educational studies.
<P>
In essence, pro-family tax relief will
empower parents to address many family needs that only they can
meet.  As such, pro-family tax relief is a useful complement to
the cuts in wasteful government and social programs. 
<P>
 Hopefully,
the full Senate will soon adopt a $500 tax credit for children.
 Such a credit is needed, if Tax Freedom Day is to come any sooner
in the years ahead.

John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed `short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, according to the New Jersey Department of Human
Services, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New
Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Because
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (11.4 percent, according to the Department of Human Services),
the fact that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is
particularly significant.      
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together 
filed a class-action suit over the New Jersey family cap, both
commented in telephone interviews that the class was certified
to include welfare mothers who had aborted their babies -- but
that neither one could locate a woman who had actually aborted
in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <U>Evangelium Vitae</U> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended -- not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se --
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.
<P>
Echoing Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare commissioner
Eloise Anderson observes: &quot;Working women do not get automatic
raises when they have children.  Why should our expectations of
a woman on AFDC be any different than any other woman?  Do we
think they're stupider or less capable of being rational?&quot;
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.
<P>
Even the most conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent) vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Daniel Patrick Moynihan envisioned 30 years ago.
<P>
James Q. Wilson explains the moral implications of economic incentives:
&quot;Virtue is not learned by precept; it is learned by the regular
repetition of right actions. . . .  Seen this way, there is no
conflict between economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter
simply supplies a fuller statement of the uses to which the former
can and should be put.  We induce habits of right conduct by arranging
confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their daily
lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers begging to be cultivated, rather
than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<P>
Yet, conservatives must take care to acknowledge that government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine,
but never instill, virtue.  Rather than attempting to devise the
perfect bundle of carrots and sticks, we must eliminate altogether
the government subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions
by shielding them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <U>The
Road to Serfdom</U>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
 Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described in his famous report
will only continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms
and ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is
true that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<TITLE>THE CASE AGAINST THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</TITLE>

<H2>THE CASE AGAINST<BR>

<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer A. Marshall and Eric Unsworth</I></CENTER>
<P>
A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville
recognized that increased centralization and bureaucratization
take away civic and individual responsibility: &quot;[A] centralized
administration is fit only to enervate the nations in which it
exists, by incessantly diminishing their local spirit.&quot;
<P>
It
isn't just fiscal crisis that necessitates the latest round of
proposed budget cuts -- our social crisis demands that the role
of the federal government be cut back.  Bureaucracies like the
US Education Department breed local apathy and mediocrity and
should be eliminated -- even if we had a budget surplus.
<P>
Once upon
a time the federal role in education was constitutional: it had
none. Things began to change in the 1930s when the New Deal brought
increasing federal involvement.  Later, under President Eisenhower,
Congress created the cabinet-level Department of  Health, Education
and Welfare.  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson rammed through Congress
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which vastly expanded
federal involvement.
<P>
Then, in 1976, candidate Jimmy Carter promised
a separate education department and received the backing of the
National Education Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President
Carter, facing a liberal challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.),
set about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition
from the American Federation of Teachers, from much of higher
education, and from the general public.  The AFL-CIO attacked
the idea and even the Washington Post argued that bureaucratic
costs would increase.
<P>
Marvin Stone, writing for U.S. News &amp;
World Report, articulated the fears of many Americans:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Though the bill establishing the department
stated emphatically that state and local control would not be
undermined, Stone was not convinced, citing a &quot;subtle schizophrenia
meandering through the legislation&quot; that revealed the authors'
true intentions. 
<P>
The US Education Department,
then, is a bureaucracy with a dubious past.  Its conception was
of doubtful legitimacy, given the strictures of the Constitution
and tradition.  The circumstances of its birth were also suspect
-- more or less a political payoff to the NEA.  And the US Education
Department has not improved American education.
<P>
Before its creation,
President Carter could point to &quot;[o]ur Nation's pluralistic
education system&quot; as &quot;the most competent and open in
the world.&quot;  No longer so.  According to former Secretary
of Education William Bennett, more than 90 percent of the students
entering US colleges today would not be admitted to institutions
of higher learning anywhere else in the world.
<P>
Meanwhile, the US
Education Department has grown into a huge bureaucratic &quot;blob,&quot;
 elbowing its way into places it does not belong.  Federal intrusiveness
reached a new height with passage of Goals 2000, which John Jennings,
director of the Center on National Education Policy, calls &quot;a
monumental movement away from local control of education&quot;
(emphasis added).
<P>
Goals 2000 promotes national education goals
and standards that override local priorities and ignore the fact
that many private entities have developed gauges for student learning.
 University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch has written a series
of books on cultural literacy, describing fundamentals of education
at each grade level.  The Family Research Council has published
an outline of US history entitled Let Freedom Ring.  William Bennett's
best-selling Book of Virtues is a wonderful source on America's
literary heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for a
high academic standard.
<P>
How is it possible that a program like
Goals 2000 -- quite inimical to American tradition -- has become
the manual for running local schools?  Partly through subterfuge:
 the insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly
because the profound crisis of American education has convinced
many that only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.
 But this conviction is based on a fallacy:  the fallacy that
the federal government has money of its own.  Our culture of dependency
has forgotten that the only money the US Education Department
or any other federal agency has, is money that citizens have earned.
<P>
Tocqueville's
lesson has been relearned in our times:  centralization and huge
bureaucracies don't work very well. That truth swept away the
regimes of the Soviet Union and half a host of other countries.
 Finally, it's beginning to hit home, too.  
<P>
Today, no politician
would dare highlight the facts which President Carter touted in
his proposal for a US Education Department:  over 150 programs,
16,200 employees, and a budget of more than $13 billion, making
Education larger than five other departments.  Such big-government
philosophy has been rightfully stigmatized.  
<P>
Bureaucracy must
be pruned back to effect a renewal of the local spirit that Alexis
de Tocqueville praised so highly in 1835: 
<UL> I know of no people
who have established schools so numerous and efficacious, places
of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants,
or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity or permanence of design,
the minute arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative
system must not be sought for in the United States; what we find
there is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild,
is at least robust, and an existence checkered with accidents,
indeed, but full of animation and effort.</UL>
<P>It's time to disestablish
the US Education Department -- for the sake of American education,
our fiscal health, and the renewal of local spirit.

<title>A MAN OF HIS WORD</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>A MAN OF HIS WORD</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<p>
Anne Ellsworth Redd</i></center>
<p>
In a 17th century poem by Richard Lovelace, a soldier, who is just
about to go to war, explains
to his grieving lover, &quot;I could not love thee, dear, so much/
Loved I not honor more.&quot;  He is saying that his very expression
of love depends upon his character, his honor.  It seems that
this concept -- that a man's contribution in life and love would
depend upon his faithfulness to integrity -- is lost to us today.
 Some say that this kind of man no longer exists, or, even, that
he never did exist.  But this is the kind of man my father is.
<p>
There was a time, when I was in high school, that my dad proved his
faithfulness to me in a way that moves me, years later.  As a
surface naval officer, he was away from home for much of my last
three years of high school.  High school is a challenging (put
mildly) time for the best of us.  I had certain ideas about my
independence and made all kinds of mistakes in an effort to &quot;find
myself.&quot;  The very last people that I was interested in were
my parents.
<p>
Throughout this period (perhaps you're familiar with
the poetic, brooding, black-turtleneck stage?) my father wrote
me letters -- weekly, if not more.  I remember them well:  long,
sincere letters on heavy white stationery, written in his own
trademark hand and folded over once.  He told me that he loved
me, he asked me about my life and my interests, he described places
that he visited and challenges that he faced, he shared ideas
about life and God.
<p>
In one memorable letter, he told me that
he understood that I wanted to be &quot;free,&quot; and said that
he and my mother wanted to give me as much freedom as they possibly
could.  &quot;But there are two kinds of decisions,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;important decisions and <i>life-changing</i> decisions.  The latter
will profoundly affect you for the rest of your life.  These decisions
are decisions about sex, about drugs, about college...&quot; and
he went on to list some of these life-changing decisions (he is
always frank).  He said that he and my mother needed to be a part
of these latter decisions.  Though I took all of the letters and
good advice for granted at the time, looking back I am moved by
the kind of faithfulness and love that would cause him to write
so consistently.
<p>
When I was in eighth grade, my father was diagnosed
with cancer.  The doctors operated, in an attempt to remove all
of the malignancy.  From the moment of his learning of his illness
and throughout his hospitalization, I remember his strength. 
There were tears and hugs of love, and there was much pain.  But
there was strength under it all, and a complete
selflessness in his suffering.  He was cured, thankfully, but
he and my mother both used the pain as an opportunity to grow
-- as an exercise in faith.
<p>
In the face of cancer, long hours,
six-month-long deployments, and all the other things that life
brings with it, he has kept his promise to my mother and to God
by remaining faithful to her.  Their marriage has been a partnership,
a friendship, a haven, and a love affair.  The commitment that
my parents have for each other has modeled for us, their children,
faithfulness in a world sadly lacking it.  His faithfulness to
me, his daughter, has laid a foundation of dignity and confidence
that should serve me well in my family and career.  And he has
been a model for my brothers of the kind of man each of them should
strive to be.
<p>
As a naval officer, my dad works hard  to serve his
country.  As a leader, he is uncompromising in his beliefs, unflinching
in his morals, and unrelenting in his pursuit of excellence. 
Though we tease him that he sounds like a broken record, my dad
talks often about what he calls the fundamentals of leadership
-- Vision, Excellence, Character, Teamwork, Respect.  He has a
commitment to truth and goodness that doesn't depend on popular
opinion or trends.
<p>
A true man initiates in leadership, in integrity,
<i>and</i> in apology.  He is the first to make a stand for what is right,
and he is the first to admit when he is wrong.  In fact, a true
man may often find himself standing alone in this society.  But
he will always find himself standing.  As a leader, my dad is
honest about his failures and weaknesses, and he strives to learn
from them.  He is not perfect (and he will be the first to say
so), but he is persevering.  He is not faultless, but he is faithful.
 These things make him great.
<p>
In a society shaken by divorce and
marital unfaithfulness, we need men who keep their promises. 
In a culture sated with drugs and MTV and O.J. Simpson and &quot;safe
sex,&quot; we need men who are ready to lead a more radical movement
-- an Integrity Movement.  We need leaders with the compassion
for victims of this culture, and who, like Lovelace's soldier,
have the conviction to lift up a brighter and clearer standard
of living for everyone.
<p>
When we accept the premise that we are
trapped in cultural quicksand -- that we cannot demand more from
our youth or our leaders -- we have lost our hope in the soul's
potential, and we have denied the evidence of the lives of men
like my dad.

<title>UN THREATENS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>UN THREATENS<br>
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
The operational philosophy and military role of the United Nations
have radically changed.  In the UN's first five years it launched
only two peacekeeping missions, but since the fall of the Soviet
Union the UN has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000
blue-helmeted soldiers.  Last year these operations cost $3.6
billion.  The U.S. was assessed $1.2 billion and the Clinton Administration
spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military participation in
UN missions.  Today, thousands of American soldiers wear UN blue
helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon to the former
Yugoslav republics.
<p>
Indeed, the UN has experienced a renaissance with the unexpected
fall of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early
1980s to worldwide peacemaker in 1995.
<p>
Harvard fellow Ronnie Dugger has called for the creation of a
United Nations military force composed of volunteer peacekeepers
financed by global citizen-members who pay dues and carry citizenship
cards.  If that doesn't fly, Dugger told <i>New York Times</i>
readers in June, perhaps nongovernmental organizations like Greenpeace
could become citizen-members of their own international agency
and elect a world parliament to pass and enforce laws through
a voluntary military force. 
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the UN as an organization dealing
with traditional inter-state aggression rather than the type of
internal conflicts that now dominate its agenda.  But the 50-year-old
organization is transitioning to the &quot;new world order.&quot;
 That change is echoed by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
 who has issued <I>An Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly
expanded UN peacemaking role.  He endorses the principle of &quot;universal&quot;
sovereignty:  &quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and
the rights of peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty
that resides in all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate
involvement in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;
<p>
Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction UN efforts in
Somalia: 
<P>
&quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes a threat
to international peace and security.&quot;  This justified the
world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation.  The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf
War. 
<p>
The 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
UN, a case of aggression in which the armies of one state crossed
international borders to invade another.  Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to expel the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait.  The follow-on 1991 UN-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force to address strictly internal affairs of a member
state.  Thus began a dangerous new era for UN &quot;peacemaking.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Loose constructionists of the UN Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding UN jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest.  Is this what we want to do?
 Someone had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;
<p>
But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries.  He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
 Outside forces, then, do have a right to trump national sovereignty.
<p>
The UN's &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign affairs
of a country leaves all member countries, including the U.S.,
vulnerable to having their own sovereign territory compromised.
  For example, the next time Korean Americans bear the brunt of
a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could ask the
UN to intervene to protect its citizens' rights.   It couldn't
happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally and
militarily.  But it could happen in the future, especially if
the UN has a standing military governed by a liberal world community.
<p>
There is no shortage of potential Bosnia-like situations on the
horizon.  The conscious choices that the international community
makes about these situations will decide the new order.  We can
only hope that the UN will avoid the temptation to resolve these
problems with the sword.
<p>
Meanwhile, the UN's military focus has been growing.  The UN Department
of Peacekeeping has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350
with a modern situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked
electronically to all UN hot spots.  It has a standby system to
tap troops and equipment from 185 member nations and it has established
a base in Italy to stockpile equipment like armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.  
<p>
There have been calls for a standing UN Army.  Former French President
Francois Mitterand endorsed the creation of a &quot;UN Legion.&quot;
 This brigade-size unit of thousands  would be available for immediate
deployment when the Security Council authorizes military action.
 A &quot;UN Legion&quot; has been discussed at the U.S. Army Peacekeeping
Institute, where representatives from various U.S. government
agencies met with UN representatives in 1993 and 1994.  Anticipating
future trends, the U.S. Army recently published a field manual
entitled &quot;Peace Operations&quot; outlining relationships
with the UN and including extracts from the UN Charter.
<p>
Last year the Clinton Administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive-25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
 This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
 The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
UN Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in UN operations.&quot;  
<p>
Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry
said President Clinton supports America's continued UN involvement
and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative to the
United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton Administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the UN system.&quot;
<p>
The Clinton Administration has overseen the UN's radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share the optimism.  Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole said, &quot;It is high time we rein in UN peacekeeping,
which is out of control.&quot;  Senator Jesse Helms called the
UN &quot;the nemesis of millions of Americans.&quot;  
<p>
We must heed the warning signs.  History teaches that the acquisition
of military power traditionally has been the first step toward
establishing governance over a territory.  Coupling the UN's changing
military strength with the new operational philosophy favoring
individual over state sovereignty sends a warning flare that no
liberty loving people can afford to ignore.

<title>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES IN BEIJING</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES<br>
IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
While there has been much speculation as to whether Hillary Clinton
will or will not attend the United Nations Fourth World Conference
on Women, much less attention has been given to the U.N. document
itself and what its impact will be on the family.  The U.N. conference
-- to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995 --
is supposed to advance women's rights around the world.  However,
the document reveals a much different reality -- one which attempts
to reinvent traditional families and family values.
<p>
Consider only a few of the Beijing document's most egregious violations:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrating the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  The word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout
the entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed so
that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;  [Bracketed
sections indicate that delegates could not agree on the text.
 These sections are to be discussed further, with each alternative
weighed equally.]  Moreover, the word &quot;family&quot; almost
always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation to domestic
violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devaluing the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Gender is open for interpretation.</B>  While &quot;gender&quot;
appears more than 200 times in the platform document, the U.N.
fails to define the term.  During a preparatory 
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Parents are irrelevant in adolescent health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  The document refuses to recognize that parents
should play a vital role in their children's reproductive health
decisions.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 The platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands and
fathers, and argues that women should be completely autonomous
in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the platform urges
governments to &quot;take action to ensure that women's sexual
and reproductive rights are fully recognized and respected&quot;
(paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems to elevate reproductive
&quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating that &quot;the
ability of women to control their own fertility forms an important
basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot; (paragraph 98).
</UL>
<P>
Americans, in greater and greater numbers, are rejecting the radical
feminist agenda that has spawned many of the social problems now
confronting our nation.  The Clinton Administration should take
a lesson and remove the United States from promoting this to the
rest of the world in Beijing.

<title>SHANNON FAULKNER IS GONE</title>

<p>
<h2>FAULKNER IS GONE, BUT<br>
BATTLE OVER SINGLE-SEX<br>
SCHOOLS THREATENS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Shannon Faulkner's decision to quit The Citadel does not stop
the battle over state-sponsored same-sex education.  That controversy
won't even be resolved when a federal judge decides whether an
alternative for women at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C.
eliminates the need for a co-ed Citadel program, and daily reports
of Faulkner replacements or other touching profiles of military
women won't change the issue.  The gender assault goes much farther.
<P>
The Clinton Justice Department will take this case to the Supreme
Court and the high court could strike down public funded single-gender
education forever -- damaging America's academic diversity.  That
is a serious threat.
<P>
The Citadel's loss of the Faulkner trial would threaten the more
than 80 all-women's colleges that depend on taxpayer support.
That's why some of these colleges have expressed their support
for The Citadel in amicus briefs.  Their fear is that prohibitions
against direct funding of single-sex educational institutions
would lead to prohibitions against &quot;indirect funding&quot;
of single-sex colleges through federal financial aid and tax exemptions.
 This would make it difficult for any single-sex educational institution
to survive.
<P>
A diversified educational system should include single-sex schools
because same-gender settings are best for some students.  The
benefits of single-sex schools for some students are marked. 
Students do better academically, and women tend to pursue majors
in science, math and management, hold more leadership positions,
and are more likely to seek higher academic degrees.  Both genders
are more likely to participate in
honors programs and pursue careers in business, law or teaching,
and both sexes tend to find their overall academic experience
more rewarding.
<P>
One argument raised by critics of single-sex educational institutions
is that schools like The Citadel exacerbate the bias against women.
 But over the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase
in the educational attainment of women in this country.  Diane
Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of education in the Bush
Administration, reports that:  67 percent of women high school
graduates go to college, compared to 58 percent of men; 55 percent
of all college undergraduates are women; women earn 59 percent
of all master's degrees; and women earn 39 percent of all doctoral
degrees, up from 14 percent in 1970.
<P>
Besides enhancing academic diversity, single-sex education can
help curb the epidemic of youth violence.  Same-gender schools
have emerged as a means to help at-risk inner city boys -- especially
those in elementary school.
<P>
Same-sex settings give boys a greater chance to succeed in life.
 Boys learn most when they perceive their teacher as a disciplinarian
and competitor.  They respond better to teaching based on the
adversary model of education, which incorporates contest and competition
in a disciplined environment.  And male teachers provide possibly
the only male role model alternative to a street gang leader for
some inner-city boys.  
<P>
Single-sex schools for girls have a positive academic effect and
protect them from aggressive boys.  They have better affective
outcomes and higher test scores.  They also enjoy higher self-esteem
than their co-ed peers.
<P>
Studies have shown that single-gender education works in the inner
city.  Seventh graders who had attended the Malcolm X Academy
in Detroit, an all-boys inner city school, had the highest math
scores among 77 Detroit schools and the second highest in Michigan
among 780 schools.
<P>
Cornelius Riordan, a professor at Providence University, found
that African-American and Hispanic students in single-gender schools
outperformed their coed peers by nearly a grade level.  And inner
city single-mothers recognize the value of same-sex schools, especially
for boys.
<P>
Unfortunately, single-gender public schools are illegal because
they allegedly discriminate based on gender.   Groups like the
American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization of
Women have threatened to file lawsuits claiming a violation of
Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  These are the same groups
which lined-up behind Shannon Faulkner's fight with The Citadel.
<P>
Some critics of single-sex education compare policies that exclude
because of gender to policies that discriminate according to race.
 They contend that the issues involved in The Citadel case are
the same as those in the 1954 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v.
Board of Education</I>.  But this is a false analogy.
<P>
Gender differences are very different from racial differences.
 In some parts of the country, races were once segregated on public
transportation, in schools and in bathrooms.  But when racial
segregation finally ended, beneficial forms of segregation by
gender continued.  We continue to have &quot;separate but equal&quot;
male and female public bathrooms because most people recognize
that gender is different than race.
<P>
The battle over state-funded single-sex classes is not about bigotry
and is not a civil rights &quot;retreat.&quot;  The truth is single-gender
schools diversify America's educational experience and provide
wider options to individuals -- both women and men -- that might
benefit greatly from them.   They also give constructive male
role models to fatherless boys growing up in inner-cities.

<title>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</title>

<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S<br>
WAR ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
In Pennsylvania, a rapist brought a custody suit against the family
who had adopted the child he fathered by his rape of a 13-year-old
girl.  In Georgia, a transsexual attempted to sue the state health
department to pay for a sex change operation.  In New York, a
public housing tenant who had committed a drug crime fought his
eviction on the grounds that he could not be evicted without 30
days' prior notification.  And in another Georgia case, a petition
was filed to release a murderer who had killed his grandparents,
because they refused to give him their car keys.
<P>
What do all of these disturbing cases have in common?  You and
I paid for them.  That's right, our tax dollars, channeled through
the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), funded these cases and many
more like them over the past twenty-one years to the tune of $5
billion.  
<P>
LSC, which is a non-profit corporation set up by the federal government,
supposedly helps poor people gain access to expensive legal services.
 In actuality, it has been a deep well of anti-family litigation
that has helped to expand welfare dependency, divorce, abortion,
and the homosexual political agenda.  LSC has also been active
in eroding legal protections for the traditional family, pushing
the radical &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda, and making prisons
cozy for criminals.
<P>
When it comes to families in crisis, LSC grantees seem to be more
interested in facilitating divorce than in helping to repair marriages.
 LSC grantees have argued that mediation, an important way of
resolving domestic disputes, &quot;should be avoided because the
woman is always at a disadvantage.&quot;  They have also advised
lawyers working on divorce agreements to reduce the father's visitation
time and to avoid cash settlements so that the mother can be eligible
for welfare.  The agenda here is clear:  break up the family and
replace dad with a welfare check.
<P>
While encouraging welfare dependence, LSC programs have also blocked
attempts at welfare reform.  The most well-known case is in New
Jersey, where LSC once again joined its frequent co-litigators,
the ACLU and the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense
Fund.  They argued that the state's capping of welfare payments
to mothers who have additional children while on welfare violated
a woman's right to procreate.  Likewise, LSC programs have put
their muscle behind efforts to block welfare reform in California,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas,
and Maine.
<P>
LSC lawsuits have also helped subsidize the destructive habits
of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC grantees
have helped thousands of substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks courtesy of employers and taxpayers.
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  Throughout the years, LSC
grantees have worked hard to make sure that prisons look more
like country clubs than places to incarcerate dangerous offenders.
 Such efforts have increased the costs of jailing criminals, putting
many back on the streets where they prey mainly on the very people
LSC is supposed to protect.
<P>
Since 1977, LSC grantees have been prohibited from involvement
in abortion-related cases.  Nonetheless, LSC programs have remained
firm in their commitment to abortion on demand and have worked
around the law, attempting to secure unlimited taxpayer-funded
abortions.  In several cases throughout the country, LSC grantees
have worked against waiting periods, parental consent, and parental
notification.  LSC programs have been involved in most of the
major cases in the history of abortion litigation, including <I>Doe
v. Bolton</I>, the companion case to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.  
<P>
You would think that the new Republican-controlled Congress, with
its mandate to control spending and reduce government intervention
in people's lives, would be chomping at the bit to defund such
nonsense.  But even among Republicans, this pot of gold for the
far left has its supporters who are working to ensure its survival.
 Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee,
has been working to save LSC by retaining funding along with some
new &quot;reform&quot; provisions.  Meanwhile, in the Senate,
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's Labor and Human Resources Committee has
held hearings aimed at extending LSC's life.
<P>
Saving LSC would be a big mistake for Congress.  LSC should be
defunded, saving the taxpayers $415 million a year, plus untold
billions in legislative impact and litigation costs.  It doesn't
make sense for Congress to fund the groups that will turn around
and sue to undo the reforms it was elected to enact.
<P>
The legal profession itself should do more to help the poor. 
For too long, taxpayers have subsidized one of the most lucrative
professions by relieving it of a portion of its responsibility
to do pro bono work for the poor.  The $255 million a year in
non-federal support for LSC-type programs demonstrates that there
is great potential to meet the legitimate legal needs of the poor
without burdening the taxpayer.
<P>
LSC is remarkably resistant to reform and oversight.  The structure
of the program guarantees that it will remain unaccountable and
uncontrollable until Congress pulls the plug.  There are better
ways to help the poor.  LSC <I>should </I>be abolished.

<title>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</title>

<p>
<h2>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
The &quot;gender feminist&quot; agenda embodied within the Platform
for Action of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women
is a direct attack on the family as we know it.  The conference,
which is to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995,
purports to advance women's rights, but the Platform itself reveals
a clear intention to promote &quot;gender feminism.&quot;
<P>
The Beijing document -- the text of which was heavily influenced
by Bella Abzug and other radical feminists -- includes over 200
references to &quot;gender&quot; in various contexts, i.e., &quot;gender
equality,&quot; &quot;mainstreaming a gender perspective,&quot;
&quot;gender diversity,&quot; etc.  However, &quot;husband&quot;
and &quot;wife&quot; are nowhere to be found in the 121-page document,
and the terms &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;family&quot; are up
for debate against the proposed substitutes of &quot;caretaker&quot;
and &quot;household&quot; respectively.  Clearly, the effort to
change the semantics associated with the family is the first step
in altering the way the world thinks about the family.
<P>
But why are gender feminists so intent on redefining the family?
 Because gender feminists believe that the husband-wife relationship
is inherently oppressive to women and that the traditional family
propagates this &quot;oppression.&quot;  Radical feminist Shulamith
Firestone wrote in 1970 that &quot;the heart of women's oppression
is her [sic] childbearing and child rearing roles.&quot;
<P>
Thus, gender feminists envision a brave new world in which reproduction
is <I>socially-constructed</I>, rather than biologically-determined.
 Firestone argues that &quot;the elimination of sexual classes
requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and seizure of control
of reproduction, restoration to women of ownership of their own
bodies, as well as feminine control of human fertility....so that
the end goal [is]...not just the elimination of male privilege
but of the sex distinction itself; genital differences between
human beings would no longer matter culturally.&quot;  Moreover,
feminist Alison Jagger asserts that &quot;the radical feminist
equality means not just equality under the law nor even equality
in satisfaction of basic needs; rather it means that women, like
men, should not have to bear children....  The destruction of
the biological family, never envisioned by Freud, will allow the
emergence of new women and men, different from any people who
have previously existed.&quot;
<P>
That the gender feminists have left their fingerprints on the
Beijing document is obvious.  From the document's emphasis on
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; (i.e., abortion and 
unlimited contraceptive availability, even to minors without parental
consent) to promoting &quot;gender equality&quot; and the mainstreaming
of a &quot;gender perspective,&quot; the document clearly seeks
to subvert the traditional family.
<P>
In all this, the United Nations has done nothing to defend natural
families.  When asked to define the term &quot;gender&quot; during
a preparatory meeting for the conference, the UN rejected the
proposal that &quot;gender&quot; should be defined as the biological
classifications of male and female.  The UN instead settled on
a non-descript, ineffectual definition that gender is to be understood
in &quot;its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  While the UN did
not embrace the feminist definition of &quot;socially-constructed
roles which society assigns to men and women&quot; (i.e., a spectrum
of genders, including heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and
transsexuals), it has left the door open to varying interpretations
of the term.
<P>
But despite the gender feminist agenda being incorporated into
the Beijing document, despite the Clinton Administration's backing
of the document, and despite the UN's dullness, the natural family
will not so easily succumb.  The crafters of the document, in
their attempt to advance a new worldview, still have much with
which to contend.
<P>
Biology, for instance.  Men and women differ biologically.  That
is a universally-recognized fact, not a socially-constructed idea.
 It is no wonder, then, that transsexual Kate Bornestein laments
the fact that &quot;the current gender system relies heavily on
everyone's agreement that it's inflexible.&quot;
<P>
Second, despite the rantings of radical feminists who say that
motherhood equals oppression, women worldwide will still freely
choose to bear and rear their children.  Some would even say that
mothering is a <I>natural</I> instinct within women, which is
why feminist Simone de Beauvoir believes that &quot;no woman should
be authorized to stay at home and raise her children...because
if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.&quot;
<P>
Third, despite their success in infiltrating the Beijing document
with their terminology, gender feminists must still hurdle many
other language &quot;barriers.&quot;  After all, Webster's dictionary
still defines &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the fact or condition
of being a male or a female human being....&quot;  Moreover, most
languages have no equivalent of the English term &quot;gender.&quot;
 Thus, even in the Beijing document, the phrase &quot;gender justice&quot;
is rendered in French as &quot;l'egalite entre les hommes et les
femmes,&quot; and in Spanish, the phrase &quot;gender-sensitive
initiatives&quot; translates to &quot;iniciativas que tengan en
cuenta las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres.&quot;
<P>
These gender feminists cannot hope to overthrow the family by
simply tinkering with a UN document.  But even with regard to
this UN document, families -- and women -- worldwide are seeing
to it that this radical feminist agenda will not be thrust upon
them without a fight.

<title>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK</title>

<p>
<h2>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK<br>
ON MARRIAGE, VIOLENCE<br>
AGAINST WOMEN</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Ambassador Madeleine Albright will present US priorities to the
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in early September.
 As the head of the US delegation, Albright promises &quot;to
see that American views and values are well represented.&quot;
 But some of those &quot;views and values&quot; are truly alien
to our traditions.
<P>
The conference's road map, &quot;Program for Action,&quot; was
heavily influenced by western feminists like Bella Abzug, a former
New York congresswoman, who is described as &quot;arguably the
most important lobbyist&quot; behind the UN conference.  According
to State Department sources, many of the US delegates to the Beijing
conference are members of the Women's Linkage Caucus (WLC) which
is headed by Ms. Abzug.
<P>
The WLC heavily influenced the 121-page UN document, including
a section on violence against women which falsely implies that
most violence against women takes place in the home.  The document
says, &quot;In many cases, violence against women and girls occurs
in the family or within the home, where violence is often tolerated&quot;
and goes on to say, &quot;[v]iolence against women encompasses...physical,
sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including
battering, sexual abuse of female children...marital rape.&quot;
 But a new Justice Department study indicates that the safest
place for a woman today is married and living with her husband.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; reports
that a woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.
 The study found that when all acts of violence against women
(rape/sexual assault, robbery and aggravated/simple assault) are
considered, married women are 30 times less likely than separated
women to become violence victims.  Moreover, 
married women are at least four times less likely than never-married
women to be crime victims.
<P>
The study also found that twenty-something women are the most likely
victims of violence.  They are twice as likely to become victims,
compared to teenagers and women in their 30s and 40s.  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
US Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married, and the younger cohort is more likely to
live in homes where there is a protecting father.
<P>
Even incidents of rape and sexual assault are low for married
women.  The 1995 study found that a woman is three times more
likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10
times more likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by an acquaintance
than by a spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped
and sexually assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.
<P>
Instead of spreading feminist propaganda, Ambassador Albright
ought to take this data to the Beijing Conference.  Perhaps the
delegates would rethink their stand on marriage.  The UN plan
includes only seven uses of the term &quot;marriage,&quot; and
the words &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are not found
at all.  This is an interesting omission, given that every great
society in history has been built upon the foundational concept
of family.
<P>
Ambassador Albright should embrace a message that works and not
failed feminist distortions.  If the conference &quot;on women
will affect directly the lives of half the people on earth,&quot;
as Albright claims, shouldn't her message be one that offers the
truth and solutions to violence rather than distortion and compromise?

<title>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A<br>
VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
&quot;Disheartening&quot; is how Steve Case, president of America
Online, describes his members' actions.  What did they do to deserve
this polite reproof?  They consumed and distributed the precious
merchandise of the child pornography meat market.
<p>
For some time now, pictures of  young bodies have been swapped
like baseball trading cards over computer networks.   It's time
to get serious, folks.  The Justice Department has, and deserves
praise for its efforts.
<p>
Laws prohibiting computer-transmitted child pornography have been
in place for years, but there has been a defacto decriminalization
of this material due to lack of enforcement.  That is finally
being corrected, but there is little to no prohibition of other
pornography-related activity in cyberspace.
<p>
Sure, there are obscenity laws that might apply, but the specter
of those laws does not loom large in cyberspace.  There is a &quot;freedom&quot;
there that exists nowhere else with regard to pornography -- an
environment virtually untroubled by legal injunction or deterrent.
 Indeed, if we consider cyberspace to be a little world of its
own, it is the type of world for which groups like the ACLU have
long fought, but fought in vain.
<p>
It will not remain this way.  Congress will soon make some final
decisions about how to address obscenity and indecency.   But
while it lasts, we ought to look closely at this &quot;control-group&quot;
society, if for no other reason than to assure ourselves that
our decades-old decisions to control pornography through law were
good ones.
<p>
With a few clicks of the mouse, today's computer novice can get
raw, even violent, sexual images once difficult to find without
exceptional effort and material risk. The user can go to popular
&quot;erotica&quot; sites to fill his screens with photographs of group sex 
scenes, close-up shots of genital mutilation, eroticized defecation 
scenarios, or vulgar videotape stills of
animals with young women.  He can sell these pictures, or swap
them, or send them to disturb a neighbor, or post them to shock
the unwary.  The user can meet inquisitive children in chat rooms
and send them lewd photographs of himself.  He can write detailed
accounts of rape and murder and display them for all to read.
 The user can do these things in near anonymity, and with the
comfort of knowing that he is not at risk of legal sanction. 
This is cyberspace now, and it is the free speech absolutist's
dreamworld.
<p>
Most concede that obscenity -- hard-core sexual material so graphic
and unredeeming that it fails the Supreme Court's test -- should
be illegal on computers as it is elsewhere.  Others balk, however,
at the proposition of laws to keep computer indecency from children.
It is a feigned reaction.  &quot;Indecency&quot; is legal for
adults, but can be regulated so that it is kept from children.
It has been defined as <I>a pattern of patently offensive depictions
or descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs</I>.
The hysterical arguments about indecency laws banning serious
works of literature or library art are no more credible now than
they were when unsuccessfully lobbed at such laws in other contexts.
Society has long embraced the principle that those who peddle
harmful material have the obligation to keep the material from
children.  Moreover, to charge, as some do, that indecency regulation
will bring the developing technology to a screeching halt is to
maintain that its advancement <I>depends upon</I> unfettered
exhibition of offensive sexual material.  This cannot be true.
<p>
Opponents of computer pornography laws say we should simply &quot;empower&quot;
parents instead.  They would empower parents by forcing them to
purchase expensive software products to try to combat the pornographers
themselves.  This is a bad idea for several reasons.  It is bad
philosophically because it advocates <I>restricting</I> the behavior
of the &quot;good guys&quot; (families and children) while giving
license to the &quot;bad guys&quot; to litter cyberspace with
pornography.  It also represents a drastic departure from time-honored
principles of the role of law in protecting children from exploitation.
Outside cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually
explicit images in public places and from selling alcohol, tobacco,
or porn magazines to children.  No one suggests that parents are
absolved from parental responsibility because of these laws. 
Yet, in the cyberporn debate, a small chorus of angry voices bellows:
&quot;It's the responsibility of <I>parents</I>, not government!&quot;
when identical laws are considered.
<p>
It is also a bad idea to leave the burden completely on the parent,
because it will not work.  Without liability and penalty disincentives,
the ability to restrict pornography would depend upon the character
of pornography distributors.  Already there are electronic &quot;how-to&quot;
pamphlets to circumvent blocking devices.  As technical restrictions
increase, so too will these aids, and they will be marketed and
used with impunity.
<p>
We can observe first-hand what the result of a purely market-based,
non-regulatory solution would look like, for we are looking at
it now.  Those advocating technofixes in place of laws aren't
earnestly seeking to empower parents to protect children.  Rather,
they want to force parents by the power of their arrogance to
kick kids off of this universal system so that nothing need inhibit
the free porn trade.
<p>
Opponents of pornography laws implore that the laws simply cannot
apply to this new medium.  This tattered old argument is pulled
out and dusted off with each new technological advance.  We saw
it last in the early '80s with the advent of the commercial videotape
market, and we see it now again.  Scientific change mandates legal
change only insofar as it affects the justification for a law.
The notion that people who disseminate harmful material have
the obligation to restrict the material from children is one which
transcends specific technology.  Old laws might need definition
and renovation, but old principles stand firm. 
<p>
Cyberspace is a work in progress.  We should not squander the
opportunity to examine and appreciate a world where pornography
knows no bounds.  The information superhighway does not belong
to pornographers.  Failure to enact strong laws is a concession
that it should.

<title>AMERICA AND THE SELLING OF PEDOPHILIA</title>

<h2>AMERICA AND THE SELLING OF<br>
PEDOPHILIA</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
Calvin Klein pulled its kiddie porn ads from the market this week,
but not before millions of Americans were treated to a new low
in the ongoing campaign to sexualize children. 
<P>
One ad features a young blonde teen-ager on the floor of a cheaply
furnished room. Her panties are exposed under a short skirt. 
She looks like a kidnap victim, about to be raped.  Her eyes convey
hurt and fear.  Another photo shows a boy clad in purple underpants.
His nails are painted black.  His eyes convey lust.  The ads were
shot by the same photographer that did Madonna's pornographic
book, <U>Sex.</U>
<P>
The television ads are even more suggestive.   In fact, the TV
ads are eerily similar to tapes that were the center of the controversy
last year when the Clinton Justice Department tried to weaken
the definition of child pornography.  In the <I>U.S. v. Knox</I>
case, Janet Reno argued that children had to be completely nude
for material to be considered child pornography, and furthermore,
that the children had to be purposely acting lasciviously.  The
material in <I>Knox</I> was videotapes produced by the Nather
Company, which described them as &quot;erotic beyond belief,&quot;
containing &quot;tender&quot; teens and pre-teens in &quot;savage&quot;
panty shots.  The Nather Tapes were found by the courts to be
child pornography, a verdict agreed to by the U.S. Senate, which
voted 100-0 to  condemn the Reno interpretation.  
<P>
Like the Calvin Klein ads, Nather Tape Two opens with images of
a clothed adolescent girl tentatively striking poses, responding
to off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The camera
repeatedly focuses on her panties.  At one point, she says, &quot;I
don't know what to do.&quot;  The off-camera voice asks her to
sit down and push her knees up.  Another panty shot follows, and
another voice off camera says, &quot;We love it.&quot;  In another
tape, the off-camera voice asks a pre-teen girl to dance as the
camera focuses on parts of her body.  In the Calvin Klein ads,
a teen girl stands nervously in a basement room, responding to
off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The off-camera
voice asks why she's nervous.  She 
replies,  &quot;I don't know what you're going to do.&quot;  The
voice asks her if she's a good dancer.  When she replies that
she is, he asks her to dance for him.  Other ads show a boy in
t-shirt and jeans.  The off-camera voice compliments the boy on
his body, and tells him he looks strong.  The voice then goads
him to prove his strength by ripping his t-shirt open, and the
boy complies.  The similarity between the porn tapes and the Klein
ads is uncanny.        
<P>
Before public pressure forced Klein to shelve the ads, many Americans
watched in dismay, asking how a nation came to allow its children
to be fodder for crude commercials by unscrupulous vendors.  Then
again, some ask, why has America allowed its children to be exposed
to graphic materials in public schools in the name of  &quot;AIDS
prevention&quot; and  &quot;sex education?&quot; 
<P>
The sexualization of children in America had its beginnings not
on a Madison Avenue drawing board or even in Hollywood but in
the pages of one of the best-known (and least-read) books of the
century -- Alfred C. Kinsey's <U>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</U>.  In 1948, Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, shocked
the world with the publication of  what came to be known as the
Kinsey Report.  A companion volume on females was published in
1953.
<P>
Both books ignited a controversy that persists to this day.  Both
paint a picture of people of all ages awash in secret sexual experimentation.
 The Kinsey Reports formed the &quot;scientific&quot; basis of
Hugh Hefner's destructive Playboy Philosophy, which brought pornography,
adultery, pre-marital and homosexual sex into the American mainstream.

<P>
But the most disturbing element of the Kinsey Reports is the overlooked
chapter in the male volume entitled &quot;Early Sexual Growth
and Activity.&quot;   Featuring charts in which &quot;trained
persons&quot; measured incidences of &quot;orgasm&quot; in children
as young as two months, the Kinsey child sex material contains
the seeds of a growing cultural movement to regard children as
not only sexually viable but entitled to sex with adults.  
<P>
In 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman delivered a paper on the Kinsey child
sexuality data at the Fifth World Congress of Sexuality in Jerusalem.
 Nine years later, Dr. Reisman, along with sex therapist Edward
W. Eichel,  research physician Dr. J. Gordon Muir and psychologist
Dr. John Court wrote <U>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination
of a People</U>.   The authors, according to the British medical
journal <I>The Lancet</I>, &quot;demolish the foundations of the
two [Kinsey] reports.&quot;   They also expose the foundation
of the Kinsey philosophy, which views all sexual acts as essentially
equal &quot;outlets.&quot;  To Kinsey, the sex between a husband
and wife is no different morally, physically or socially from
that of  sex between the same genders, between children and adults,
or even between humans and animals.  
<P>
And to Kinsey, age is not much of a factor.  In the Female volume,
he remarks, &quot; It is difficult to understand why a child,
except for its cultural conditioning, should be disturbed at having
its genitalia touched.&quot; 
<P>
 
<P>
Since the Kinsey books remain the most influential works in the
study of sex, their philosophy has spilled over, first to academia,
then to the larger culture.  Kinsey disciples went on to found
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS), which peddles the Kinsey philosophy in its sex education
materials.  In 1980, SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone told the
Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians that SIECUS' primary
mission was to educate society &quot;very broadly and deeply with
awareness of the vital importance of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
 SIECUS President Debra Haffner has even envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which young teens are taught how to
stimulate each other sexually -- without having intercourse. 
With such novel approaches, SIECUS recently snagged a major federal
grant from the Clinton Administration to evaluate all sex education
programs in the United States.  
<P>
In 1991, <I>Child</I> magazine featured an article by then-Kinsey
Institute President June Reinisch called &quot;Sensuality and
Kids.&quot;  Reinisch counsels parents to foster sex play and
masturbation among children because it &quot;develops self-esteem&quot;
and for which some children &quot;use to relax and get ready for
sleep.&quot;  In the same vein, former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders advocated teaching children to masturbate. 
<P>
Other signs that the Kinsey philosophy is destroying cultural
protections for children abound:
<UL>
<LI>The American Psychiatric Association's latest <U>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual</U> has redefined pedophilia so that a
person who molests children is no longer a &quot;pedophile&quot;
unless he feels bad or anxious about what he is doing.   The &quot;stress&quot;
triggered by feeling bad is now considered the marker for a paraphilic
disorder.  So a well-adjusted molester is okay because he feels
okay about what he does.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In <I>The New Republic</I>, the mainstream liberal political
weekly, Hanna Rosin offers a defense of the pro-pedophile North
American Man-Boy Love Association in a recent review of the documentary
film <I>Chickenhawks</I>.  Regarding sex between boys and men,
she asks, &quot;is the idea of mutual consent so absurd?&quot;
 Then she quotes a NAMBLA member who advocates treating children
&quot;in a different way.&quot;  Rosin's comment:  &quot;Certainly
a self-serving view, but still plausibly on the continuum of,
say, a defense of children's legal autonomy.&quot; 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New York Times </I>devoted several pages in its Sunday
magazine last year to Sally Mann's &quot;provocative&quot; nude
photos of her own children.  This week, incidentally, the Times'
fashion supplement includes a MAC Viva Glam lipstick ad with a
spread-legged crotch shot of a leather-stockinged Ru Paul, the
transvestite. The paper still carries this phrase on its banner:
 &quot;All the news that's fit to print.&quot;
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Movies and television increasingly portray children as sexual
actors.  In the 1994 film <I>Milk Money</I>, for example, young
boys watch and sell pornographic videos and pool their milk money
to buy the services of a prostitute.  In the film <I>Blank Check</I>,
a preadolescent boy schemes to have sex with a woman twice his
age. A Disney affiliate, Miramax,  has released an NC-17 film,
<I>Kids</I>, which shows young teens indulging in indiscriminate
sex and drug-taking.  The film's makers frankly admit that their
work is perverse, and that its gritty tone might offend some people.
 Precisely.  And have you noticed how often young children now
emit vulgarities and obscenities, even in &quot;family films?&quot;
</UL>
<P>
As for Calvin Klein, the designer rebukes the charges against
his filthy ads, saying that he was not intending a pornographic
message.  Klein says that &quot;some people are taking away a
different perception&quot; of the ads than the &quot;intended
message.&quot;   Coming from the man who began high-fashion kiddie
porn back in 1980 when he had 15-year-old Brooke Shields say suggestively
that &quot;nothing&quot; came between her and her Calvins, this
does not pass the straight face test.  He is lying, or is so personally
corrupt that he is unable to recognize the depravity of his own
message.  In a full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, Klein
defended the ads, describing their &quot;positive message&quot;
as &quot;that young people today, the most media savvy generation
yet, have a real strength of character and independence.  They
have very strongly defined lines of what they will and will not
do -- and have a great ability to know who they are and who they
want to be.&quot;  Pretty rhetoric, and very similar to that employed
 by the North American Man-Boy Love Association, which contends
that children ought to be &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;make
their own decisions&quot; about having sex with adults.  The nice
men at NAMBLA want to &quot;empower&quot; children.  Talk about
&quot;the Hurried Child.&quot;   The child-sex movement is all
too eager to &quot;free&quot; children from the constraints of
their parents' morality.
<P>
Certain features of the Klein photo ads scream of child pornography.
 The off-color carpet and wood paneling suggest a basement room
-- child molesters often use the seclusion and privacy of a basement
to photograph their victims.  The blonde girl in the ad has a
frightened look on her face, and her hand is raised to her mouth,
where her lips appear slightly blue.  When children are sodomized,
they are often left bruised. 
<P>
Between Alfred Kinsey, Calvin Klein, and their disciples in Hollywood,
the entire nation is getting bruised -- beginning with our children.

<title>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN BEIJING CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN<br>
BEIJING CONFERENCE<br>
SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
Within hours of Harry Wu's safe return to the United States, the
Clinton Administration announced First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
intention to go to Beijing for the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women.  After weeks of debate and uncertainty regarding
her participation, the Clintons felt Harry Wu's release paved
the way for the First Lady to attend without further barriers.
 But the Clintons are mistaken:  there remain several significant
reasons why Mrs. Clinton should not attend this conference.
<P>
First, Harry Wu was shamelessly used by the Chinese government
as a bargaining chip.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration
bought into China's tactic 100 percent.  By &quot;rewarding&quot;
China for its &quot;good&quot; behavior of expelling human rights
activist Harry Wu after convicting him of &quot;crimes,&quot;
the United States demonstrates that despotic regimes like China
should be free to take and use political prisoners as leverage
to strongarm the U.S. into accommodating their wishes.  The U.S.
position in this sends a clear message to China and to other nations
that the U.S. is willing to abide by the perverse rules of extortion.
<P>
Secondly, the Clinton Administration wrongly assumes that Harry
Wu's return to the United States clears the way for the First
Lady to attend the conference by exonerating China.  It does not.
 Indeed, during his first speech to the public after returning
from China, Mr. Wu strongly urged Mrs. Clinton to forgo her participation
in the Beijing conference because of China's blatant disregard
for human rights.  Mr. Wu said that the First Lady's attendance
would send China &quot;a signal, a kind of approval&quot; that
the United States is willing to tolerate, even condone, such crimes
against humanity.
<P>
And human rights abuses in China abound.  From forced sterilization
and coercive abortion policies, to female infanticide, to slave
labor (which Harry Wu placed himself at considerable risk to document),
to the killing of prisoners to harvest their organs for transplant
procedures, to cannibalizing aborted fetuses, to religious persecution,
to the quashing of human rights at all levels by the ruthless
communist Chinese government, the Chinese people inhumanely suffer
at the hands of their own government.  Indeed, the only difference
between the Tiananmen Square massacre and the ghastly human 
rights abuses that occur every day in China is that Tiananmen
was witnessed by the public.
<P>
Perhaps because the Tiananmen massacre has been permanently etched
into America's consciousness, the public outcry against Mrs. Clinton's
attendance in Beijing has been strong and swift.  As a result,
the Clinton Administration has been prompted to defend Mrs. Clinton's
attendance by contending that she will be able to:  (1) speak
out against China's human rights violations and (2) advance women's
rights.  However, it is doubtful that the First Lady will be able
to accomplish either of these objectives by participating in this
conference.
<P>
First, while we earnestly hope that Mrs. Clinton will highlight
China's human rights abuses, it is also noteworthy that Geraldine
Ferraro, a Clinton Administration-appointed delegate to the United
Nations conference, requested that the Beijing document's condemnation
of  &quot;trafficking in human organs and tissue&quot; -- a barbaric
practice largely associated with China -- remain bracketed for
removal.  In other words, Ms. Ferraro blocked this language from
being officially incorporated into the document.  That an official
U.S. delegate was unwilling to have the conference document even
<I>mention</I> one of China's most egregious human rights violations
during an unpublicized consultatory meeting makes it that much
more improbable that the First Lady would dare to condemn China's
abuses in the highly publicized setting of Beijing. 
<P>
Furthermore, a great chasm exists between doing something about
human rights abuses and merely talking about them.  A strong stand
by the Clinton Administration to withhold the First Lady's attendance
on the grounds that China abuses women would have shown words
backed by action.  But now the Administration has only words.
 And if the adage is true that actions speak louder than words,
then Mrs. Clinton's words will have little impact since she is
in Beijing delivering them.  Worst of all, her distinguished presence
at the conference confers on China the international spotlight
it desires and the legitimacy it seeks.
<P>
Finally, if the First Lady intends to uphold women's rights, then
she should not be attending the Beijing conference at all.  The
Beijing document's Platform for Action does not represent the
large majority of American women (or the women of any other country,
for that matter) on the central issues of motherhood and the family.
 Rather, it promotes a radical feminist agenda which undermines
the natural family unit and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life, while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
From the beginning of Harry Wu's imprisonment, the Clinton Administration
has been adamant in its resolve to send a  U.S. delegation to
the Beijing conference.  The U.S. refused to take a firm stand
then.  But with Wu's release, it would have been only a small
price to pay for the U.S. to finally take a stand -- albeit symbolic
-- by having Mrs. Clinton refuse to attend the conference.  That
the Clinton Administration failed to do even that is disturbing.

<title>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES:<br>
GET A PROMISE KEEPER TO<br>
HELP DO DISHES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
Forget the Enjoli Woman.  The delegates to the UN's Fourth World
Conference on Women taking place in Beijing, China aren't interested
in proving that they &quot;can bring home the bacon <I>and</I>
fry it up in a pan.&quot;
<P>
According to Grete Berget, who heads the Norwegian delegation,
the conferees are interested instead in finding effective ways
to &quot;get men to share working at home.&quot;
<P>
I've got a little tip for Ms. Berget and other delegates looking
for men willing to help with the vacuuming and the dishes:  go
to church.
<P>
Now, that may sound like strange advice.  And it's probably not
the kind of hint most Beijing delegates would consider helpful.
<P>
But a recent study by sociologist Gary Hansen at the University
of Kentucky found that the men most apt to help their wives with
household chores are orthodox Christians.
<P>
That's right, men who strongly believe the Bible is &quot;God's
word&quot; and &quot;the answer to all important human problems&quot;
spend more time than other men doing household chores like cooking,
cleaning, and dishwashing.
<P>
Lest anyone get the wrong impression, these Christians do not
believe in gender blending.  In fact, Hansen reports they are
more likely than others to support traditional breadwinner-homemaker
arrangements and to believe young children suffer when Mom is
employed outside the home.
<P>
Yet, orthodox Christian men aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves
and help out around the house.  According to Hansen, they devote
more time to household chores than do less-orthodox and non-orthodox
men.  
<P>
That the women who get the most help around the house are married
to men who attend churches that extol the virtues of male leadership
seems rather surprising.  
Surprising, that is, until one considers that the Bible instructs
men to mimic the leadership style of the One who said He came
&quot;not to be served, but to serve.&quot;  And who proved it
by doing things like washing others' dirty feet.
<P>
Challenging men to be &quot;servant leaders&quot; is one of the
main purposes of Promise Keepers, a Christian men's organization
which has hosted a series of stadium-packed conferences this summer
that have attracted more than 600,000 male attendees.  Several
of these gatherings have been picketed by activists from the National
Organization for Women (NOW) -- a fact which David Blankenhorn
of the Institute for American Values finds curious.
<P>
&quot;The more I listen to Promise Keepers' message -- that men
should be faithful to their wives and involved in their children's
lives and willing to express emotion and quick to admit mistakes
-- the more I hear the echoes of those frustrated housewives who
gave 1960s feminism much of its animating spirit,&quot; he says.
<P>
This is not to say that Promise Keepers is singing from one of
Betty Freidan's old song sheets.  But it is to say that their
tune is at least similar enough that 1990s women tired of coming
home from work to loads of laundry ought to at least give a listen.
<P>
Indeed, Hansen's research findings bring to mind the mid-1980s
song by the B-52s in which Kate Pierson expresses longings for
&quot;someone who's <I>heaven sent</I>, someone to help pay rent,
someone to share dreams and wishes, someone to help me do the
dishes.&quot;       
<P>
It is possible that the delegates in Beijing will stumble across
new ways to make men more sensitive to women's needs.  But it
isn't likely.  
<P>
Tensions between the sexes -- and disputes about housework --
date back to, well, Biblical times.  And throughout history, the
only way these tensions and disputes have been eased consistently
is to challenge members of both sexes to lay aside scorekeeping
and serve one another.
<P>
Grete Berget and the other delegates attending the Beijing conference
are right when they say that many men today are failing to serve
their wives.  But if the University of Kentucky study is any indication,
the answer to this problem is less likely to come from the UN
conference in Beijing than from the Promise Keeper rallies sweeping
America. 
<P>
Praise the Lord and pass the Palmolive.

<title>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</title>

<h2>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>
<p>
As little Johnny or Joanie adjust to the reality of another school
year, they might find that it is a little bit tough to concentrate
on academics.
<p>
How, indeed, can children keep their mind on arithmetic when they
are exposed to sex in a big way?  From kindergarten on, many children
are learning the ABC's of sexuality, taught in a &quot;morally
neutral&quot; manner in state-mandated programs.
<p>
Despite two decades of documented failure to reduce the ravages
of teen sex, the effort to sexualize children at younger and younger
ages continues apace.  The rationale used to be &quot;sexual health&quot;
or reproductive safety.  Now, the same bad medicine is being peddled
under the rubric of  &quot;AIDS prevention.&quot;  Each year,
it gets earlier, more graphic, and increasingly incorporates &quot;alternative
lifestyles.&quot;
<p>
Parents are being cut out of the act.  In Falmouth, Massachusetts,
a court ruled recently that schools could pass out condoms even
if parents object.  In school libraries, books like <i>Heather
Has Two Mommies</i> are taking their place alongside Dr. Seuss.
 Parents who object are called &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;religious
fanatics.&quot;
<p>
Why did much of America's educational establishment buy into the
notion that children should be taught about sex years before puberty?
 Part of the answer can be found in Indiana, at the world-famous
Kinsey Institute.  It was here, in the late 1940s, that Dr. Alfred
C. Kinsey published his famous Kinsey Report, formally known as
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>.  As revealed by Dr.
Judith A. Reisman in a 1981 paper, and further explored in the
1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>, by Dr. Reisman, Edward
W. Eichel, Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. John H. Court, the Kinsey
material contains a chapter on child sexuality that has been the
basis for the view that children are sexually viable at all ages.
<p>
Graph tables (Tables 31 and 34) report data that can have been
gathered only during the sexual molestation of children from two months
to 15 years of age with climaxes recorded by the use of a &quot;second
hand or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
In one instance, a four-year-old boy was said to have had 26 &quot;orgasms&quot;
in a 24-hour period.  Because molestation of children is illegal,
the Kinsey studies have been the only data on child sexuality
to achieve wide usage.
<p>
Efforts to open the Kinsey files on the child sex experiments
have been rebuffed by current director John Bancroft as well as
his predecessors.  How did Kinsey get this data?  Where did the
children come from?  Are their identities known today?  Who committed
these acts?  These questions remain unanswered.
<p>
Incredibly, even as the rest of the Kinsey Report became the touchstone
of the sexual revolution, the child data has largely been ignored
by the popular culture -- even though it may have had the most
far-reaching effect on academic views about child sexuality.
<p>
The Kinsey view of child sexuality, although based on criminal
abuse of children, has been promoted for years through major sex
education institutions to which Kinsey's disciples migrated. 
Taxpayers are being forced to fund the Kinseyan agenda through
federal grants to the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), which was founded by Kinsey colleagues
and disciples.
<p>
SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned
Parenthood, has said that the SIECUS mission is to educate society
&quot;very broadly and deeply with awareness of the vital importance
of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
<p>
Current SIECUS President Debra Haffner has envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which youngsters are taught to strip
and masturbate each other and to engage in &quot;outercourse&quot;
as a way to forestall intercourse.  This view was echoed by former
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who on the advice of SIECUS counselors,
advocated teaching children how to masturbate.
<p>
But educators are not the only intended carrier of the Kinsey
gospel.  In its blueprint document, <I>Sex Education 2000</I>,
SIECUS &quot;calls on the national media to present sexuality
as a positive aspect of the total human experience <I>at all stages
of the life cycle</I>&quot; (emphasis mine).
<p>
Apparently, Calvin Klein got the message, judging by its recent
kiddie-porn style ad campaign for jeans.  The print and TV ads
show young teens in various states of undress with camera angles
and settings that evoke classic themes of child pornography. 
Klein's defense of the lascivious commercials was vintage Kinsey/SIECUS.
In a  full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, the designer
called the campaign &quot;positive&quot; because the ads convey
the idea that &quot;young people today...have a real strength
of character and independence.&quot;  Translated: You are great,
kid.  Only <I>you</I> know what is right.  Now strip for the camera.
Then get back to class.  You've still got a lot to learn.
<p>
It is time for the Kinsey Institute to open its file and solve
a 50-year-old cover-up that is still having a profound effect
on our culture.  And it is time to curb the ongoing crusade in
education and popular culture to rob our children of an irreplaceable
treasure -- their innocence.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>PARENTAL RIGHTS:</br>
WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
Congress will soon take up legislation designed to acknowledge
(or restore) the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children.  Is federal legislation really necessary?
 Consider the following:  This summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon Earls
of Toccoa, Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year-old daughters' room.  The girls confessed that
their middle school counselor had helped them get the condoms.
After repeatedly being told that it was none of the parent's business,
a reluctant school superintendent revealed to the Earls that the
counselor had driven the girls during school hours to a health
clinic where they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and
given condoms and prescriptions for birth control pills.  The
school has, to date,  refused to give the Earls the results of
the tests.  &quot;We're simply trying to do what's best for the
students,&quot; said the superintendent.  The Earls have filed
a lawsuit against the school and its officials. Georgia taxpayers
are funding the school's defense, and its attorneys have moved
the case to federal court.
<p>
Education bureaucrats are not the only culprits.  A steady drumbeat
of Child Protective Services tragedies reveals an increasing nonchalance
about the sanctity of the family unit on the part of government
social workers who take children from their homes on little more
than rumor.  This &quot;loot first and ask questions later&quot;
approach reflects the height of arrogance, and does untold damage
to the very souls CPS was designed to protect.  Tragically, however,
there are real cases of intra-family abuse and neglect.  But in
too many such cases, protective government agencies completely
fail to intervene.   That our child protection system needs improvement
is apparent, but no case of under-enforcement can support a blanket
sanction of over-enforcement so obtrusive as to be self-defeating.
<p>
To compound matters, President Clinton earlier this year agreed
to the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child,
which espouses the &quot;new concept&quot; of government &quot;protecting
children from the power of parents.&quot;  There is little doubt that the 
United Nations is out of touch with American ideas.  The U.N.'s Convention on
the Rights of the Child was telling, but the platform document
for its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- with its
confusion about gender and hostility toward motherhood and natural
families -- cinches the case.  The UN has been virtually co-opted
by social experimentalists who can test theories in an ostensibly
reputable body where physical and conceptual &quot;foreign-ness&quot;
makes for reduced scrutiny and no real accountability.  Paternal
deconstruction proponents responsible for the Convention on the
Rights of the Child have accomplished through the U.N. what they
could not through the legislative process.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley and Congressman Steve Largent have introduced
the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.  The Act
establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and provide
for the education and religious teaching of their children, and
also addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline.
 Importantly, the Act allows the government to intervene when
it has a compelling interest to do so, and has specific allowances
for child abuse and neglect.  
<p>
The notion that government should protect children from the power
of parents is opposed by the vast majority of Americans.  In February
of this year, Luntz Research asked registered voters nationwide:
&quot;Who do you feel should be primarily responsible for the
upbringing and education of children -- parents or the government?&quot;
 Voters favored parents by a landslide 94%.
<p>
The Earls will continue to fight for the right to be parents,
and pro-family groups will rally around the much-needed Parental
Rights Act.  Stable, intact families rearing children with both
love and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed.  The time has come to put a stop to efforts to replace
Mom and Dad with Big Brother.

<title>STAY MARRIED, GO TO CHURCH, LIVE LONGER. NO SWEAT.</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>STAY MARRIED,<br>
GO TO CHURCH,<br>
LIVE LONGER. NO SWEAT.</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
If you want to live longer, lose weight.  So says a widely-publicized
study recently published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>.
<p>
But there's actually another, more effective way to help increase
your own, your spouse's, and your <I>children's</I> longevity,
without the sweat or the bland food.  It's staying married.
<p>
According to a 70-year prospective study recently reported in
the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> and the <I>American
Psychologist</I>, either the breakup of one's own marriage or
the divorce of one's parents reduced the average life span of
a group of 1,500 gifted children studied throughout their lifetimes.
<p>
That's right.  Divorce may be hazardous to your health.  Men and
women who at some point in time went through a divorce, even if
they remarried, had a 40 percent greater risk of premature death
than those who were steadily married.  Those who did not remarry
fared even worse.  Men who remained divorced or separated were
120 percent more likely to face earlier death.  Among women, the
risk jumped 80 percent.
<p>
Dr. David B. Larson, president of the National Institute for Healthcare
Research (NIHR) in Rockville, MD, recently released an extensive
research report that further details the impact of divorce on
health.  Among other findings, Dr. Larson found that divorced
people were more likely to be afflicted with terminal cancer,
three times more likely to commit suicide, and among men, twice
as likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease than
their married counterparts.  In fact, divorced men who didn't
smoke had only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than
married men who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
While the threat of premature mortality might not weigh heavily
in the minds of couples who are seeking a divorce, the startling news
that their divorce might shorten the lives of their <I>children</I>
may give reason for pause.  The <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> study found that when parental divorce occurred before
the children reached age 21, the children's risk of mortality
increased by 44 percent.  Moreover, children whose parents divorced
were more likely to experience marital breakup themselves.  But
even after controlling for the dissolution of one's own marriage,
parental divorce during one's childhood was still a significant
predictor of premature mortality.  Perhaps the once oft-quoted
advice of staying together &quot;for the children's sake&quot;
should be heeded more seriously.
<p>
Interestingly, the negative outcomes associated with growing up
in a broken home can be offset by religious faith.  Dr. Larson
of NIHR found that religious commitment not only decreases the
likelihood of divorce, but it also predicts greater satisfaction
in marriage.  Furthermore, several other studies have confirmed
the positive relationship between religious commitment and increased
longevity.
<p>
A study of an elderly population published in the <I>American
Journal of Epidemiology</I> found that the less religious had
mortality levels twice as high as those of the more religious
-- even after controlling for age, marital status, education,
race, gender, the person's health, and previous hospitalizations.
 Moreover, according to a 10-year follow-up of 2,700 persons in
another epidemiological health study, increased church attendance
was the only social factor that effectively decreased mortality
rates in women.
<p>
While divorce is clearly a major public health issue, deterring
divorce is admittedly a hard thing to do.  But it's far from impossible.
 After all, weight loss is a hard sell, too.  And yet, Americans
everywhere will put down their Big Macs, call Weight Watchers,
and join a health club so that they can lose weight and live longer.
<p>
Who knows?  A whole new market to promote marriage might burgeon.
 TV shows could portray more married couples and fewer divorces;
marriage counselors could advertise themselves as marriage <I>and</I>
life savers; warning labels could even be adhered to marriage
certificates reading, &quot;Breaking this covenant may be hazardous
to your health.&quot;  If nothing else, these findings do give
new meaning to the term &quot;life-long&quot; marriage.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP IN CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP<br>
IN CONFERENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
As the conference committee convenes to resolve differences between
the House and Senate welfare bills, the defining issue will be
the family cap.
<p>
A modest first step, if passed by the Congress, the cap would
simply deny a federally-funded increase in the cash benefits to
mothers who bear additional children while on welfare.  A federally-imposed
cap places no restriction on Medicaid, food stamps, and housing
-- or the use of state funds.  States are fully free to fund additional
cash benefits with state money.  Indeed, states are free to use
federal block grant money to fund vouchers for goods and services,
just so long as they freeze the dollar amount of the AFDC check.
 This &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion to the scale
of devastation wrought by illegitimacy's open-ended draw on the
Treasury.
<p>
In many instances, added cash benefits have reduced the birth
father to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem less hallowed, less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  Lowering
our expectations of a woman on welfare and the father of her child
is no different from lowering our estimation of their capability
-- implying that they are a different, less human sort than the
rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Government policy that dumbs down the standards for welfare recipients
so that &quot;measuring up&quot; no longer has any content, or
makes any economic sense, is unjust.  Women on welfare should
have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for centuries
has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What Edmund
Burke wrote long ago is truer today: &quot;We know that we have
made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be
made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare system that makes it 
harder for men and women to pursue virtuous living.
<p>
The argument for the family cap rests not on value premises alone,
but on certain assumptions about human nature and social causation
that are empirically verifiable.  And the most recent data from
New Jersey's experiment with the family cap provides evidence
that proponents of the cap are indeed correct in their assumptions.
<p>
The formal evaluation study at Rutgers University has found no
significant difference in the rate of births to women in the 
&quot;experimental&quot; group, who are subject to the restriction on 
additional cash benefits, and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who 
are exempt from the cash limitation.
<p>
Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the experimental
and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap has had no
impact on births to welfare mothers.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the cap's success is that the
change in policy sent a clear moral signal that was at least as
important an aspect of the policy as the actual restriction on
cash benefits.  Public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, thus triggering the observed decline in births.
<p>
Critics of the cap may question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support for the alternative at the same time.  A public relations
campaign is not sufficient precisely because welfare obviates
the need for personal responsibility.
<p>
If the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating right living.
 Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of the character-forming
institutions -- the families, schools, and churches -- by negating
their functions.
<p>
Conferees who vote against the cap will squander a golden opportunity
to begin replenishing our nation's moral capital, one heart at
a time.

<title>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR COMBATTING 
ILLEGITIMACY</title>
<body>

<h2>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS<br>
STRONG SUPPORT FOR<br>
COMBATTING ILLEGITIMACY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>

<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of
wedlock,&quot; according to a new national poll commissioned by
the Family Research Council.
<p>
Two-thirds (66 percent) of the 1,000 Americans surveyed said they
&quot;strongly&quot; oppose such increases.  Another 18 percent
said they &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare benefit increases
for illegitimacy.  Only 13 percent said these increases were justified.
<p>
These findings should allay any doubts Congressional Republicans
may have about whether the public supports their &quot;family
cap&quot; proposal to cease welfare benefit increases when women
bear additional children out of wedlock.  The &quot;family cap&quot;
is a central feature of the welfare reform legislation House and
Senate GOP leaders will be sending soon to the President.
<p>
Interestingly, support for the family cap among rank-and-file
pro-lifers is at least as strong as support from other Americans.
 Among those who &quot;strongly&quot; favor prohibitions against
abortion, 70 percent &quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap,
and another 16 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; support such an approach.
 (Some pro-life leaders have expressed concern that the &quot;family
cap&quot; might increase abortions, while others have argued that
curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancy will lower the number of abortions
long term since most abortions are to unmarried women.)
<p>
The FRC poll also found that Americans are more hopeful about
efforts to combat illegitimacy than about &quot;workfare&quot;
strategies.
<p>
By a margin of roughly two-to-one (64 percent to 33 percent),
Americans say &quot;getting young people to delay having children
until they are able to support themselves and a family&quot; is a more 
attainable goal than &quot;getting single mothers with few job skills into 
jobs that will pay them enough to support themselves and their children.&quot;
<p>
This does not mean Americans oppose workfare.  In fact, fully
90 percent say welfare recipients should have to work for their
benefits.
<p>
But the poll results do suggest that Americans expect policymakers
to give at least as much attention to a preventative, anti-illegitimacy
strategy as they do to a remedial, workfare strategy.
<p>
And should there not be enough &quot;workfare&quot; jobs to go
around, most Americans believe welfare mothers of preschool children
should be permitted to go to the back of the line.
<p>
Eighty-two percent say preschool moms should be the &quot;last&quot;
group required to work for benefits.  Most say &quot;mothers of
school-aged children&quot; and (especially) &quot;fathers of dependent
children&quot; should have to meet work requirements first.
<p>
These findings suggest that significant increases in day care
spending are not needed to complement &quot;workfare&quot; requirements,
since neither House would require states to provide jobs for all
welfare recipients.
<p>
The FRC poll was conducted in mid-October by Voter/Consumer Research,
a research firm based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The poll surveyed
1,000 randomly-selected Americans.  It has a margin for error
of plus or minus three percent.

<title>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
As the welfare reform debate turns increasingly to the states,
a number of folks interested in finding effective ways to combat
illegitimacy have been intrigued by something going on deep in
the heart of Texas.  Apparently, when it comes to having babies,
women seldom go it alone in the Lone Star State.
<p>
Whereas nearly one in three babies (31 percent) nationally is
born to a single mother, the most recent data available from the
National Center for Health Statistics show that roughly one in
six Texas tots (17 percent) is born out of wedlock.  Only Utah
(15 percent) has a lower ratio of non-marital to marital births.
<p>
What is remarkable -- and somewhat curious -- about the Lone Star
State's relatively low illegitimacy ratio is that it runs counter
to nearly every major national trend.  Generally, illegitimacy
tends to be higher in states with populations that are disproportionately
young, poor, or black -- all of which are true of Texas.
<p>
Indeed, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the District of
Columbia have the nation's highest illegitimacy ratios, while
Idaho, New Hampshire, and North Dakota follow Utah and Texas in
the Top Five for low illegitimacy.
<p>
So what explains the Lone Star State's apparent success?  Why
is Texas the only state along America's southern border that has
an illegitimacy ratio below the national average?
<p>
No one knows for sure.  But those hoping that Texas has found
some magic bullet for dramatically reducing our nation's serious
illegitimacy problem are apt to be disappointed.
<p>
Here's why:  NCHS shows that while Texas has a non-marital birth
rate well below the national average, it also has a teen pregnancy
rate well above the national average.  In fact, 45 states have a lower teen
pregnancy rate than Texas.  Thus, the Lone Star State's low illegitimacy
ratio apparently is not due to the success of its teen pregnancy
prevention programs.  Nor is it apparently attributable to rampant
abortion, since the abortion rate in Texas is below the national
average.
<p>
How, then, does one explain the fact that the Lone Star State
simultaneously has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in
the country and one of the lowest illegitimacy ratios?  Here are
three possible explanations:
<p>
<b>1. The Shotgun Marriage Theory</b>. It used to be that girls
who got pregnant out of wedlock would, with the aid of their enraged
fathers, convince their boyfriends to marry them prior to the
arrival of their child.  Thus, many out-of-wedlock pregnancies
ended up being in-wedlock births.
<p>
In recent years, of course, shotgun marriages have fallen out
of fashion.  And while NCHS does not have data comparing the age
of first marriage for Texas women to that of women from other
states, there is little reason to believe shotgun marriages are
making a major comeback in Texas -- even though the Lone Star
State does have a disproportionate number of shotgun owners.
<p>
<b>2. The Chevy Suburban Theory</b>.  Not only does Texas have
more shotgun owners than other states, but it also has more of
those gas-guzzling, road-hogging Chevy Suburbans that some like
to call &quot;Texas Station Wagons.&quot;  Why is this important?
 Because nine-passenger Chevy Suburbans are the ultimate Big Family
Car for married couples who have lots of children -- and when
marrieds have lots of children, the ratio of non-marital to marital
births is lowered.
<p>
Indeed, the reason Utah has the lowest illegitimacy ratio in the
country is not just because its highly-Mormon unmarried population
is less likely to engage in the kind of hanky-panky that leads
to early pregnancy.  It is also because its highly-Mormon married
population is very reproductive by today's standards.
<p>
The most recent stats from the Census Bureau show that Texas women
are bearing children at a rate well below that of Utah women.
 But these stats are several years old, so it is at least conceivable
that Texas couples have recently started reproducing like rabbits
to fill their Suburbans.  It is more likely, of course, that many
Texas families are driving those gas-guzzling Suburbans (instead
of more practical seven-passenger minivans) because a good Texan
would never own a &quot;mini&quot; anything.
<p>
<b>3. The Texans Tell Tall Tales Theory</b>.  Another possibility
is that Texas' illegitimacy numbers are illegitimate -- that the
Lone Star State's data reflect that time-tested Texas tendency
to tell tall tales.  Sad to say, one need not hail from the &quot;Show
Me State&quot; (Missouri) to be skeptical about the veracity of
Texas' numbers.  The reason?  NCHS reports that Texas is one of
six states that does not require a mother's marital status to
be identified on her child's birth certificate.
<p>
Thus, NCHS says the illegitimacy numbers Texas reports to NCHS
are &quot;inferred.&quot;  This is a fancy way of saying the numbers
are made up.  They are educated guesses, to be sure.  By educated
people no doubt.  But they are, in the end, still guesses.
<p>
Curiously, Texas leaped from 23rd in the nation in low teen illegitimacy
in 1989 to 9th nationally in 1990 -- the very year Texas made
it easier for births to be &quot;inferred&quot; as marital.  Thus,
Texas' dramatic &quot;improvement&quot; in illegitimacy in recent
years is almost surely due to the fact that Texas officials have
been &quot;inferring&quot; lots of births incorrectly.
<p>
To their credit, some straight-shooters at the Texas Bureau of
Vital Statistics recently changed the procedure for reporting
birth information so that a mother's marital status must be identified.
 The effects of this change won't be reported by NCHS until next
spring, but preliminary indications are that Texas' illegitimacy
ratio will climb to about 29 percent.
<p>
That is significantly higher than the Lone Star State's current
ratio, but it is still lower than the national average -- and
lower than all of its neighbors.
<p>
Which is to say Texas probably doesn't have a magic bullet in
its fight against illegitimacy, but it does have an illegitimacy
ratio just good enough to give Texans reason to do what Texans
do best: boast.

<title>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT BLACKS FAVOR GETTING TOUGH ON 
CRIMINALS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT<br>
BLACKS FAVOR GETTING<br>
TOUGH ON CRIMINALS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Whites often blame blacks for the crime problem, and some believe
blacks have no interest in getting tough on criminals.  But new
evidence shows that the black community is very interested in
fighting crime.  After all, they are the most frequent  crime
victims, their sons go to jail more often, and they suffer most
from drug-related crime.
<p>
A new national poll sponsored by the Family Research Council found
that blacks favor get-tough policies on crime, including forcing
prisoners to work, requiring them to pay restitution, and ensuring
they are drug-free before release.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS OF WORK FOR PRISONERS</h3></center>
<p>
More than eight in 10 black Americans told Voter/Consumer Research
(a Maryland-based national pollster commissioned by FRC to do
this study) that they favor requiring convicted criminals to work
while serving their sentences.  They share the commonly held view
that prison should be punishment and not a health resort for body
building.
<p>
Apparently, black citizens sense that requiring work while in
jail improves the chances that some inmates will turn away from
crime once released.
<p>
Although most Americans favor requiring criminals to work, only
9 percent of America's inmates are employed while serving time
and few inmates actually do obtain jobs.  Nonetheless, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons found that inmates who enrolled in industrial
work were substantially less likely to cause disciplinary problems in 
prison or be rearrested after release.  Similarly, research by Anne 
Piehl of Harvard University found that prisoners enrolled in high school 
classes were 10 percent less likely to be rearrested four years after
their release than those who did not participate.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS FOR VICTIMS</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC survey also found that more than three out of every four
black Americans favor requiring convicted criminals to pay their
victims and their victims' families financial compensation for
the pain, suffering and economic hardship they caused.  Those
most apt to support restitution are single women and divorced
and single parents.
<p>
The women who favor restitution are in one of the most victimized
groups in America.  According to the Justice Department, the violence
victimization rates for single and divorced women are four times
greater than for married women.  Many black females find themselves
very vulnerable to crime and understandably are outspoken about
victim restitution.
<p>
But for inmates, earning money to make restitution payments to
victims can be difficult.  More might be willing to work, but
many jurisdictions have laws that do not permit prison factories
to make products that compete with the private sector.   Understandably,
law-abiding citizens often object to giving up jobs so felons
can be employed.   Some prison systems have found a way, however.
<p>
In Lockhart, Texas, 138 inmates make computer circuit boards,
eyeglasses and air conditioners.  Prisoners put their names on
waiting lists to get jobs and agree to have most of their wages
deducted to help offset the $21,000 per year cost of their incarceration
as well as to support a victims compensation fund.
<p>
Although recovering some of the billions spent on prisons is a
worthy objective, most taxpayers are not willing to sacrifice
public safety to save money.  There are alternatives to incarceration
for non-violent offenders, however.
<p>
In 1992, one-third of new prison inmates were drug offenders.
 All violent drug criminals belong behind bars.  But many were
non-violent, low level drug offenders.  For them, punishment could
include public service with frequent drug testing to ensure they
stay drug-free.  This would save prison space for the truly violent
criminals and save taxpayer dollars.
<p>
<center><h3>DRUG-TESTING MAKES SENSE</h3></center>
<p>
Black Americans know that drug abuse and crime are linked.  FRC's
survey found that 85 percent of blacks favor drug testing to insure that 
a criminal is drug-free prior to release.  In addition, more than three of 
every four blacks oppose drug legalization.
<p>
The Justice Department found that half of all state prison inmates
have used cocaine and half used some drugs during the month prior
to their current offense.  Thirty-one percent of inmates admitted
they were using drugs at the time of the offense.  Black and white
inmates are equally likely to have used a drug in the month before
their current offense.
<p>
The Justice Department's 1994 crime &quot;Sourcebook&quot; profiles
a study that drug tested arrestees in 23 cities.  Based on voluntary
and anonymous urine samples and interviews, the study found that
81 percent of men arrested in Chicago and 83 percent of women
in Manhattan, New York tested positive for drugs.  The lowest
numbers, although still remarkable, were found in Omaha, Nebraska
(54 percent) and San Antonio, Texas (42 percent).
<p>
Black Americans want law enforcement agencies to wage the drug
war vigorously and curb crime.  Lawmakers must heed the message
of the FRC's recent survey.  Laws that mandate work serve to both
punish and save criminals; restitution helps crime victims; requiring
drug-testing reduces the likelihood of criminals returning to
prey on more victims.

<title>PARENTS WANT HELP FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S ADVERSE INFLUENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>PARENTS WANT HELP<br>
FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S<br>
ADVERSE INFLUENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Most parents applauded when Procter &amp; Gamble recently withdrew
all advertising from four popular talk shows because they feature
&quot;gratuitous sex, foul language, and references to violence.&quot;
 Apparently, P&amp;G now understands that consumers are convinced
that these shows represent the decay of pop culture.
<p>
According to an October 1995 national public opinion survey commissioned
by the Family Research Council, four of every five parents believe
pop culture negatively affects children.  Single parents, especially,
say they need outside help shielding their children from pop culture's
emphasis on sex, violence, and vulgarity.
<p>
Even when Generation Xers (age 18 to 30) were asked &quot;to assess
the degree to which today's movies, television, and music lyrics
encourage teenage sex&quot;, 63 percent said &quot;a great deal&quot;
or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Programs like <I>Melrose Place</I>
and <I>Beverly Hills, 90210</I> flaunt sexual themes and vulgarity
and even family-hour shows such as <I>The Nanny</I> are laden
with sexual innuendo.
<p>
Three of every four Americans told Voter/Consumer Research (a
Maryland-based national pollster) that they either strongly or
somewhat agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my own views.&quot;  This widely shared view might explain Proctor
&amp; Gamble's move to dump trash talk shows.
<p>
Parents intuitively know what the scientific community confirms:
the messages of pop culture are &quot;persuasive&quot; in affecting
behavior.
<p>
In 1995, Robert McAfee, president of the American Medical Association,
stated: &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures, rap
music and video games, there's a continuing influence of violence....[and]
violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;  More than half of
young adults told FRC they agree that &quot;movies, television
and music lyrics contribute to violent crimes.&quot;
<p>
The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness.  Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot; 
<p>
Science isn't as conclusive regarding television's impact on drug
abuse and teen sex, although the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia recently released a national survey showing
that 76 percent of adolescents blame popular culture for encouraging
illegal drug use.
<p>
Researchers have found that <I>MTV</I>, the marriage between television
and music, is especially corrosive.  According to the authors
of the book <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, music television is &quot;one
of the most powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;
<p>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music
affects behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes, our
emotions, and our behavior.&quot;  It is estimated that the average
teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.
<p>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.
<p>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[p]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;
<p>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child</I>,
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;
<p>
The loudest cry for help to battle pop culture's negative influence
comes from single parents.  Nearly two of every three single parents
told FRC they agree with the statement, &quot;These days, it is
too difficult for parents to deal with this [the pop culture]
alone.&quot;
<p>
Ultimately, parents are responsible and should monitor what kids
consume.  They should also explore technical devices that control
what kids watch  -- The Telecommander or TV Guardian -- and express
their views to the entertainment industry.
<p>
The entertainment industry is not without responsibility, however.
It demonstrated good citizenship when it created the ratings
now assigned to movies.  Comic book producers banned certain material,
and recently two national music distributors announced renewed
efforts to improve the Parental Advisory Program that flags sound
recordings which contain explicit lyrics.
<p>
More needs to be done.  TV networks ought to eliminate objectionable
programming or re-establish a &quot;family viewing hour&quot;
or &quot;safe harbor&quot; during which no objectionable material
is shown or advertised.  They should also cut gratuitous violence
and sexually explicit material.   By endorsing V-chip technology
they could help parents better control what enters the living
rooms of America.
<p>
Clear majorities told FRC they want an independent rating system
for television and music and the ability to block objectionable
cable television and computer material from their homes.

<title>WATCHING IS NOT OKAY</title>

<h2>WATCHING IS NOT OKAY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
What happened to Dr. Kevorkian as he worked in steel rooms cutting
into the last remains of someone's family? What happened to the
pathologist whose job it was to determine the way death came --
rather than to be the cause of that death?
<p>
What kind of thoughts entered his mind as he saw the signature
of death? Did he wish he could have been there? 
<p>
And then later, this scavenger of death, this man whose entire
living depended on the deaths of others, later his thoughts turned,
where?  To, &quot;I can be there&quot; or &quot;I can be the cause&quot;?
<p>
Recently Dr. Kevorkian was involved in another woman's death,
but this time, she wasn't so sick.  Physicians seemed to have
halted the decline toward death. Until Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
And so we find in this drama that the reality was that the true
state of this woman's health was her mental health. And she was
abandoned to a voyeuristic death, Dr. Kevorkian having helped
her decide that her life wasn't worth living.
<p>
Or was it?
<p>
No one seems to remember that the first duty to one's depressed
friend -- to a fellow human being -- is not to speed them to death,
but to cheer them up and help them find the strength to go on.
We are inspired by the lovely wife of Christopher Reeve who helps
him see all that remains in life for him to accomplish.
<p>
But today they seem rare, for we live in a culture that glamorizes
death.
<p>
Recently my husband and I drove by a prominent theater in our
nation's capitol, and on the marquee every movie hawked a vision
of death. <I>Copy Cat</I> and the thrill of serial killing; <I>Devil
in a Blue Dress</I> and the fun of blackmail and betrayal, <I>Dead
Presidents</I> and the joy of a horrific war experience followed
by unemployment; <I>7</I> and the beauty of twisted 
justice; even a <I>Vampire in Brooklyn</I> and the spice of the
&quot;undead&quot; and their appetites.
<p>
But for those of us weaned on shootings and our &quot;right&quot;
to bad taste, no mere knowledge of death will do any longer for
some.
<p>
We can't know -- in Alfred Hitchcock fashion -- that someone in
the next room just left this mortal coil. Now we must see it,
slow motion, full color, <I>Pulp Fiction</I> frame by frame, until
we're so hardened to the sight of human suffering, that the nausea
rape, torture, murder and old fashioned fear just don't do much
for us anymore.
<p>
But blood isn't a big screen phenomena. If the money is not in
the budget for movies, there is always television.
<p>
One recent Friday night, free speech and hardened sensibilities
served up battery and slow death in prison on the <I>X-files</I>;
murderous people killing enemies by slow death by maggots on <I>American
Gothic</I>, and various forms of shootings, stabbings and stalkings
-- and that is without all those really seamy &quot;true-to-life&quot;
cop dramas where we not only get to see brain-like matter splatter,
we are exposed to portly policemen in the shower, making washing
decisions on a national screen despite what modesty and good taste
would indicate.
<p>
Having been a reporter who covered the court and police beats,
I can say first hand that  what is missing from these true to
life dramas is real life. Police are usually people working hard,
thinking of their kids, trying to find out what really happened
at the scene of a tragedy. They're not soap operas in blues. They
live out the unglamorous reality of hard work and dignified people.
<p>
So where does this leave America? Where does this lead the world?
Into the valley of the shadow of death, into the imagined worlds
of men like Dr. Kevorkian, who seems to believe that just because
he can invent a machine that kills he should be allowed to ...
and allowed to watch.
<p>
Ironically, when Dr. Kevorkian kills, the media responds by putting
on &quot;reasoned&quot; discussions of euthanasia, asking bubble-headed
bleach blonde questions about the &quot;right to die&quot; rather
than seeing that there is little difference between an elderly
man with a death machine, and kids killing kids with baseball
bats &quot;to watch.&quot;
<p>
News stories show us pictures of &quot;real life&quot; dramas
of children killing children to &quot;see what it was like&quot;
or to see a real murder. Children throwing tiny victims from high-rise
apartments. Children raping, stabbing and shooting. Life is worth
less than tennis shoes or jackets, and people have less worth
than laboratory rats.
<p>
Groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals advocate
using coma patients and those classed as brain dead for medical
experiments rather than the kinds of creatures that civilizations
have historically understood to be of less worth than children.
And in a survey I heard about, some people don't seem to understand
that if a child and a dog were drowning, the child should be the
first saved.
<p>
Out of what hole did Dr. Kevorkian crawl? Where did his passion
for death come from? In part, one wonders, from the notion that accidental 
life isn't worth the DNA it haphazardly &quot;evolved&quot; on.
<p>
From the deliberate rejection of founding ideals like the holding
of truths to be self evident, that all people are created equal
&quot;and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable
rights, among these are life ...&quot;
<p>
Human life ... each one unique, valuable, irreplaceable. Each
person with something to offer. And it does not have to be the
same things ... nor even the same abilities to walk or think or
paint.
<p>
A society that loses the sanctity of life has nothing left to
share but death. If there are no reliable standards of right and
wrong, then there is no reason to persevere or overcome -- if
you don't want to. No reason for people to reach out to you in
your darkest moment if they don't feel like it.  If we have no
common dignity then we share, at least, a common end. And so our
culture seems to revel in death, both by  murderous flashing images
on a screen and the real live voyeurism of thugs and Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
Somewhere along the line, Dr. Kevorkian seems to have decided
that he wanted to watch. In a civil society, the answer to that
is, &quot;No,&quot; and  &quot;Get some help.&quot;
<p>
Until we determine to embrace human life as the sacred and valuable
thing that it is, unique in all the world, and determine that
we will work together to enrich the human experience in practical
and real ways, we will have nothing in common but the fear and
fascination we have with the only thing we know for sure  -- the
fact that we will all die.
<p>
But there is more to life than death ... at least, there should
be.

<center><b>THE TOP FIVE REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE 1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS</b></center><ul>
<p><li><b>Congress should amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act,</b> making it applicable to all federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Defense, to include cost-benefit analysis; grant judicial review of regulations; require small business representation; and require the use of negotiated rulemaking with small business representation.
<p><li><b>Congress should reform the Comprehensive Environmental Response,</b> Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) to apply prospectively as well as retrospectively to clean up sites. This includes eliminating retroactive and strict liability prior to January 1, 1987; and requiring sound science and realistic risk assessments to assess health and environmental hazards.
<p><li><b>Congress shall mandate a complete review of current laws and regulations relating to public health and safety,</b> such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.
<p><li><b>Congress and the President should propose and enact legislation that reforms civil justice and product liability legislation</b> that include: 1) returning to a fault-based standard of liability; 2) eliminating joint and several liability; 3) limiting non-economic damages to three times the economic damages or $250,000 which ever is greater; and 4) providing for periodic, instead of lump sum payments for future medical or lost income.
<p><li><b>Congress shall enact legislation and appropriate enforcement</b> that includes: 1) requiring that all agencies provide a cooperative/consulting regulatory environment; 2) requiring that fines take into consideration the severity of the infraction; 3) requiring that regulatory agencies put the fines that they impose and collect into the general treasury fund to be used toward retiring the national debt; and 4) requiring that enforcement actions comply with American due process concepts.

<P><TT><B><A NAME="45">45</A></B></TT>  It is
important to note that the  company which buried the chemicals in the area, 
Hooker Electrochemical Company, encased them in a  thick protective tube of
impenetrable clay with  the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.
Unfortunately, the Niagara Falls Board of  Education, through threat of eminent
domain, effectively forced the company to sell the  land (for $1), despite the
company's warnings that the land was contaminated and not fit for  public use. A
public elementary school was built on the site, and city construction crews 
bulldozed through the clay seal, allowing the  chemicals into the surrounding
soil. Additionally, some of the land was sold off for  residential housing.
Thus, the problems at Love Canal  were the direct result of government

<a name="intro"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Congress likely will consider legislation this year to reauthorize the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Superfund, as CERCLA is popularly known, only is one of the most complex laws now in force, but also is widely regarded as both wasteful and ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not work.  One reason for is that, despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30 billion, Superfund has failed to clean up more than a small fraction of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites.  Under the current law, cleanup of the remaining current and potential sites could cost additional tens of billions of dollars.
<p>
Fortunately, there is an opportunity for substantive reform in Congress this year. Senator Robert Smith (R-NH), Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommitee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment, and Representative Michael Oxley (R-OH), Chairman of the House Committee on Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Hazardous Materials, early this session decided to undertake a top-to-bottom review of the program.<Font Size="-1">1</Font>  "If you recognize [Superfund] when we are done," declared Oxley recently, "we won't have done our jobs."<Font Size="-1">2</Font> 
<p>
Congress must correct the fundamental flaws in the current program,
not merely tinker with the statute as last year's bills would have done.<Font Size="-1">3</Font>  Reform should address the core elements of the Superfund structure that fuel litigation, slow cleanups, raise costs, and, most important, encourage the cleanup of sites that pose little risk to human health and safety and divert scarce economic resources from sites that may pose real dangers.
<p>
Specifically, Superfund reform should:
<ul>
<li>Encourage faster cleanups;
<li>Eliminate most of the need for lawyers and courts;
<li>Reduce total spending on CERCLA compliance;
<li>Be fairer to those who now pick up the tab for other people's pollution;
<li>Prioritize risks so that the most public safety possible is bought for the money spent;
<li>Encourage similar reforms at high priority state sites;
<li>Give states authority over a local problem;
<li>Give states funding to pay for their new responsibilities;
<li>Ensure public safety by continuing to allow immediate cleanup of sites that pose an imminent threat to human health;
<li>Reduce taxes on businesses;
<li>Encourage competitive bidding for cleanup work;
<li>Reduce total federal spending;
<li>Reimburse firms that have cleaned up sites under the current law for a portion of their costs; and
<li>Reduce potentially responsible parties' (PRPs)<Font Size="-1">4</Font> annual costs substantially.
</ul>
<p>
<b><a name="costs">LARGE COSTS AND FEW RESULTS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund program was enacted after widespread press attention
to the exposure of residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals
Canal near Niagara Falls, New York.<Font Size="-1">5</Font>  Intended to force companies to clean up hazardous waste sites, the law also established a government fund to pay for cleanup of "orphan sites," which are contaminated properties where no responsible party exists -- where the polluter, for example, has gone out of business.<Font Size="-1">6</Font>  The law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the Carter Administration, and many provisions were ill-considered. Although estimates vary, most experts agree that the program has cost at least $20 billion while utterly failing to clean up most hazardous waste sites. Explains Carol Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "A lot of time and money is taken up with companies suing each other they owe to clean up a particular site."<Font Size="-1">7</Font>
<p>
Congress authorized $15.2 billion for CERCLA's trust fund during
the 1990 budget deal. Of this amount, $10.8 billion was spent
by the federal government through fiscal 1994.  The amount spent by companies and individuals to comply with CERCLA overall price tag by many billions of dollars.<Font Size="-1">8</Font>
<p>
Much of this cost has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal
fees and other "transaction costs."  And while program costs have ballooned, cleanups have proceeded slowly.  Only 291, or about 24 percent, of the 1,238 "worst" sites placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) -- have been cleaned up.<Font Size="-1">9</Font>  To clean up the remaining sites already on the NPL will cost the EPA alone an estimated $40 billion. A similar amount is estimated to be spent for state sites. If  the cost of cleaning up federal facilities is added to the equation, the total could exceed $750 billion, or about $7,800 per household.<Font Size="-1">10</Font>
<p>
<b><a name="super">SUPERFUND'S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund's combination of heavy cost and modest impact results
from four fundamental problems with CERCLA:
<p>
<ol>
<li>As written, the law is designed to reduce chemicals in the ground, not reduce risks to people;
<li>The program's unreasonable standards require that hazardous waste sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what the location, resulting in a poor return on the investment;
<li>Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems, but listings, cleanup decisions, and program federal bureaucracy; and
<li>The law's retroactive, strict, joint and several liability scheme results in endless legal battles as potentially liable parties fight EPA, then each other, and shoulder the costs of cleanup.
</ol>
Each of these characteristics drives up costs while blunting the
effectiveness.  The reauthorization legislation must correct these flaws.
<p>
<b>Flaw #1: Cleaning up chemicals takes priority over protecting health.</b>
<p>
The most important question that should be asked in the reauthorization has not been asked in Superfund debates:  What should be the basic intent of the law? CERCLA was enacted amid fears that some Americans were at risk from hazardous wastes.  Yet the law was not designed specifically to reduce risk to the public. Rather, the goal was cleaning up spilled chemicals.

To be sure, cleaning up chemicals does help protect public health
if the sites being cleaned would expose the public to real risks.
But if there is no threat of risk to the public -- and there would be none without a land use change -- then money is squandered
that could have been used elsewhere to save more lives. Policymakers
take into account such "opportunity costs" spending decisions. As Heritage analysts have noted, "Policy makers generally fail to recognize the simple truth that using resources one way means not using them in other ways that could results....[T]hey ignore the benefits, including much greater possible reductions in risks to individuals, that could be achieved by using these purpose."<Font Size="-1">11</Font>
<p>
From a public health perspective, poor choices are made routinely
in the Superfund program. According to the Office of Technology
Assessment, the listing of most Superfund sites is based on hypothetical risks.<Font Size="-1">12</Font>  Economists Kip Viscusi and James Hamilton found similar results.<Font Size="-1">13</Font> Their study found that hypothetical potential future risks account for 90 percent of "risk-weighted pathways"
at Superfund sites.  For one-third of the sites studied, there is no current risk but only future risks. Moreover, for most of these hypothetical future risks, future generations would be at risk only if homes are built on sites that are not currently residential.<Font Size="-1">14</Font>
<p>
While it would seem prudent to protect against such potential
occurrences as the likely loss of clean aquifers or threats to
human health, actions to avoid hypothetical threats to life should
not have the same claim on already scarce resources.<Font Size="-1">15</Font>  Unfortunately, because Superfund is designed principally to clean up chemicals, the program costs a great deal but achieves little improvement in public health.<Font Size="-1">16</Font>
<p>
<b>Flaw #2: Overly stringent cleanup standards divert resources from more effective uses.</b>
<p>
The extremely high cost of cleanup is closely related to the question
of reducing risk. For the average site, the estimated cost is about $25 million, even though, as a category, hazardous waste considered by EPA to be a medium to low health risk.<Font Size="-1">17</Font>  The cost is so unnecessarily high because of overly stringent and inflexible cleanup standards for hazardous waste sites.
<p>
In addition to requiring expensive cleanups of sites that pose
little or no risk to the public, the standards require that sites
posing a real risk be cleaned up to a level that goes beyond what
is needed to reduce the risk to acceptable levels. For instance,
polluted soil at industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a
level that makes it essentially clean enough to eat. But while
may ingest contaminated dirt accidentally, or even purposefully,
few are likely to be found playing in the dirt at an industrial
park. 
<p>
Cleanup standards should reflect the real risk to a person likely
to be found at the site based on expected exposure, not on some
hypothetical and very unlikely scenario. An industrial park does
not need to be as pristine as a playground.
<p>
 In other instances, no risk exists unless there is some change
in how the land is used.<Font Size="-1">18</Font>  Often, the owners have no plans for development or current use.  Yet
rather than simply require a deed restriction that forbids change unless the site is cleaned up to a level appropriate for any proposed
change in use, the Superfund program requires the PRP to clean
up the site even if it poses no real risk as currently used.
<p>
Real risks also are not addressed in the most cost-effective manner.
instance, CERCLA's preference for permanent cleanup, as opposed
to ongoing treatment or containment, drives up costs for remediation
by discouraging containment and isolation. Blanketing layers of
plastic and clay on the soil, surrounding the property with a
fence, and posting guards might eliminate exposure to the public
for a small fraction of the cost of remediation. But this option
usually is not used.
<p>
Moreover, Superfund is structured so that states have a strong
incentive to demand unnecessarily strict cleanup standards. States
pay only 10 percent of remedial construction costs at fund-led
sites, but the law requires them to pay 100 percent of the Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) costs of such Superfund sites. Even
though periodic, ongoing treatment may be cheaper and may reduce
public exposure equally well, therefore, the states have a built-in
incentive to demand one-time, permanent, and extremely strict
cleanup standards so they can avoid future O&M costs.  Meanwhile,
companies responsible for paying for cleanup needlessly pay more.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #3:  The law does not permit local problems to be handled locally.</b></h4>
<p>
Perhaps the most puzzling feature of Superfund is that it is a
federal program. Indeed, CERCLA is not delegated to the states,
unlike all other major environmental laws. But hazardous waste
sites are, at their core, a local problem. If there is any federal
environmental law for which a legitimate case can be made for
devolving authority back to the states, it is CERCLA. Contrary
to the usual argument put forth by those who oppose shifting to
jurisdiction -- that states cannot be trusted to protect their
population -- state and local officials are far more accountable for local risks under their control than are distant federal officials. It is highly unlikely that states would neglect public health and safety concerns, especially given the general awareness and level of knowledge that exist today.
<p>
To deal with any possible problems associated with devolution,
certain safeguards could be built into the system. For instance,
emergency removals that target sites posing immediate and substantial risks could continue at the federal level. Since the EPA has extensive experience and is relatively efficient at emergency response to sites that are truly hazardous, it could maintain the capacity emergency responses.  This is not to say that the EPA emergency program is without its critics, but experience with this program generally has been better than with other parts of Superfund. Of course, safeguards would be needed to prevent abuse of what constitutes an emergency and to curtail the well-known problem of "bureaucratic creep."
<p>
There is another very important reason for returning authority
over hazardous waste sites to the states:  The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution reserves to the states all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government.The federal government should assume responsibility only for issues that are national in scope and interest. Federal involvement in the cleanup of local hazardous waste sites does not meet this standard. In fact, it is hard to imagine anything better suited to the exercise of state leadership and authority than local problems associated with the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.
<p>
<b><h4>Flaw #4:  The determination of liability leads to endless legal battles.</b></h4>
<p>
One of the most damning, though inaccurate, criticisms of Superfund
is that 80 percent of the money has gone to lawyers rather than
for cleanup.  This figure, commonly cited in the press, overstates the litigation costs severalfold, but the substance of the criticism is correct: Superfund's liability scheme encourages litigation and other transaction costs. Further, numerous "horror stories" of individual citizens and small businesses subjected to millions of dollars in potential liability for what most people would consider innocent acts, some of them committed generations ago. For instance, Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a Superfund site at a battery
cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His contribution to the problem? He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the items. Since the checks had issued by the now-bankrupt company that had owned the battery cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as a PRP by another company caught in CERCLA's liability scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he should settle to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed pay $3,500.<Font Size="-1">19</Font>
<p>
One of the major causes of such legal woes is the concept of joint
and several liability, under which even minor contributors to
a problem (for example, someone who tosses a car battery into
a landfill) can be held responsible for the entire multi-million
dollar cost of cleanup.<Font Size="-1">20</Font>
<p>
The concept is designed to find somebody -- anybody -- to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste, even if the "responsible" person has only a tiny part in creating the waste problem. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" ends up paying for the cleanup of wastes created by someone else.  Naturally, any person or institution identified as a PRP has a strong incentive to show that others are liable as well, in order to spread the costs among more PRPs. Litigation is virtually assured.
<p>
Faced with large and uncertain liability, PRPs typically protect
themselves by hiring lawyers. Thus, rather than quick payments
from "polluters," the liability scheme encourages legal gridlock, cleanup delay, and enormous legal costs. A recent report estimated total government, PRP, and insurer transaction costs of about $1.3 billion at NPL sites.<Font Size="-1">21</Font>  Although EPA Administrator Carol Browner has admitted the need for reform, she also claims that "a lot of come from the program.  The polluter-pays
concept that was first adopted in the Superfund law has changed
the way businesses deal with their waste."  But, Superfund "polluter-pays" system.  Joint and several liability merely guarantees that people like Zimmer pay for cleanup instead of those who are really responsible. In short, it works against the idea of making polluters pay the that their actions impose on others.<Font Size="-1">22</Font>
<p>
Perhaps the most controversial part of the liability scheme is
its retroactivity.<Font Size="-1">23</Font>  Retroactive liability
means that owners, operators, and other individuals and companies
otherwise liable under the strict, joint and several standards
are held responsible for pollution that took place before it became
illegal. For example, a company could be held liable for any pollution
that occurred before the Superfund law was passed in 1980. If
company made jeep parts during World War II, and during production some chemicals seeped into the ground, it would be legally responsible for cleaning up those chemicals though the manufacturing activity was legal at the time. Because of a law passed more than 35 years later, the company may face tens of millions of dollars in cleanup costs.<Font Size="-1">24</Font>
<p>
While retroactive liability is considered by many to be a violation
that "No... ex post facto Laws shall be passed," it also is simply unfair. Under the law as enforced, for instance, a farmer his grandfather -- or even some intervening owner of whom he has
never heard  -- fouled the sub-soil 50 years earlier using then state-of-the-art equipment.  The farmer must fix the entire problem, no matter how much it costs. But if he caused the problem himself back in the he be expected to know that his actions -- considered
legal and time -- might destroy his children's inheritance of
the family farm? Both environmental sensitivity and environmental knowledge have increased exponentially since that time.
<p>
Retroactive liability has triggered an avalanche of litigation
which probably is the biggest contributor to Superfund's failure
to achieve its primary objective of cleaning hazardous waste sites.
Perhaps the most important practical problem is that retroactive
liability increases the number of PRPs for any given site. Numerous
individuals and companies may have owned the land over the decades, each owner typically dealing with others who might also be considered liable. Since many owners and other potentially liable parties have poor records or no records at all for activities several
decades ago -- it is little wonder that those already targeted by the EPA challenge EPA about the remedies selected to keep costs down, pursue other PRPs to spread costs, and sue insurers to recover costs under old policies. 
<p>
In all, transaction costs account for approximately $1.3 billion
annually from all sources. According to the Rand Institute for
Civil Justice, the average cost for PRPs varies from 17 percent
depending on the size of the party held liable.<Font Size="-1">25</Font>  Reform of the Superfund program, however, should eliminate most of these huge transaction costs.
<p>
<b><a name="craft">CRAFTING A PROGRAM THAT WORKS</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
The political key to real reform is to end the infighting between
industry sectors over which will win and which will lose with
changes in the law.  The focus should be on benefiting all government  industry sectors so that, even if the mix of benefits is uneven, the least benefited sector or company is substantially better off under the new law. And to encourage states to accept responsibility for the program, a state fund should be created that is sufficiently attractive to motivate them to extend these reforms beyond National Priorities List sites to high risk state sites.
<p>
An effective Superfund reform proposal should increase fairness,
accelerate cleanups, reduce costs across the board, and more fully
protect the public from real risks. It also should reduce costs
so that no tax increase is necessary to fund the new Superfund
law -- even though retroactive liability would be eliminated for waste disposal at NPL sites before 1987.
<p>
Congress can accomplish these objectives by incorporating certain
features into this year's reauthorization legislation:
<p>
<b>1)  States should have authority over current "orphaned"  sites -- with funding.</b>
<p>
Rather than have the federal government clean up sites for which
no one else is liable, state governments should be responsible
for these costs.These sites, by their very nature, are local problems. Moreover, state governments likely are far more efficient than EPA in conducting cleanups. 
<p>
A revolving loan fund -- or direct payment fund -- or direct payment fund -- should pay for most of the projected cleanup costs transferred
to the states. Initially, the federal share could be perhaps 90
percent, to be scaled down over time. A revolving loan would constrain
the natural tendency to require that sites be restored to pristine
conditions. A higher state share, however, likely would have the
same beneficial effect.
<p>
States should be allowed to dedicate the funds to any of their
most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred
government.  The condition would be that they enact the changes specified below, the most important being that they prioritize sites without regard to who for cleanup and spend the funds according to that prioritization.  Moreover, they should not use retroactive liability for financing at those sites where federal funds are used. They could continue, of course, to use any liability system they chose for other sites.  This would encourage flexibility and prioritization of cleanup.
It would also help states reach what should be their main objective:
reducing health-threatening risks to their citizens as effectively
and comprehensively as possible.
<p>
A revolving loan fund also should be available for cleaning up
sites.  Typically, businesses locate at abandoned industrial sites -- or
brownfields -- because of their legitimate fear of having to bear the cost of cleaning up hazardous wastes they did not create. So they tend to locate their new facilities sites that have had no previous industrial activity.  This neither makes economic nor environmental
sense.  For sites not currently on the NPL, states could use the revolving to encourage development whenever the need for cleanup causes the land to have a negative worth. In addition, EPA should be
prohibited from second-guessing state remedy and liability decisions
at such sites.
<p>
<p>
<b>2)  EPA should retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
<p>
Since the EPA is both experienced and relatively efficient at
emergency response to truly hazardous waste problems, it should
to conduct emergency responses.  To prevent abuses, each state would have the authority to decide whether a site constitutes an emergency. Either the state or a liable PRP would be required to pay for such cleanups through a cost recovery action.
<p>
<b>3) Standards for cleanup should be determined by the states, limited only by certain provisions of law that would be required to adopt to qualify for funding.</b>
<p>
Remedy and site selection standards generally should be left to
the states.
<p>
The states would have to agree, however, to prioritize sites according
to their real risk of human exposure, and to prioritize spending
risk reduced for every dollar spent.  This would give them the "biggest
bang for the buck" in protecting public health.
<p>
The states would be required to not use retroactive liability
(discussed in the following section) for all sites for which federal
funding is provided. Otherwise, they would have an incentive to
transfer costs to the private sector.
<p>
The states should be allowed to spend the new funds on cleanup
of non-NPL sites, provided they agree to extend the new liability
standards to that class of sites.
<p>
Adopting flexible performance standards and other remedy selection
changes would mean enormous savings on the cleanup portion of
total costs. Cost savings of 35 percent typically are estimated
by industry, although some experts believe the real savings could
be twice this amount. Adoption of these standards, however, should
not be made a condition of funding; responsibility for cleanup
costs without the use of retroactive liability, combined with
the funding condition of site prioritization, would encourage
state flexibility without specific standards.
<p>
<b>4) Reform the liability system.</b>
<p>
A more rational standard for assessing liability would:
<p>
<b>Eliminate joint and several liability.</b>  The courts generally have interpreted CERCLA to mean that anyone who has even a slight interaction with the site is liable for the whole cleanup costs.  This
creates a situation where a person or company whose actions caused little or no harm can be pursued for the whole cost of cleanup. Reform would make clear that liability is not joint and several, but instead proportional to a PRP's contribution. This would send the right economic and behavioral signals to the market, and liability would harness fight market forces. For the first time, the "polluter pays" principle actually would be put into practice.
<p>
<b>Repeal retroactive liability.</b>  Retroactive
liability makes people or firms responsible for activities that
took place in the past when they were legal.  Thus, for instance, a landowner is responsible for cleanup of hazardous at the turn of the century by a previous owner.  While the U.S. Supreme Court has not found that retroactive liability violates the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws, holding people liable for actions taken before 1980 is patently unfair to those caught in its web and contrary to American notions of justice. Moreover, it is largely unnecessary. Repeal of retroactive liability, however, need not interfere with a private party's rights to sue for damages. Under the common law, if an action causes harm to a neighboring property, or a party contributes to a public nuisance, the party is liable under tort.
<p>
The date before which no liability would exist could either be
1981, when the original Act took effect, or 1987, when substantial
changes took effect. Even though the fairness argument is not
as obviously compelling for disposals before 1987 as it is for
before 1981, 1987 is preferable for a number of reasons.  The most important is that CERCLA is only a liability statute. It does not set rules for disposal. That is done by RCRA and other laws. These laws primarily took effect or were modified from 1980 through 1986. For example, RCRA's disposal and record keeping rules were extended to 175,000 more entities in 1986.  Unfortunately, many, if not most, companies reasonably believed or were legally advised that if they were in compliance with RCRA and the other laws, they could continue their disposal practices.  Yet these same companies are now liable under CERCLA for their innocent conduct. The 1987 date also is preferable for the sake of efficiency and lowering society's total CERCLA cost burden.  Until 1987, disposal rules for all parties were not clear and records under CERCLA are scanty. If the 1981 date is adopted, protracted court battles and slow cleanups would remain at a large of sites. State governments -- with funding -- would become responsible for cleanup of old "orphan" sites where PRPs are not liable under the new standard.
<p>
<b>Exempt remediation firms and trustees from liability negligence or willful neglect.</b>  These firms can become liable for problems associated with cleanup, "construction" firms willing to assume the risk of cleaning up problems caused by others.  While these firms
should be exempt from strict liability as a matter of law (using the common law standard of gross negligence and willful misconduct), PRPs also should be allowed to contract a greater degree of liability to
those cleanup firms willing to take the additional risk for higher
pay.
<p>
<b><a name="pay">WHO SHOULD PAY</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
One of the most contentious issues in the Superfund reform debate
concerns who should pay for cleanups. If retroactive liability
and joint and several liability are repealed, some level of government
responsible for those newly "orphaned" sites where contamination occurred before the cutoff date -- 1987 under this proposal.  For sites that the government cleaned up, the costs no longer
PRPs, but by the government entity -- state government under
proposal -- that decided the site ranked high enough to merit timely cleanup.
<p>
Since few states would rush to embrace reform that saddled them
with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs, a federally
supported state fund would seem reasonable if the program is devolved back to the states.  Where would the federal government obtain this money, and how large a fund would be necessary?
<p>
Currently, the trust fund has about $1.9 billion in annual revenue
and a  prior, unappropriated balance of about $2.5 billion that
is not obligated.  This fund has been raised through a variety of mechanisms, including annual taxes on petroleum (%557 million) and chemicals ($250 million) and a Corporate Environmental
Income Tax of $653 million.<Font Size="-1">26</Font>  These taxes
are set to expire at the end of 1995. In addition, Congress generally
has appropriated $250 million annually for Superfund, and federal
agencies have significant PRP liability at these non-federal facility
NPL sites.
<p>
Covering the expected additional costs to the states for accepting
for this program will require more than the unappropriated
currently in the trust fund. One solution would be to reauthorize
collection of taxes at current levels for the next several years,
slow phaseout of the federal fund could begin.  The costs to states should reduce over time in any event, since the number of NPL sites transferred to them would be fixed.  But there is intense debate over whether current tax levels could finance cleanups with retroactive liability repeal for all current PRPs.  The question is important
because taxes are not likely to be raised. Nor should they be. Indeed,
reform eventually should phase out taxes. But that does not preclude
reexamining either the current mix of funding or the budgetary
vehicle for collecting and spending this revenue stream.
<p>
Lawmakers should note that current Superfund taxes have been used
to fund programs unrelated to Superfund. Funding substantive reform
will require using these revenues to clean up hazardous waste
sites. If the financial flows into and out of the fund are sustainable,
program should be able to "pay for itself," the budgetary process.<Font Size="-1">27</Font>
<p>
The financial implications of repealing retroactive liability and joint and several liability were analyzed by National Strategies,
(NSI).<Font Size="-1">28</Font>  The Barents Group of Peat Marwick, which the study independently, found the analysis to be "carefully conducted, well documented, and to represent a fair assessment of the financial flows...."<Font Size="-1">29</Font>  NSI's conclusions help make the case for a substantive overhaul of Superfund.
<p>
One of the NSI report's key conclusions is that repeal of retroactive
liability for waste disposal that occurred before 1987 is achievable
with the current revenue stream without using the unappropriated
$2.5 billion currently in the trust fund.  The main reason is that significant inefficiencies would be eliminated through reform.<Font Size="-1">30</Font>  The report does not factor in the substantial benefits to be realized through risk prioritization or remedy selection improvements. Savings estimates vary from about 25-70 percent of cleanup costs, but even the more conservative estimates indicate that the amount would be significant.  These savings, as well as about $2.5 billion now in the fund, could be used for other purposes, such as a revolving loan fund for cleanup of state sites that are not on the federal NPL list.
<p>
The NSI report's financial conclusions suggest that, far from
being saddled with additional costs, states could be given access
to a loan fund for addressing waste sites now handled and financed
solely at the state level, since the current fund and expected
future savings not factored into the report would create a significant
pool of funds.<Font Size="-1">31</Font>  Under the proposal here, the only strings attached to the funds would be that states would have to prioritize state sites according to risk and not use their onerous liability laws, if applicable, for the sites high on the list for which federal funds would be provided. Put another way, no funds could be used for sites lower on the priority list unless retroactive,  joint and several liability is not applied to sites higher on the list.<Font Size="-1">32</Font>  A revolving loan fund would be available for cleaning up old industrial sites as well.<Font Size="-1">33</Font>  
<p>
Although the level of funding required to support reform would
depend largely on its structure, the total needed to implement
fully the recommendations outlined in this paper would be around
$2 billion annually. After several years, however, taxes or user
fees could be reduced to reflect anticipated savings. It is critical
that Congress appropriate to the reformed program all Superfund
tax revenue, the current general revenues appropriation, and at
least the annual interest on the current unappropriated trust
fund balance.
<p>
<b><a name="conl">CONCLUSION</a></b><br>
( <a href="#contents">Contents</a> )
<p>
Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments, municipalities,
and the private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,
unnecessary, and expensive burdens of the program. Specifically,
the reformed CERCLA should at least:
<ol>
<b><li>Turn authority for current NPL sites over to the states  -- with the necessary funding.</b> To qualify for funds, states should be required to meet two conditions.
<ul>
--Prioritize sites and expenditures based on real risks. <br>
--Eliminate joint and several liability completely and retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites cleaned with federal funds.
</ul>
<b><li>Allow states to use funds for any of their most serious hazardous waste sites, not just NPL government.</b>  These conditions would have to apply, or states would be tempted simply to spend the money on sites for which they were responsible rather than on those that are most dangerous.
<p>
<b><li>Create a revolving loan fund for cleaning up old industrial sites.
</b>
<p>
<b><li>Allow EPA to retain emergency cleanup capacity.</b>
</ol>
If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted, Superfund
will continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on the
American economy. But if proper reforms are instituted, Congress
can achieve its original goal of protecting Americans from hazardous
wastes at reasonable cost.

<li>It is important to note that the company that buried the chemicals in the area, Hooker Electrochemical Company, buried them in a thick protective tube of impermeable clay with the intent of maintaining ownership of the land. Unfortunately, the Niagara Falls Board of Education, through threat of eminent domain, effectively forced the company to sell the land (for $1), despite the company's warnings that the land was contaminated and not fit for public use. A public elementary school was built on the site, and city construction crews bulldozed through the clay seal, allowing the chemicals into the surrounding soil. Additionally, some of the land was residential housing. Thus, the problems at Love Canal were the direct result of government interference. <p>

<li>Retroactive liability is not expressly provided for in the text of CERCLA, but it is clear from the usage of the past tense that Congress intended it to be retroactive.  Moreover, the courts have interpreted that the intent of the law was to impose retroactive liability.<p>

<li>NSI, <i>The Costs of Superfund: A Financial Analysis</i>.<p>
<li>Budgetary barriers such as "pay go" should be avoided.  Since taxes expire at the end of the year, future revenues should be raised as user fees applied primarily to industries which have generated pollution.  Not only would this be more consistent with the original reason for raising revenues from corporations -- to finance the cleanup of problems caused by their industries -- but it would avoid unnecessary and arbitary budgetary barriers that would threaten reform.<p>

<li>Barents Group of Peat Marwick, "Review of the National Strategies, Inc.  Report:  <i>The Costs of Superfund: A Financial Analysis</i>," June 13, 1995.<p>
<li>For instance, repealing the liability scheme as well as devolving authority back to the states would mean shifting the costs of cleanup to the government, but saving from this shift also would occur.  With repeal of retro active, joint and several liability for pre-1987 sites, PRPs could expect to save $1.8 billion per year, much of which would not be passed on to government because fully 32 percent of current expenditures -- ranging from 17-60 percent depending on the size of the firm -- are wasted on leagal and other transactionco.  Yet the vast majority of these transactions costs would disappear since they are caused primarily by the liability scheme.  Transaction costs amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars incurred by EPA and the Department of Justice could be reduced and redirected to cleanup.  Similarly, other EPA overhead could be cut and redirected to cleanup.<p>
<li>The amount of anticipated savings could be withheld from the initial fund payments, which is not done now.<p>
<li>Some 40 states adopted CERCLA's liability scheme.<p>
<li>The NSI analysis specificaly assessed and compared the "financial flows" of Superfund under current law and the proposal crafted by Superfund '95(SR '95), a coalition of 600 local governemnts, small and large businesses, and insurers.  The NSI reported simply examines the financial flow of of implications of repealing joint and several liability and retroactive liability proir to 1987, but its financial analysis aupports the more dramatic reforms proposed here because the costs indentified would decrease substantially after a few years with remedy selection reform.  However, the costs under SR '95 and the Heritage Foundation approach would not differ significantly since both propose repeal of the liability scheme, which is a driving cost factor, inaddition to sharing some other key components.  Indeed, the proposal here should be less costly.<p>

to persons with 3 or more years of job  tenure that lost their jobs because
their plant or company closed or moved, there was  insufficient work for them to

Lost jobs refers to a decline in  the actual number of jobs or hours of
employment. Lost job opportunities refers to jobs not  created by employers that
otherwise would have been created without an increase in the  minimum wage.

Bill Pierce employed 25 salaried  professionals in his midwestern engineering
consulting business. Mr. Pierce also allowed  his workers to work flexible
schedules. During an investigation, the Department of Labor  declared that the
opportunity of flexible  schedules transformed Mr. Pierce's salaried workers 
into hourly employees subject to the FLSA's overtime provisions. DoL then
demanded that  Mr. Pierce pay his workers back overtime pay and penalties. The
result: Mr. Pierce had to  declare bankruptcy, and his employees lost their
jobs.

<P>

<b>AN EXAMPLE OF THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS: WASHINGTON, D.C.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Because Washington, D.C., is a unit on which federal statistics are available, and because of the city's out-of-wedlock birth rate with all its concomitant costs and effects, it already illustrates where the rest of the country is heading. These statistics -- some of the best available on any of America's urban areas -- dramatically illustrate the breakdown of our social institutions.
<p><b>Illegitimacy:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the percent of births to unmarried women in Washington, D.C., ranked as the very highest in the nation -- 64.9 percent of all births, 25 percentage points higher than Mississippi's second highest ranking of 40.5 percent.
<p><li>In 1990, the percent of births to teenage mothers in Washington ranked as fourth in the nation -- 17.8 percent of all births. For the highest-ranking state, Mississippi, the figure was 21.3 percent.
</ul><p><b>Abortion:</b>
<p><li>In 1988, the abortion ratio -- the number of abortions per 1,000 live births -- in Washington, D.C., was 1,248, the highest in the nation. In the second-highest state, New York, the number was significantly lower: 629 abortions per 1,000 live births.
</ul><p><b>Infant mortality:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the infant mortality rate in Washington, D.C., was the highest in the nation: 20.7.</ul><p>
<b>School performance:</b><ul>
<li>Per pupil public primary and secondary education expenditures: $8,057 - Rank: 2
<p><li>Pupil to teacher ratio: 14.4 to 1 - Rank: 1
<p><li>High school graduations: 60.2 - Rank: 49th out of 51
<p><li>SAT combined scores: 849 - Rank: 49th out of 51
</ul><p><b>Poverty:</b><ul>
<li>In 1989, Washington, D.C., ranked ninth in terms of individuals living below the poverty line with 16.9 percent.
</ul><p><b>Public welfare expenditures:</b><ul>
<li>Washington's 1991 per capita public welfare expenditures ranked as the very highest in the nation at $1,156.57.
<p><li>The city's per capita public welfare expenditures also exceeded those of other major U.S. cities:<ul>
<li>Washington, D.C.: $1,156.57
<li>New York City: $891.44
<li>Boston: $220.53
<li>Chicago: $34.68</ul></ul>
<p><b>Income tax:</b><ul>
<li><b>Top personal income tax rates:</b> Washington, D.C.'s top personal income tax rate ranks seventh-highest in the nation at 9.50 percent.
<p><li><b>Total taxes:</b> Overall, Washington's 1991 per capita taxes ranked second-highest in the nation at $4,036.83.<ul>
<li><b>Sales Tax:</b>  Rank: 3 - $755.15
<li><b>Income Taxes:</b> Rank: 1 - $1,253.08
<li><b>Property Taxes:</b>  Rank: 1 - $1,474.71
</ul></ul><p><b>Crime:</b><ul>
<li>Washington, D.C.'s 1992 total crime rate (per 100,000 population) ranked as the highest in the nation at 11,407.<ul>
<li><b>Violent crime:</b> Rank: 1 - 2,833 per 100,000 population
<li><b>Murder: Rank:</b> 1 - 75.2 per 100,000 population. Murder rate as compared to other major cities:<br>Washington, D.C.: 75.2<br>Dallas: 37.0<br>Chicago: 33.1<br>Los Angeles: 30.3<br>New York City: 27.1<br>Boston: 12.7</ul></ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Nothing illustrates the nature of the breakdown of communities better than a story from Mrs. Elayne Bennett, who runs a very successful program for young girls in the poorer part of Washington D.C., that helps them get their lives on track and avoid teen pregnancy. One of the young women working in her organization, Best Friends, was being courted by a good young man. Mrs. Bennett was looking forward to the wedding so that the girls could be invited to the church. None of them had ever seen a wedding. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	With illegitimacy rates so high for so long, a high proportion of the District of Columbia's young men have no fathers at home, or grandfathers at their grandmother's home. The boys have no real men in their lives. It is no wonder they end up in jail and out of work. The same story is repeated in all of America's major urban centers.

of  the dollar will be, especially far out into the future as is projected in
this number.  Over recent history, the dollar has dropped in  value by an

considerably lower the further out the projection goes.

from an analysis of adoption studies. Clinical  studies traditionally have shown
adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in  psychiatric settings. The same
occurred here, but the  adolescents were found not to have emotional or
psychological problems. Adopted adults are  less likely to receive treatment
than the general population. This seeming contradiction  occurs because adoptive
parents are more likely to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  refer their adopted children for
possible treatment. Of all adopted children referred by  parents for clinical
treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis. The remainder   almost 75
percent  received counseling for normal adolescent issues. Kathleen S.  Marquis

not all persons in the  lowest income quartile will receive welfare  benefits,
and some benefits will go to individuals  in higher income groups. Overall,
however, a reasonable estimate would put the total number  of recipients of
meanstested aid at about one quarter of the U.S. population. Thus, Charts  3 and
4 give a reasonably accurate picture of welfare spending relative to the
recipient  population.

purposes of consistency,  federal meanstested education aid is included with
welfare spending in the comparison. This  sum equaled $17.3 billion in 1993, or

into education would not materially affect the comparison in Chart 6.

spending. Shifting it from the  welfare category to the Social Security and

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="17">17</A></B></TT>    
Technically, the mother may be married  to a husband who works parttime at very
low wages and still be eligible for some aid under  the AFDCUP program. However,
if the husband works a significant number of hours per month,  even at a low
hourly rate, his earnings will be sufficient to eliminate the family's 
eligibility for AFDC and most other welfare.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="18">18</A></B></TT>     One
simplistic solution to the  dilemmas presented above would be to allow a 
welfare mother to retain all or most of her  welfare benefits after she has
taken a job or married  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  fully employed male. But this
approach would be unfair to working single mothers  and lowincome working
married couples who never went on welfare in the first place.  Moreover, low and
moderateincome parents would have  a huge incentive to enroll in welfare, at
least briefly, to become eligible for the  longterm continuing benefits. Such a
system would  devolve inevitably into one in which the majority of low and
moderateincome single  and twoparent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost  of welfare by hundreds of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic welfare reformers must seek  to alter welfare
incentives in a more practical manner.

example, modest work requirements  on males in the food stamp program have been
shown to reduce welfare rolls significantly,  cutting welfare costs by nearly a
third and immediately saving several dollars in welfare  expenditures for every
dollar spent operating  the work program. See data on the San Diego food stamp
workfare program in U.S. Department  of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service,

<P><TT><B><A NAME="43">43</A></B></TT>     There
should be no blanket twoyear  exemption from work requirements. Work
requirements which are imposed when a recipient  initially enrolls in welfare
are likely to have the strongest possible effect in reducing  welfare rolls
because they dissuade individuals from enrolling in welfare in the first  place.
Thus, serious work requirements mandated at the time of initial welfare
enrollment  are likely to be the most costeffective workfare programs.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Philadelphia, federal judge Norma Shapiro prevents judges from detaining many violent defendants before trial by prohibiting them from considering a defendant's prior criminal record, mental-health history, or drug dependency. The federal court also refuses to allow any pre-trial detention for such "non-violent" crimes as stalking, carjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terrorist threats, and weapons violations. State and local judges in Philadelphia are prohibited from forcing defendants to appear at trial, and the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice. Instead of being in jail, these individuals have gone on to commit numerous other crimes. Between 1994 and June 1995, Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 of these criminals (previously released under federal court orders) for 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug deals, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.

The bad news to the contrary notwithstanding, a small group of educators who are getting increasingly favorable play in the media are beginning to argue that the bad news is not bad news at all -- what is bad are the people (mostly conservatives) who report the bad news. A full-length book devoted to this subject, The Manufactured Crisis, was reviewed by the New York Times as though it were accurate (suggesting that even Times reviewers do not always read the books they are asked to review).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On December 22, 1995, The Washington Post ran an op-ed, "US Students: Better Than Ever." Author Gerald A. Bracey, a professional critic of the critics, argues that things have never been better, that "scores on many commercial achievement tests" and "the proportion of students scoring above 650 on the SAT mathematics test (on the old scale)" are "at an all time high." He does not tell the reader that commercial achievement test scores are the classic example of the "Lake Woebegone effect," named for Garrison Keillor's mythical town where the "children are all above average." Nor does he tell the reader who is pushing the SAT math scores higher (mostly Asian and Asian-American students). The real issue, of course, is not whether scores are higher or lower, but whether they are high enough. To say that higher is better is no different from saying that a 1970 Ford is better than a 1950 Ford; it may be true, but it is irrelevant.

No responsible educator or policy analyst believes that today's academic performance is good enough. Indeed, the sharpest critic of American academic performance is none other than Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Candidates for public office should not be fooled by fatuous assertions that test scores are "climbing" or that "kids today know more than kids did a generation ago." The problem is they still do not know enough. Today there is much more to know, which is all the more reason to demand more of the system.

<p>

<a name="anyone"> ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AND HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS CAN'T BE ALL BAD </a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers, has launched the AFT on a high-profile national campaign in support of high academic standards for all children and school discipline, primarily to protect the integrity of the learning environment. According to recent surveys and analyses by the Public Agenda Foundation, most Americans support straightforward academic standards and discipline. They believe increasingly that the problem is not in "somebody else's school" but in the school their children attend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Incredibly, other elements of the education establishment not only refuse to support Shanker, but actively oppose him and the AFT program. The Council of Great City Schools sent a letter to Shanker denouncing his program, asserting that members would not support such initiatives in their districts and arguing that "if these concepts are the unpinning's of educational [sic] reform... we seriously doubt that the national education goals will ever be met." According to Teacher Magazine, Shanker said the letter is "a justification of the current, failing system," adding that "the reasoning embodied in this letter is exactly what has given us school systems where children fear to come to school." The AFT deserves to be criticized for its position on school choice but should be commended for its position on discipline and standards.

<a name="isthe">IS THE EDUCATION CRISIS A FRAUD?</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>"A small group of outraged revisionists charges that a cabal of highly placed conservative leaders has conspired, with the help of the media, to destroy America's public schools."</I>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus opens the lead article on a new book, <I>The Manufactured Crisis,</I> by David Berliner and Bruce Biddle in <I>Teacher Magazine</i> for November-December 1995. The article shows why modern education is in so much trouble. It has been taken over by people like Berliner and Biddle, who apparently cannot think, write, or even develop a convincing conspiracy theory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Berliner and Biddle charge that former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennet and former Assistant Secretaries Chester E. Finn and Diane Ravitch, among others, have conspired to defame and ruin American public education through "organized malevolence." Such charges utterly trivialize a serious and well-intentioned debate by trying to demonize serious reformers. The book embodies a major irony, too subtle to be apprehended by its authors: As Ron Wolk, editor and publisher of <I>Teacher Magazine,</I> notes, "By defending the present system against an imaginary conspiracy and demolishing straw men they created, Berliner and Biddle distract attention from the central question ... and may make it harder to bring about the fundamental change needed if the system is to survive."

<a name="vouchers">VOUCHERS IN MILWAUKEE</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Milwaukee is the home of a nationally recognized voucher plan for low-income children. Spearheaded in 1990 by State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams, a Democrat, and signed into law by Governor Tommy Thompson, a Republican, the plan permits up to 1,000 low-income Milwaukee students to use an annually adjusted amount ($2,967 for the 1994-1995 school year) in state funds to attend a private, non-sectarian school of their parents' choice. The Milwaukee program began operation during the fall of 1990 with 300 children using vouchers at 6 private schools. In 1994, the program expanded to 832 students attending one of 11 participating private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In response to an August 25, 1995, Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting Governor Thompson's expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program to include religious schools, residents of Wisconsin donated more than $1.4 million, as of September 22, 1995, to help give the children of Milwaukee the ability to stay in the private schools chosen by their parents. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The campaign to keep these children in school was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education, Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.4 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $75,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The court's ruling left more than 2,300 children stranded after they already had signed up for classes in religious schools. They await the court's final ruling on the lawsuit that brought on the injunction, which was backed by the state and local teachers' unions and the American Civil Liberties Union.

<a name="charter">A CHARTER SCHOOL IN ACTION</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yvonne Chan, founder of the Vaughn Street Next Century Learning Center in Los Angeles, runs one of the most promising charter schools in the nation. Once part of the burdensome bureaucracy of the Los Angeles City Unified School District, the old Vaughn Street School won a $750,000, three-year, RJR Nabisco Next Century School Award five years ago. Thus empowered to act independently, Chan began significantly improving the education of her students and drawing the community into the life of the school. In 1994, Vaughn Street enjoyed a $1.2 million "windfall," the administrative overhead that the central office-HQ used to claim. The per-pupil allotment now goes directly to Vaughn Street, which spends the money on program improvement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of Chan's most dramatic accomplishments was the removal of a crack house next to her playground. Before Vaughn Street became a charter school, all Chan could do was call the police. Dealer and users would scatter, only to return within hours. As head of a charter school, Chan was able to buy the crack house, and, with the PTA's approval, hire a bulldozer and level it one Saturday afternoon. She plans to extend the playground into the newly vacant lot.

of American elementary and secondary education, there is not a single  columnist
who writes a regular column about it for  the national media or news services.
Yet elementary and secondary education spends more  than $280 billion a year,
enrolls 44 million youngsters, and employs 3 million teachers (and  an equal
number of janitors, cooks, crossing guards, and so on). At the same time, the 
only nationally circulated magazines for and about education (other than union
magazines)  have tiny circulations. The best, <CITE><U>Education  Week</U></CITE>,

<title>Abraham Amendment Would Give Hope to Failing Education System -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>ABRAHAM AMENDMENT WOULD GIVE HOPE TO AMERICA'S FAILING EDUCATION SYSTEM</i></h3>

By Denis P. Doyle and James F. Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 433<br>
October 16, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>

The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure.  Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.1  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending.  Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- real results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts and so hamper grass-roots reform.  It is time for Congress to terminate the program and divert the money to real reform.  A proposal by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) would do this through the appropriations process.
<p>
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
<p>
<b>1) Building Bureaucracies.</b> Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board.  These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of "command-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
<b>2) Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington.  The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct.  Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18.2 This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel.  Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
The states, on their own initiative, already have begun to reject federal interference in schooling.  "Outcomes Based Education" (OBE), a favorite idea of the education establishment, has offended and alienated thoughtful teachers and parents across the country and has mobilized opposition to the federal role.  Four states -- Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and, most recently, Alabama -- have turned down Goals 2000 funding, refusing to permit more federal intrusion.
<p>
It is clearly time to end Goals 2000.  In debating the FY 1996 Labor/HHS appropriations bill, Members of Congress have an opportunity to do this.  They could do so by adding Senator Abraham's proposal to Senator Dan Coats's (R-IN) amendment to the appropriations bill, the Educational Choice and Equality Act of 1995.
<p>
Senator Abraham's proposal is direct and straightforward.  It eliminates Goals 2000 outright.  The $310 million appropriated in the Labor/HHS report for FY 1996 under Goals 2000 would be transferred into two innovative education approaches to school reform:
<p>
	1) A "school choice" demonstration program and<br>
	2) Charter schools.
<p>
Under the Abraham proposal, federal funds would be available for new and innovative approaches to school reform.  Moreover, the Abraham proposal puts the federal government on record as supporting students and their families rather than institutions, using the GI Bill as its precedent.
<p>
In all other aspects of American life, choice among providers is a priceless asset, putting power in the hands of consumers. Only in elementary and secondary education is choice reserved for the well-to-do.  If enacted, the Abraham proposal would put school choice within the reach of countless poor youngsters who are now held hostage to a public school system in disarray.  It also would stimulate the development of charter schools, a promising avenue of locally generated reform that could help revitalize faltering public school systems.
<p>
Most important to those Americans committed to the principles of federalism and school reform, under the Abraham proposal funds would go directly to reform programs already supported by a majority of the nation's governors.  That means the money would bypass the institutions and agencies largely committed to the status quo and special interest groups.
<p>
Unlike President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and many Members of Congress, who are wealthy enough to send their children to the private school of their choice, poor and middle class parents are left with the public school monopoly.3  In many instances, this means that children are condemned to schools that can no longer teach simple reading and math adequately yet are expected to grapple with reform under the constraints and the restrictions imposed by Goals 2000.
<p>
Senator Abraham's proposal would end the federal government's ability to impose new mandates on schools, teachers, and parents. Instead, the proposal gives states the ability to enact school choice programs which allow every child in the American education system the opportunity to step out from under the shadow of the federal government.
<p>
Goals 2000 fails America's schools and America's school children.  Reforming America's education system cannot be achieved with more federal intrusion.  Existing funds must be spent more wisely and academic priorities established state by state.  No one in Washington -- certainly no employee of the U.S. Department of Education -- knows more about education priorities than parents and teachers or the nation's governors.

Tucker, "Goals 2000: Stifling Grass Roots Education Reform," Heritage Foundation <i>Issue Bulletin</i> No. 182, July 14, 1993, and William F.

<li>    The National Standards for United States History gives a distorted and politically correct view of American history.  For instance, George Washington is mentioned only briefly, while the founding of the Sierra Club and the National Organization for Women is given great attention. For a critique of the history standards, see Lynne V. Cheney, "The End of History," <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, October 20, 1994, p. A22.  Also see Carol Innerst, "History Rewritten for the Classroom," <i>The Washington Times</i>, October 26, 1994, p. A1.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>C</b>ongress is trying to reform the financially troubled Medicare
system, the huge, 30-year-old government program that insures
almost 38 million elderly and disabled Americans. The House of
Representatives recently passed the Medicare Preservation Act
(H.R. 2425). The Senate is working on similar legislation. As
both chambers consider this legislation, and how it might work
in practice, Members of Congress can learn much from the experience
of private corporations, where innovative plan designs have cut
costs  sometimes dramatically  while improving the quality of
care.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congressional action on Medicare is historic. The House bill will
save approximately $133 billion in the Hospital Insurance program
(HI, or Part A) over a seven year period and keep the hospitalization
trust fund solvent until 2010. It also will save $137 billion
in Part B, the part of Medicare that reimburses physicians, by
freezing Part B premiums at 31.5 percent of program costs, restructuring
payments to providers, and introducing market based reforms.<sup>1</sup> 
And it establishes a &quot;Medicare Plus&quot; option, where prpivate
plans, including plans with medical savings accounts, may compete
for the business of senior citizens who wish to obtain different
benefits or special medical services or procedures beyond what
is currently provided by traditional Medicare.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Financial Necessity</B>. Congressional action is also financially
necessary. Medicare is growing at 10.5 percent a year, a rate
of growth that most policymakers think is unsustainable without
unprecedented tax increases on working American families.<sup>2</sup>  Therefore,
the price of failing to reform Medicare will be alarming for America's
taxpayers. There are structural reasons why the program is so
costly. The program is based on 1960s-style concepts of government
central planning and price controls.<sup>3</sup>  And both of its key components
have failed to control costs. While costs have been exploding,
draining an ever-larger share of general revenues from other government
programs, the system has not been able to adapt quickly to innovations
in the financing and delivery of health care services that are
becoming common in the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress can learn much from the experience of private corporations.
To be sure, it must realize this experience has not occurred within
a normal market. The private-sector health insurance market is
distorted by the federal tax system, which discriminates against
individual and non-employer coverage, and hampered by complicated
rules and mandated benefits at the state level. Nevertheless,
Congress can apply key lessons from the experience of the private
sector to reform of the Medicare system. In particular, it can
obtain some insights into how a reformed Medicare might evolve
by examining the remarkable degree of innovation in corporate
plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The shape of private-sector insurance is changing rapidly. Two-thirds
of the private sector is covered by some kind of managed care
health plan, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs),
preferred providers (PPOs), and point of service (POS) plans.
Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are emerging in various forms,
but their emergence has been frustrated by the tax code. &quot;Scheduled
benefits&quot; or &quot;defined contribution&quot; plans are rare,
but they provide employees with a broader set of personal options,
particularly in terms of choice of doctors or specialists, than
is commonly found in conventional company-based insurance plans.
The empirical evidence shows that where there is the widest freedom
of choice and the most intense competition among providers and
health insurance options, one finds the lowest costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Among the innovations in the private sector:

<LI><B>The International Paper Company</B> established a &quot;scheduled
reimbursement&quot; plan for its employees based on the median
costs of medical services in the community. After an annual deductible,
the plan reimburses employees for 100 percent of the charges up
to the amount of the scheduled reimbursement. Employees are thus
encouraged to choose wisely among medical providers. The result:
 International Paper saw no increase in medical costs in 1994
and 1995. 
<P>
<LI><B>Golden Rule Insurance Company</B> established a medical savings
account for its employees, along with a catastrophic health insurance
plan, as an alternative to traditional health insurance plan offered
by the company. Over 90 percent of the employees participated
in the MSA option. Under this option, whatever employees do not
spend, they keep. The result:  In 1994, Golden Rule employees
had approximately $1,000 per person left over in their accounts,
and the company's insurance premiums have been flat. 
<P>
<LI><B><i>Forbes</i> magazine</B> started a cash bonus system for employees
who refrained from filing unnecessary health insurance claims.
The result:  The company has lowered its health care costs by
25 percent since the inception of the program.
<P>
<LI><B>Coors Brewing Company</B> established a &quot;wellness,&quot;
or health promotion program, for its employees in 1981. The result:
 The company has saved an estimated $1.9 million annually by decreasing
its medical costs, reducing sick leave, and increasing productivity.
</UL>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress thus has an opportunity to improve the Medicare system
as well as re-establish Medicare on a firm financial footing.
At the same time, taxpayers should understand that failure to
do so will have a profoundly negative economic impact on working
families:  High payroll taxes will have to be imposed just to
sustain the current level of Medicare spending. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In discussing the need for Congress to reform Medicare, the Medicare
Trustees call for &quot;prompt, effective and decisive action&quot;
because &quot;under the present financing schedule for the Hospital
Insurance program, it is sufficient to ensure payment of benefits
only over the next 7 years.&quot;<sup>4</sup>  Beyond inevitable tax increases
on working families, the failure to reform Medicare also has broader
negative economic consequences. According to Martin A. Regalia,
Chief Economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the tax increase
needed to save Medicare would bring the economy to the &quot;brink
of recession.&quot;<sup>5</sup>  The Chamber's study concluded that the Medicare
payroll tax would have to be raised from the current level of
2.9 percent to 6.42 percent. This would have the effect of lowering
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) $179.4 billion within two years,
a decline of 3.1 percent, thus threatening the national economy
with a recession. Employment levels would be cut 1.5 percent.
For a typical worker earning $30,000 a year, the Medicare tax
would be $1,928 instead of the current $876.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Barring huge tax increases, Congress must import free-market principles
of consumer choice and competition into the antiquated Medicare
system. Otherwise, costs will always be just one step ahead of
financial disaster. If Congress fails to reform Medicare, not
only will the hospitalization trust fund face a shortfall, but
the drain on the federal treasury will increase, taking critical
funds away from other federal priorities and programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reconciling House and Senate versions of Medicare reform, Congress
therefore must make the right decisions in reforming the program.
The experiences of the private sector, to the extent that consumer
choice and competition are vital operating principles, can provide
Congress with solid lessons for improving Medicare and eventually
adopting overall reform of the American health care system.
<P>
<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTH PLANS</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a free market, informed people make rational choices among
competing services. History shows that the free market creates
the best products at the best price.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most Members of Congress appear to favor the reconstruction of
Medicare on the basis of the market principles of consumer choice
and competition. For this very reason, the private, employer-based
health insurance system is an inherently flawed model. The reason:
 The market principles of consumer choice and competition are
severely frustrated by the tax-related distortions that exist
in employer-based insurance, and, in many cases, consumer choice
is a precious market principle that appears in truncated form
or not at all.<sup>7</sup>  Generally, American consumers of health care services
do not make the key decisions over the financing and purchasing
of those services; these decisions are reserved, in many cases,
exclusively to corporate benefits managers or employers. As a
result, the consumers of health care services, including health
insurance, and the customers for health care services are different
personalities with different, and often conflicting, economic
incentives:  Employees want high quality health care, and employers
want to protect their corporate bottom line. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Historical Accident.</B> These peculiar patterns exist nowhere
else in the American economy. They are an accident of history,
not the product of congressional deliberations over the kind of
health care financing and delivery systems Americans should have.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before the Second World War, most health care was purchased out
of pocket, and costs were in line with general inflation. With
the outbreak of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress
put the national economy on a war footing and imposed wage and
price controls throughout the economy. Labor could not bargain
for higher wages, and business could not compete for labor under
the Roosevelt Administration's wage and price guidelines. To rectify
this compensation problem, the IRS, with the support of Congress,
established the principle that health benefits would be counted
as compensation which would be exempt from the standard wage and
price guidelines and tax-free. As a result of these major tax
policy decisions drafted under wartime conditions, the United
States developed a unique system of tax-supported employer-based
insurance, which in effect amounted to prepaid medical care, exclusively
supported by the federal tax code through the place of work. Employers
bought health insurance tax-free, and employees consumed health
insurance tax-tree. This new system of &quot;third-party payers&quot;
separated employees' decisions to use health care services from
the economic consequences of their use of health care. With the
development of first dollar coverage, it is not surprising that
many American employees have come to look at health insurance
as a &quot;free good,&quot; or a beneficial &quot;add on&quot;
that simply comes with a good, solid, high-paying job. Worse,
many think that the employer's contribution to their health benefits
package is the employer's money and not their own, thus failing
to realize that increases in health care benefits packages are
a trade-off for decreases in wages and other compensation. The
central economic problem with this arrangement is that on the
demand side of the economic equation (the employees' demand for
medical services through the third-party payment system) as well
as on the supply side (the supply of medical services by doctors
and hospitals), there was no incentive to control costs. Thus,
especially in the 1960s with the advent of the giant government
health insurance programs, costs began to grow at a rate greater
than inflation. As out-of-pocket health care spending declined
and third-party payment assumed a greater share of the purchases,
national health care costs increased. From 1960 to 1993, out-of-pocket
costs dropped from 56 percent to 20 percent. For each 10 percent
decrease, the national expenditure for health care, as a percentage
of Gross Domestic Product, increased 2.4 percent.<sup>8</sup>  With the nation's
elderly coming under Medicare in 1965, a government third-party
system with the addition of taxpayer subsidies, and even higher
rates of utilization, health costs skyrocketed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Medicare has changed little in design over the last 30 years,
its growth rate has accelerated much more than the general levels
of inflation. Taxpayers can look for continued acceleration, largely
because of the rapid aging of the American population.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although restricted by federal tax policy that separates insurance
consumers from customers and health care costs from the consequences
of consumer decisions, private employer-based health insurance
has made some significant and positive changes in the financing
and delivery of services. Experience shows that these different
health care options result in very different costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following is the cost control performance of several types
of private plans in 1994.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The cost is per employee and covers employees, dependents, and
retirees.
<P>
<b>TABLE</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(Data in the table above are from a stratified random sample drawn
by Foster and Higgins from the Dunn and Bradstreet database of
private firms to assure a statistically valid sample in eight
company size categories. The Census of Governments was used to
draw a sample of state, county, city, and local governments. A
weighted scheme was used to combine the results and create one
database. The last two options are such a small part of the 1994
market that they did not appear in the larger random study. The
companies with these plans were contacted directly by the author
to obtain cost information.)
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs include both employer and employee costs. During this
same time frame, Medicare costs were $4,360 per person. Even given
the actuarial disparities between the older, retired element and
the younger, working element of the American population, the difference
is significant:  Medicare costs per person were $500 more than
the most expensive coverage for employees and their dependents
in the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Degrees of Freedom.</B> Information and choice are possible
on two levels. Corporate benefits managers and employers can choose
at a system level between medical groups and between insurance
plans. Or, at the level of individual service, patients can compare
costs and benefits of different plans or choose among doctors
or hospitals. Obviously, there is greater scope for market pressures
where more detailed and frequent choices can occur. It is therefore
relatively easy to rank the prominent private-sector options on
an index that includes consumer choice, information, the level
of competition, and the financial consequences that follow from
individual choices. This free-market index, with the actual costs
in each of these systems, is calculated in the chart that follows:
<P>
<b>TABLE</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Members of Congress can evaluate the specific provisions of the
House and Senate bills reforming the Medicare system in accordance
with their conformity to free-market principles of consumer choice,
competition, and openness to new information. If legislative provisions
increase consumer choice, competition, and availability of information,
the likely consequence is a decrease in cost. If they decrease
consumer choice and competition, then these provisions will likely
increase costs, either directly or indirectly. On the one hand,
premium caps or price controls (as found in the House bill, for
example) are classic mechanisms to shift costs to consumers in
non-controlled sectors of the health care economy. On the other
hand, House proposals to allow seniors the opportunity to choose
both providers and plans, and to reform antitrust laws so that
competitive new systems can be developed, should increase market
efficiency. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicare reform also should establish a user-friendly framework
for new information systems available to doctors and patients,
as well as organizations or associations serving the needs and
interests of senior citizens. In a reformed Medicare system, the
federal government should not intrude into every aspect of the
financing and delivery of medical services; it should establish
the ground rules of a free market and a level playing field for
different types of health care options, with individuals and private
organizations working together to make informed decisions. When
Congress mandates coverage beyond a basic minimum (as it does
in the House bill) or resorts to price-fixing, both the flexibility
and the efficiency of market-based reform, with its promise of
high quality health care at a reasonable price, are compromised.
The inevitable result:  increased costs and decreased availability
of different or innovative medical services. 
<P><h2>
PATTERNS OF PRIVATE-SECTOR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<P>

<B>Experience #1:  Using Managed Care </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Complete choice of doctors is one of the main strengths of the
current Medicare system. Seniors generally value their ability
to choose their own doctors and correctly fear any change that
would block that choice.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One way private employers have responded to the increasing costs
of employer-provided health insurance is by limiting this choice
for employees and their families. Managed care arrangements such
as HMOs and preferred providers allow patients to choose from
a limited number of providers. Companies and corporations, through
insurance firms, have negotiated tough bargains with doctors,
hospitals, and other &quot;providers&quot; to lower costs. In
this sector of the economy, as penetration of the market by HMOs
increases 1 percent, costs have decreased 1.14 percent.<sup>9</sup>  In recent
years, the number of workers covered by managed care firms has
increased dramatically. Today, some 66 percent of all workers
are now covered by such managed care arrangements (see Chart 1).<sup>10</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Currently, HMOs are rapidly increasing their market share by offering
premiums that rise more slowly than other health care models so
that costs initially decrease and grow more slowly than in traditional
indemnity programs. Two features of private-sector managed care
experience are emerging. First, the amount HMOs actually spend
on medical care is decreasing, but insurance premiums continue
to rise. As noted in Chart 2, KPMG has reported that although
the annual growth rate of premiums has been 6 percent to 8 percent,
the costs of providing actual care decreased from 82 percent of
premiums in 1990 to 75 percent of premiums in 1994.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, according to Bernstein Research Associates, the largest
HMOs spend less than 70 percent on actual care (see Chart 3).
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the employer shift to managed care has had an enormous
impact on the financial position of the managed care industry.
The HMO industry alone had pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion in
1994.<sup>11</sup>  Many managed care companies use this capital to consolidate
their holdings and expand their share of the employer-based health
insurance system. Indeed this process is accelerated by state
health care reform proposals based specifically on the &quot;managed
competition&quot; theory, which is designed to promote geographically
based networks of managed care companies and increase the government's
regulatory control over the new &quot;managed market.&quot;  As
Heritage Foundation analysts and others have argued, &quot;managed
competition&quot; leads to even more government control over the
health care system and the likely concentration of the market
in the hands of large, geographically based health insurance cartels.<sup>12</sup>
 In other words, there is more management, less competition, and
greater levels of regulation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minnesota, for example, has adopted and recently modified a major
health care reform proposal based originally on &quot;managed
competition.&quot;  Minnesota COACT (Citizens Organized Acting
Together), a grassroots organization that has evaluated health
care in Minnesota, finds that consolidation has occurred to such
an extent that just four vertically integrated managed care companies
now provide 80 percent of the medical care for Minnesota residents.
It points out that the latest studies of cost by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) and Physicians Payment Review
Commission (PPRC) found that Minnesota's health care costs are
now 5 percent above the national average.<sup>13</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, COACT is concerned about heavier provider workloads,
decreased health care quality, and the undue political influence
of new networks on health care policy decisions made by the state
legislature. The Basic Health Care Action Group, composed of 22
large corporations in Minnesota, also is concerned over the economic
concentration of insurance power in the state and is planning
to contract outside these networks beginning in 1997. Given the
penetration of HMOs into private-sector insurance around the nation,
it is important to remember that while their initial bargaining
power helps curb costs, these cost savings are blunted as their
economic control increases. It is no surprise that a state's insurance
system can be dominated by a few strong companies, thus rendering
it an oligopoly.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;HMOs control costs by reducing the use of services. Staff model
HMOs (those HMOs that actually have doctors on a payroll) reduce
services by nearly 20 percent according to a February 1995 CBO
evaluation of managed care.<sup>14</sup>  Most studies indicate that people
in reasonably good health do well in HMOs.<sup>15</sup>  Preventive care may
even be better than in fee-for-service plans. But a Rand Health
Insurance Experiment found that individuals who were low-income
and in poor health when they entered the study had more serious
symptoms, more bed-days due to poor health, and a greater chance
of dying if assigned to the HMO.<sup>16</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second longitudinal study in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles
followed 1,208 chronically ill patients with hypertension, diabetes,
heart disease, depression, or a combination of these problems.
The patients were divided into fee-for-service or prepaid care
groups (HMOs or IPAs). Those in the prepaid group had improved
coordination of care but reduced physician continuity and a less
comprehensive level of care. More patients reported organizational
access difficulties, such as problems obtaining emergency care,
or problems seeing a doctor when they thought they needed one,
with the prepaid plans.<sup>17</sup>  Another study of home health care services
reported that outcomes of home health care are superior for Medicare
fee-for-service patients when compared with Medicare HMO patients.<sup>18</sup>
 So chronically ill, older patients may not do as well with traditional
HMOs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #1 for Congress.</B> In terms of private-sector experience
with managed care, the lesson for Congress is that managed care
plans often generate initial savings but do not guarantee long-term
control of health care costs. Moreover, in terms of quality care,
their record is mixed. As with any health care delivery option,
there are excellent plans and poor plans. Managed care plans often
provide superior preventive medicine and often are excellent options
for persons in reasonably good health. While they are enormously
popular with private-sector employers, they may not be the best
option for low-income individuals with poor health. This means
that Congress should be neutral in devising a defined contribution
for Medicare and should avoid any government contribution or statutory
provision biased in favor of managed care at the expense of other
private health care options for the elderly.
<P>
<B>Experience #2: Scheduled Benefits. </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of paying their workers' health care compensation in the
form of a standardized, defined set of benefits, or limiting their
choice of doctors or access to medical specialists through a company-based
managed care arrangement, other companies have limited their contributions
to a specific dollar amount while simultaneously encouraging complete
freedom of choice in selecting doctors and medical specialists.

<P>
<B>Example:  International Paper. </B>Perhaps the best example
of this approach is International Paper Company, headquartered
in Memphis, Tennessee. A <I>Fortune</I> 500 multinational producer
of paper and forest products with 52,000 U.S. employees in 44
states, International Paper considers employee choice vital to
its success in curbing health care costs.
<P>
Like so many other large corporations faced with runaway increases
in employee health care costs during the 1980s, International
Paper began to introduce standard cost sharing, with employees
paying larger premiums and copayments. Like many other companies,
it shifted from traditional first dollar coverage to an 80/20
ratio, a standard employer and employee cost-sharing arrangement.
That arrangement, in terms of the company's bottom line needs,
failed to solve the problem, so International Paper tried managed
care-type plans, as most companies are doing today. Although these
plans clearly restrict choice, increased health care costs were
so overwhelming that the managed care option was especially appealing
to the company. But International Paper's experiences were similar
to many others examined by the U.S. General Accounting Office,
the investigatory arm of Congress.<sup>19</sup>  As with so many other companies,
despite an initial decrease in the cost of health care insurance,
the rate of growth soon erased any savings. In fact, it took International
Paper just two years under its HMO plan to reach previous cost
levels.
<P>
In 1990, International Paper's corporate leadership conducted
an innovative pilot project for a new plan that maintained full
employee freedom to choose providers but used &quot;scheduled
reimbursements.&quot;  Their scheduled reimbursement plan, the
brainchild of Jerry Bowers, one of their employees, is designed
to help employees become more knowledgeable consumers of health
care by giving them a meaningful financial incentive to seek out
doctors and medical specialists who are both effective and cost-efficient.
The company's &quot;scheduled reimbursement&quot; is a set amount
for a medical service that is based on median costs for that service
in the community. In other words, the contribution is geographically
based. After an annual deductible, the plan reimburses the employee
for 100 percent of charges up to the amount of the scheduled reimbursement.
Under a separate arrangement, to cover medical catastrophic events,
the plan also pays 100 percent of &quot;usual and customary&quot;
charges, the traditional insurance reimbursement of physicians
under fee-for-service arrangements, after an employee reaches
an annual out-of-pocket maximum.
<P>
For International Paper Company, the results of this financing
arrangement have been dramatic. For employees who shifted from
the 80/20 plan in 1991 to the scheduled reimbursement plan in
1992, total medical costs per employee (including out-of-pocket
expenses) actually declined a total of 12.5 percent. That was
a savings of 14.5 percent for the company and an average savings
in out-of-pocket costs of 5.7 percent for the employee. During
1993 the cost remained largely steady, even in the face of large
cost increases for the company's more traditional 80/20 managed
care plan. International Paper, using the scheduled benefits plan,
did not have increased medical costs in 1994 or 1995.<sup>20</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #2 for Congress. </B>The lesson is clear:  Americans
can have the same or superior quality of health care and enjoy
more choice at less cost. Instead of restricting the market principles
of consumer choice and limiting choice of physicians to control
costs, International Paper has employed consumer choice to control
costs directly, with significant savings to the company and to
employees. The key is putting dollars directly in the employees'
(patients') hands. As is true of all other purchases in a market
economy, consumers indisputably are much more careful with their
own money than with someone else's. The positive experience of
International Paper clearly demonstrates the economic effectiveness
of a defined contribution approach. Its application goes beyond
Medicare to broader health care reform, including the principle
of direct tax relief in the form of tax credits and vouchers for
individuals and families.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The market experience of International Paper can also provide
a model for the &quot;look back&quot; mechanism to control Medicare
costs to meet budgetary targets. Congress is considering an across-the-board
cut in rates, as Medicare has done in the past, to guarantee this
objective. The problem with this solution is that non-discriminatory
providers who are overpricing services will be hurt a little,
but providers who are pricing wisely will be hurt even more. It
is a perverse system of rewards and punishments. The consequences
of the market must be real. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A better model for value, and a solid basis for budgetary control,
is the &quot;scheduled benefits&quot; model, another variant of
the &quot;defined contribution&quot; model, developed by the International
Paper Company. With this model, which pays up to the median cost,
prudent providers will be rewarded with more business and overcharging
providers will not be paid more than is reasonable. International
Paper, in using this principle, is spending $1,000 less than the
average fee-for-service program while still offering complete
choice of doctors. Its experience proves that normal people, given
information and a reason to use that information, can control
costs and make wise health care decisions
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #3: Medical Savings Accounts. </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medical savings accounts are another new method of health care
financing that puts the power of the dollar directly in employee
hands. The current tax laws do not allow company-based medical
savings accounts to be set up so that individuals may contribute
to them with pre-tax dollars. But companies can contribute pre-tax
dollars for the employee and can purchase a back-ended catastrophic
health care insurance plan.
<P>
<B>Example: Golden Rule. </B>While relatively new in concept,
the medical savings account model is used by about 1,500 companies
nationwide. Plans vary widely. Perhaps the most famous example
is the one developed by Golden Rule CEO Patrick Rooney and used
by managers and employees of the Golden Rule Insurance Company,
based in Indianapolis, Indiana. At Golden Rule, the company deposits
$2,000 for family coverage into a medical savings account (MSA)
to pay for routine medical expenses, even those traditionally
not covered by insurance, such as eye glasses or medication. There
is a catastrophic health care insurance policy purchased by the
company with a $3,000 deductible. This costs $1,862 per year for
family coverage. The savings account covers the first $2,000 of
the deductible; if needed, the additional $1,000 is out of pocket.
What employees do not spend on doctors, they get to keep. In 1994,
this amounted to about $1,000 per person in leftover funds. Golden
Rule's premiums have not risen since the plan was offered to employees.
Over 90 percent of the company's 1,100 employees participate in
the plan and are highly satisfied. The Luntz Research Company
has reported that 98 percent of Golden Rule employees are satisfied
with the MSA and 88 percent prefer it to past plans. Actual costs
for the Golden Rule Company are about $2,900 per family, which
includes the catastrophic policy and the actual $1,000 spent from
the MSA fund.<sup>21</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cautionary note is provided by the Morris County Hospital in
Council Grove, Kansas. It had a medical savings account-type program
from 1983 to 1992. At first it worked well. But in the seventh
year, the total work force increased 25 percent and there was
a huge employee turnover. Medical spending below the deductible
increased 44 percent in just one year and another 27 percent the
following year. For the first seven years, the increase had been
only 3.5 percent per year. The large increase was thought to be
caused by failure in employee education. In the last three years,
the employees, especially new ones, thought the fund was a &quot;free&quot;
benefit, and spending increased dramatically. The hospital then
converted to a traditional indemnity policy.<sup>2</sup>  The message is clear:
 For MSAs to provide the savings that are needed, they must be
structured correctly. However companies may design the medical
savings account option, their experiences generally show lower
costs with MSAs than with traditional indemnity policies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen Barchet, M.D., an expert on health policy based in Washington
State, reports actual costs for seventeen different plans in the
current <I>American Compensation Association Journal</I>. An examination
of the data provides a clear picture of the potential success
of Medical Savings Accounts (see Chart 4). 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Each of these examples shows the financial impact of consumer
choice of physicians and other medical specialists. But consumer
choice of plans still is not a predominant feature of private,
employer-based health insurance. Since the private sector operates
on the basis of a third-party payer system, consumer choice of
doctors and other medical specialists is a matter of corporate,
rather than consumer, decision. The company may choose from groups
of doctors or other providers who agree to lower costs or capitate
payment (the HMO or preferred provider model). This lowers cost
but decreases the patient's choice, including the choice of a
doctor. The evolution of employer-based insurance presents a major
challenge to the traditional doctor-patient relationship, so fundamental
to the ancient ethical imperative of the medical profession itself.<sup>23</sup>
 In the International Paper Company's &quot;scheduled reimbursement&quot;
or &quot;defined contribution&quot; model, consumer choice of
providers is encouraged, and the employee is rewarded directly,
not only with a revitalization of the traditional doctor-patient
relationship, but also with the personal economic benefit of choosing
value for money.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the most dramatic development in health care financing
in recent years is the medical savings account. Once considered
a marginal contribution to health care reform efforts, MSAs have
become politically popular and are finally getting the theoretical
attention they merit from the health care policy community. The
American Academy of Actuaries, in attempting to estimate average
costs nationwide for MSA plans, reports that costs will depend
ultimately upon three critical variables. First is the existing
distribution of health care costs. Eighty-five percent of insurance
claims today are below $3,000, so a $3,000 deductible policy should
cover 85 percent of possible charges. The second factor is utilization.
The Academy says that this depends largely on the amount that
must be out of pocket in the insurance policy. The last factor
is perhaps the most important:  whether users of the medical savings
account option consider the MSA balance as insurance or savings.
At Golden Rule, for example, it clearly is savings for the employee,
since what is not spent is received by the employee in cash rebates.
Because of these variables, the American Academy of Actuaries
says that total expenditures for health care per individual could
be a band of costs ranging from $2,695 to $2,976 using an MSA
model.<sup>24</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #3 for Congress.</B> While medical savings accounts
hold great promise, it is essential for Congress to design them
correctly. Specifically, Members should make sure the patient
using the account understands that the money is his money and
he receives the direct financial benefit by spending it wisely.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #4: Private Competition in the Public
Sector.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A third model is one with which Congress already is intimately
familiar:  the right of an individual to choose among various
private health care plans, well beyond the range of choice afforded
by private companies choosing between health care plans. This
model is illustrated uniquely by the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular system with almost 400 private
health care options competing for the business of Members of Congress,
congressional staff, federal workers and retirees, and their dependents
 roughly nine million Americans. The Heritage Foundation, the
American Medical Association, and several other prominent institutions
and organizations, have suggested that Congress should use the
FEHBP as a basic model in reforming Medicare.<sup>25</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the FEHBP, individuals are offered private insurance options
once a year. No other class of Americans enjoys the choice of
plans and benefits available today to federal workers and their
families. For all practical purposes, federal workers and retirees
can do something that most Americans cannot even imagine:  choose
the kinds of plans and benefits they like at prices they wish
to pay. There is no government-standardized benefits package,
but a wide variety of benefit options. There are no set copayments
and deductibles, but a wide variety of copayments and deductibles.
The government offers federal workers and retirees a contribution,
fixed by a formula, for any plan they choose. The government contribution
is about 72 percent of the cost of premiums. If these consumers
wish to pay more, they may do so. If they buy a less expensive
plan, they can pay less, and thus take advantage of the savings
from picking less expensive health care options. As a model for
Medicare reform, the FEHBP is important also because 40 percent
of its policyholders are retirees and therefore represent an older
workforce compared to the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result of consumer choice and competition in the FEHBP is
a solid performance in controlling health care costs, especially
in recent years. For 1996, according to the Office of Personnel
Management, the federal agency that oversees the program, the
projected overall increase in premiums is only four tenths of
one percent. Premium growth for the past three years has been
essentially flat.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The role of the federal government in the FEHBP is to make sure
that plans offered are sound. The government does not actually
run a plan, as in the Medicare system, or even in the reformed
Medicare system envisioned in House and Senate legislation. It
simply ensures that all plans are solvent and meet standard marketing
and consumer protection requirements. The law creating the FEHBP
does not outline a system of standardized benefits like Medicare's;
nor does it standardize co-payments and deductibles as Medicare
does. And, of course, there are few Medicare-style price controls.<sup>26</sup>
 The law merely lists the categories of benefits, such as hospitalization
and physicians services and outpatient services, that plans must
offer; the health plans themselves, responding to OPM's call for
negotiation on rates and benefits each year, largely determine
the health benefits they want to offer without OPM's trying to
micromanage the process.<sup>27</sup>  From the standpoint of administration,
the program is comparatively simple. Washington economist Walton
Francis compares FEHBP and Medicare:  &quot;The FEHBP is run by
150 government bureaucrats. Medicare is run by more than 3000
bureaucrats (neither of these numbers include people paying claims).
To be sure, Medicare serves three times as many people, but FEHBP
runs three times as many plans (counting Medicare's 100 participating
HMOs).&quot;<sup>28</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Within the FEHBP, there are two persistent problems, both aggravated
by federal government policy. The first is &quot;adverse selection,&quot;
the tendency of younger and healthier people to migrate to lower
cost plans, leaving older and sicker workers in high-cost plans.
This has been a special problem for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans in the program. In recent years, this problem has abated:
 &quot;More recently, the risk segmentation has stabilized, in
the sense that the high risk groups have separated so that high
risks are in the high option plan with high premiums, and the
low risk predominate in the standard option with lower costs.
In fact, for awhile the Blue Cross plan was required to increase
its premium even more in order to create greater reserves in anticipation
of high claims. Thus, the spiral has slowed, but the pricing issue
remains.&quot;<sup>29</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the adverse selection problem may have abated in recent
years, it remains, but persists only because of congressional
insistence on a crude form of community rating. Retirees and active
workers pay the same premiums regardless of age. Since older workers
have higher health care costs, private plans competing in the
FEHBP market cannot price for those differences, offsetting the
risks of enrolling older and sicker workers by charging them higher
premiums. This problem could be resolved by allowing plans to
underwrite on the basis of age, sex, and geography, at the very
least treating retirees and active employees differently, and
offsetting the resultant increase in retiree premiums with an
increase in the government contribution for retiree health care.
This might not save money, but it would minimize the adverse selection
problems the federal government created in the FEHBP market. FEHBP's
current government contribution formula, based on the premium
performance of the six largest plans participating in the program,
is also an odd political artifact. According to the Clinton Administration,
if federal workers and retirees were under a defined contribution
formula not unlike that being proposed for Medicare, rather than
the current FEHBP financing arrangement, they would be ahead in
compensation by $424 million in 1996 alone.<sup>30</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second problem is the regulatory potential of OPM to undermine
market forces and frustrate consumer choice and competition by
restricting options, mandating benefits that workers or retirees
may not want, or dropping specific benefits that federal workers
may want. The FEHBP has no flexible spending account or medical
savings account options, and OPM historically has been biased
against allowing high-deductible insurance plans to compete in
the system. While OPM has played largely a passive role in FEHBP
administration, to the general benefit of the program, this could
vary with presidential administrations.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #4 for Congress.</B> Congress should treat the elderly
like congressional retirees and make available to citizen retirees
a degree of choice equal to or superior to the level of choice
available to retired Members of Congress and their spouses. Moreover,
Congress should introduce improvements in the design of a consumer
choice system in Medicare that would lessen the problems of adverse
selection and forestall the kind of government regulatory interference
which frustrates consumer choice and competition in the FEHBP.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #5: The Use of Cafeteria Plans and
Flexible Spending Accounts.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Within the private sector, there is a limited version of the consumer
choice found in the FEHBP. Currently, one of four American workers
has some degree of choice in selecting benefits. Over the past
25 years, 250,000 employers have turned to flexible benefit plans.<sup>31</sup>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;TRW, the aerospace industrial giant, and the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, New Jersey, both claimed to have started
the first cafeteria plans in 1974. Congress encouraged this corporate
policy by establishing flexible benefits accounts under Section
125 of the Internal Revenue Code in 1978. Under this section,
employees can deposit otherwise taxable cash compensation into
a pre-tax account for the purchase of benefits. But employees
cannot roll this account over tax free from one year to the next.
Nevertheless, the option has become very popular, particularly
among large corporations. According to an analysis conducted by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 48 percent of employers
with 1,000 or more employees offered flexible spending accounts
in 1991 for health care.<sup>32</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Cafeteria plans, flexible benefits options, and flexible spending
accounts have been successful in controlling costs. Employers
have realized that by allowing employees to choose their benefits,
making decisions based on value for money, they have been able
to control overall costs. According to the Employers Council on
Flexible Compensation, while average medical claims costs for
all employers rose by approximately 15 percent in 1992, costs
for those with flexible plans rose by 11 percent.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #5 for Congress. </B>As the private sector experience
with cafeteria plans and flexible benefits shows, increased consumer
choice means increased cost control.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #6: Using Private Associations.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American cannot get tax relief for health insurance unless
it is purchased through an employer. Thus, most Americans are
covered by employer-based plans. Yet, despite the tax discrimination
against them, non-employment health insurance plans continue to
exist. If private association plans were on a level playing field
with traditional insurance plans, their market share could be
enormous. Indeed, in a reform of the general health insurance
market of the sort suggested by The Heritage Foundation and others,
they could be a perfect way to address the problem of many uninsured
Americans. It is noteworthy that in the FEHBP, where there is
a level playing field, about one-third of all workers and retirees
choose plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Already, over six hundred private associations, organizations,
and groups provide health insurance for their members.<sup>34</sup>  They range
from professional organizations like the Alabama Oilmen's Association,
American Society of Travel Agents, Colorado Grain and Feed Association,
and Independent Garage Owners of North Carolina to fraternal,
legal, and political organizations like the Association of the
United States Army, B'nai B'rith, Federal Bar Association, and
National Organization for Women. Many medical and health care
groups also have plans:  the American Dental Hygienists, American
Academy of Family Physicians, American Society for Microbiology,
and many more.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the attractions of association or organization plans is
that they combine a professional or fraternal interest with health
care concerns of their members. The Golf Course Superintendents
Association of America and National Sash and Door Jobbers Association
may not have much else in common, but they do offer health insurance
to their members. Religious institutions and labor unions also
have a potentially beneficial role in this area. Indeed, the stronger
the personal affinity of consumers with these organizations, the
more likely these institutions will be to emphasize consumer protection
and information.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #6 for Congress.</B> Members of Congress have personal
experience with being able to join health plans sponsored by groups
with which they have an affinity. Numerous associations, unions,
and organizations now offer health insurance in the private sector.
They should have the opportunity to market solid plans in the
Medicare system as well.
<P>
<h2>THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to control cost most effectively, consumer choice requires
informed consumers. Nowhere is the need for solid information,
for consumers as patients and doctors as providers of health care
services, more evident than in a reformed health care market.
While consumers need solid information on plan options, and the
prices and benefits available to them, doctors and hospitals and
medical specialists in a new consumer-based market will have a
continuing need for up-to-date information, including clinical
and scientific data, on the treatment and cure of disease, as
well as cost.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The good news is that the information explosion, a post-industrial
revolution that promises to improve the quality of life and the
efficiency of America's economic system, is shattering the traditional
way doctors and patients interact with one another:  &quot;Patients
are interviewing physicians, hiring and firing them.&quot;<sup>35</sup>  At
the same time, the information superhighway is an avenue of information
on specific illnesses where patients can exchange information
on treatments, physicians, and outcomes. America Online, Prodigy,
and CompuServe already are providing such services to American
consumers. Moreover, through the Internet, consumers can get access
to federal health documents and databases.<sup>36</sup>  While the information
revolution is well underway, it is straining the capacity of corporate
structures of delivery and intensifying the internal contradictions
between an information age that is inherently compatible with
personal freedom, consumer choice, and competition and older,
paternalistic systems of health care delivery in which the patient
is on the receiving end of somebody else's decisions. The contradiction
is nicely articulated by Dr. Catherine De Angelis of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine:  &quot;It's crazy. On the
one hand you're raising expectations and raising the level of
understanding of patients regarding disease process or illness,
and on the other hand corporate medicine is forcing physicians
to just crank out patients. You don't have the time to respond
to patients.&quot;<sup>37</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While managed care may be the latest evolution of &quot;corporate
medicine,&quot; it is managed care that has contributed to the
very information explosion that is taking place in a rapidly changing
private sector. Perhaps the most important contribution of managed
care has been its intense concentration on the actual costs of
providing medical care. In the recent past, insurance reimbursement
for doctors and hospitals often was &quot;usual and customary&quot;
or &quot;cost-plus&quot; reimbursement. In a system without consumer
pressures to control cost, this type of arrangement is a natural
incentive to drive up costs. Moreover, until recently, even with
closer attention to the problems of administration and overhead,
hospitals did not always have the software used by manufacturing
companies in their production process  software that would enable
them, for example, to look at the actual cost of each step in
the process of treating or caring for patients. Given the incentives
of the predominant third-party payment system and the cost-shifting
that is rampant in the health care sector of the economy, hospital
bills that include $10 for an aspirin should not seem shocking.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>An Existing Network.</B> For congressional and federal employees
and retirees, the consumer information infrastructure for the
informed purchase of health insurance plans is already in place.
Beyond the personal experience of shopping for the best value
for money in the FEHBP insurance market, there is a vast network
of public and private information on health insurance plans, including
the level of benefits and the quality of care and medical services.
Approximately one half of all people with health insurance in
the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area are covered by the FEHBP's
35 competing plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the Office of Personnel Management publishes a comparative
FEHBP &quot;Guide&quot; to private health insurance plans, that
effort is supplemented by a variety of other information sources,
including advice to employees from federal agency personnel managers;
newspaper articles outlining comparative plan benefits; television,
radio, and newspaper advertisements; federal union and employee
association information campaigns; and even town hall programs,
sponsored by Members of Congress with large numbers of federal
employees and retirees in their districts, outlining the best
offering for the coming year. The National Association of Retired
Federal Employees (NARFE), which describes all FEHBP plans as
&quot;good,&quot; publishes a booklet comparing plans and benefits
for retirees, even describing which plans provide the best treatments
of interest to this age group. Perhaps the most widely quoted
information source is <I>Checkbook's Guide to Health Insurance
Plans for Federal Employees</I>, published by Washington Consumers
Checkbook, which outlines all of the plans in the FEHBP, including
information as to which will be better for certain medical conditions.
Everyone from government couriers and janitors to postal workers
and senators use this information to choose health care plans
yearly. Where only the employers make choices, the cost control
has not been as impressive.<sup>38</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just as enrollees in FEHBP get solid information on different
insurance plans, employees of the International Paper Company
get solid information on the cost of services and qualifications
of local providers. Relying on consumer choice and promoting the
availability of such information, International Paper experienced
no increase in costs for three years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>New Consumer Information Technology.</B> With the limited exceptions
of the FEHBP and companies that provide a degree of consumer choice
through flexible spending accounts and medical savings accounts,
there is no broad consumer choice in employer-based insurance.
But the technology for giving consumers even more information
on the price and performance of providers already is well underway.
One innovative approach is the proposed R.E. MEDI system developed
by Dr. Jack Tawil, an economist and President of Research Enterprises
of Richland, Washington, Inc. R.E. MEDI is a software system that
can accumulate and present all of this diverse information on
price and performance in a simple format. Each patient has a computer
disk, protected by an individual password, that contains medical
information and cost data. Access to the main memory bank is effected
by an access code, just as is done with a bank teller card. When
the patient goes to the doctor, the code handles electronic billing
in a quick, efficient manner and records the cost of the visit
in the central system. The central computer system gathers all
of the charges from multiple patients and then produces a comparison
of physician charges. This has enormous potential application
for companies and systems (International Paper, for example) trying
to bring down the cost of health care through consumer choice
and competition among providers. Beyond price information, the
R. E. MEDI system also collects treatment outcomes and provider
qualifications. This gives each patient access to a periodic publication
of price, performance, and qualifications.<sup>39</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Hospital and Physician Information.</B> Largely because of
the economic pressures exerted by new managed care arrangements,
doctors and hospitals need precise cost information. The actual
number of hospitals that have effective, decision-directing cost
analysis is not known. The estimate by companies which produce
such software is around 15 percent.<sup>40</sup>  Those hospitals able to use
such software have dramatically improved their ability to provide
better care at lower costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach,
California, has lowered patient costs and improved hospital profits
by using a data system called the &quot;Affinity Program.&quot;
 The hospital used the computer to generate information in a clinical
pathway. The steps were to find a process to improve; organize
a team of physicians, nurses, and staff; understand the variations,
such as length of stay; plan the improvement; implement improvement;
check results; and revise. From 1990 to 1994, the hospital lowered
its charge per case of  Coronary Bypass (DRG107) from $55,418
to $42,093 (24 percent) and its charge per case of total hip replacement
(DRG209) from $20,793 to $18,688 (10 percent).<sup>41</sup>  The implications
for the nation are staggering. This is not an isolated case. For
example, in 1993, the average charges for another coronary procedure,
transluminal coronary angioplasty, ranged from $16,770 in Ohio
to $28,110 in Colorado.<sup>42</sup>  Using the &quot;affinity program&quot;
for this procedure, Hoag Memorial has reduced its charges to $12,650
for coronary angioplasty. And the hospital has increased its profit.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beyond price, however, is the sheer explosion in biomedical research
and technology. Biomedical sciences, including anatomy, biochemistry,
microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology, at the
125 medical schools all over the United States are in a period
of tremendous growth. Beyond this academic complex, private biomedical
research and technology firms are making progress on many fronts
 everything from AIDS and Alzheimer's disease to cancer and cardiac
devices. At least 90 percent of the nearly $5 billion spent in
1992 on research and development has come from private-sector
investors. And since it takes seven to ten years, under current
regulatory timelines, most biotech companies must seek successive
rounds of financing. Most of the nation's 1,300 biotech companies
are small start-up businesses with a powerful entrepreneurial
spirit. More than three quarters have fewer than 50 employees,
and most are less than ten years old. More than 50 percent of
their costs are research and development.<sup>43</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, some of the companies fostering new health care breakthroughs
are providing information about the cost impact of their products
in addition to their medical usefulness. American Biogenetic Sciences
Inc. is such a firm. It is conducting clinical trials of a new
test, called the Thrombin Precursor Protein, which could save
billions of dollars.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Cardiovascular diseases rank as America's number one killer. The
cost of cardiovascular disease in 1995 is estimated by the American
Heart Association at $137.7 billion. Much of that money is spent
on the treatment of patients who present themselves to emergency
departments with symptoms of chest pain. All such patients must
be treated as if they are having a heart attack until heart attack
can be ruled out. Approximately eight million Americans present
themselves to emergency departments annually with symptoms of
a heart attack, but only 20 percent actually are having an attack.
This creates many hospital admissions and procedures which could
be prevented if doctors could diagnose accurately at the time
they first see the patient. According to Dr. Paul Gargan, the
firm's research expert, the new test will detect a blood clot
that causes a heart attack immediately after chest pain begins.
Current tests pick up evidence of heart muscle damage at 12 to
24 hours after pain begins. The new test, pending FDA approval,
would make immediate diagnosis possible for the first time.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American Biogenetic Sciences calculated the amount Medicare patients
could save just by using the new test to screen patients before
admitting them to coronary care units. According to the firm,
the amount saved by using the test in this way alone would be
$130 billion during the next seven years.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, there are new &quot;clot-busters&quot; that actually
may reverse the heart attack process and prevent heart damage
if doctors give them in the first two hours after the onset of
an attack. Since it has been very difficult to tell who is having
a real heart attack, and since these &quot;clot-busters&quot;
have rare but serious side effects (like strokes), doctors have
not been able to use them as much as they would like. With a new
test that accurately makes the diagnosis, doctors should be able
to save many lives and prevent heart damage that leads to chronic
heart problems in many more. This new technology could offer impressive
new methods of prevention and thus reduce the unnecessary long-term
costs and effects of cardiovascular conditions.
<P>
<h2>NEW MODES OF COMPETITION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Traditional market competitiveness  either between health insurance
plans as in the FEHBP or between doctors and other providers as
at International Paper  lowers costs. For Members of Congress
engaged in reforming Medicare, the private sector has suggested
new models that promote competition.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Total systems of care like HMOs offer a complete range of services.
Theoretically, a complicated patient can receive better care if
all the care is coordinated. In the private sector, there is a
trend toward larger and larger HMOs. The larger companies spend
less on actual care, and large companies are charging about 30
percent above health care costs. That means the same care perhaps
can be given at lower cost to the consumer. Smart providers looking
at these numbers have suggested that provider networks, organizations
run directly by doctors, could give the same or better care at
lower cost by decreasing management costs. The problem has been
that antitrust laws prevent more than 30 percent of doctors in
a community from joining in such a provider network, even on a
non-exclusive basis (they also provide care outside the network).
The HMO could have 100 percent of the doctors in the same community
in its network, however, and be perfectly legal. The American
Medical Association recommends that the Department of Justice
and Federal Trade Commission develop guidelines that allow physician-sponsored
coordinated care organizations to operate on an equal footing
with traditional HMOs. The House bill provides for such physician-sponsored
organizations. Final congressional guidelines should permit greater
numbers of physicians to join in networks and should define financing
structures that recognize physician services as a financial asset.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other provider networks have offered new plan designs that should
give better care to specific groups. One such group is older people
with chronic medical problems. For example, Wesley Woods, an Atlanta,
Georgia, senior citizen care facility, reports that 30 percent
of its residents have mental difficulties. It is very difficult
for them or their families to handle all the paperwork of traditional
Medicare. New systems that would coordinate all needed care with
one capitated payment would make this much easier. The director
of Wesley Woods supplies a case study illustrating the point.
Mrs. B is over 70 years old. She lives in an apartment and is
low income. She has a long history of chronic mental illness,
but that problem is managed when she is on medication. Under the
current Medicare system she does not always receive her medication.
When that happens, she hears voices, accuses neighbors of threatening
behavior, and becomes a police problem. Her behavior problems
lead to eviction, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, and
discharge. This pattern recurs every two years at a current cost
of about $27,000 per cycle. A new provider network would permit
quarterly psychiatric visits and a weekly psychiatric nurse visit,
and would cover her medication at a cost of $4,400 per year. Even
better, Mrs. B could stay in her own home.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
<B>Using Consumer Incentives</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whenever the copayment in fee-for-service plans is increased,
over all costs and utilization decrease.<sup>46</sup>  When a policy increases
the financial consequences of the consumer's decisions, the consumer
uses it more carefully. This principle underlies &quot;defined
contribution&quot; plans like that of the International Paper
Company. This has implications for broader health care reform,
including reform of the Medicare system. If a person wants to
spend more for health care than the company provides, he assumes
the extra cost, utilization of care is decreased, and costs are
controlled.
<P>
<B>Example: <I>Forbes</I> magazine.</B> <I>Forbes</I> magazine
illustrates a more direct effect of using financial incentive
to control costs. With its cost-sharing plan, costs were decreased.
But <I>Forbes</I> did not achieve maximum cost savings until it
initiated a plan whereby employees received bonuses for not filing
insurance claims. Employees may receive a bonus of $1,500 if they
do not file any insurance claims. For claims up to $750, the amount
below $750 is doubled. For example, if an employee files a claim
for $300, the difference would be $450 and the bonus to the employee
would be $900. <I>Forbes</I> also pays the extra taxes on the
bonus for the employee. <I>Forbes</I>, not surprisingly, has lowered
health care costs by 25 percent since initiating this program.<sup>47</sup>
<P>
<B>Encouraging Wellness</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historically, company-based programs focused on preventive medicine,
health care promotion, and wellness have been uncharacteristic
of private employer-based insurance. But this is changing. As
more and more companies seek to control health car costs, they
are relying upon such methods as preventive health care programs
emphasizing diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes.
<P>
<B>Example: Coors Brewing Company.</B> One of many companies encouraging
wellness among its employees, Coors Brewing Company opened a wellness
center in July 1981. James R. Terborg, a professor at the Graduate
School of Medicine at the University of Oregon, conducted a cost
benefit study of this program. He found that for every dollar
invested, the company saved $6.15 and estimated that the program
saved the company at least $1.9 million annually by decreasing
medical costs, reducing sick leave, and increasing productivity.<sup>48</sup>
 One very clear example of this is the cardiac rehabilitation
program. Coors officials provide a free, comprehensive cardiac-rehabilitation
program to employees, spouses, retirees, and dependents recovering
from cardiac illnesses. The program's main object is to return
employees to work in their original jobs as quickly as possible.
To date, 98 percent of employees have completed the program and
returned to work in about 1.3 months. The national average is
70 percent and eight months, respectively. Many of these Coors
employees were able to assume their original jobs, and the program
has saved a total of more than $3.5 million in lost wages and
$2.6 million in actual costs overall. Coors pays $662 per patient
for the cardiac rehabilitation program, but the average external
cost of such a program is $1,700.<sup>49</sup>  In addition, Coors offers special
incentives to employees to develop and maintain healthy behaviors.
For example, nonsmokers pay 50 percent less for supplemental life
insurance than smokers do.
<P>
In January, Coors adopted a flexible benefits package that allows
employees to earn up to $250 in additional benefit dollars, as
well as $250 for spouses, when they make these six wellness pledges:
 to abstain from tobacco; to consume alcohol responsibly; to use
safety equipment, such as seat belts and helmets; to assume responsibility
for their mental health by promising to seek counseling for stressful
situations; to stay physically active; and to have their blood
pressure checked every six months. Employees are on their honor
to keep these pledges, and Coors deducts the benefit dollars they
earn from their insurance premiums.
<P>
<B>Example: Quaker Oats Company.</B> Quaker Oats Company also
has developed a positive incentive wellness program. Employees
who exercise three times a week, use seat belts, use no tobacco,
and promise no drug or alcohol abuse earn $150 annually in flexible
benefit credits. Employees who take and meet the company's Health
Risk Appraisal earn an additional $110 in flexible benefits. The
positive cash incentives and emphasis on wellness have resulted
in a reduction of almost 50 percent in hospital admissions over
ten years.<sup>50</sup>
<P>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Members of Congress can learn a great deal from the experience
of the private sector, particularly the innovations of America's
corporations. While the private sector's employer-based, third-party
payment system is far from an ideal model of a normal market,
it has responded rather quickly, if imperfectly, to cost pressures
and introduced genuine innovations in the financing and delivery
of health care. Using advanced computer systems, making information
more available to employees and promoting wellness, and using
flexible spending accounts and medical savings accounts, corporations
and private businesses have accumulated ample experience in controlling
costs. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress changed the tax treatment of health insurance and
levelled the national playing field, giving equal tax treatment
to employment-based and non-employment-based health options, the
competition would be intense and the private system even more
flexible. Organization and association plans sponsored by fraternal
and religious institutions, unions, and employee organizations
would likely flourish. But a free market with real consumer choice,
intense competition, and access to solid information through America's
emerging network of information superhighways can reduce costs
even more while providing Americans with even higher levels of
quality health care. While the interaction of all these forces
may seem complex, a simple relationship is evident. The closer
a system is to a free market, the lower are the costs of that
system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What applies to the innovative firms in the private sector and
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program applies also to
Medicare:  A market provides the best service at the best price.
It is characterized by choice, information, and competition. Americans
deserve this kind of health care system.

Table 2 -- <a href="fyi67b.gif">The Impact of an Additional 3.52% Medicare Payroll Tax By Amount of Tax</a><br>
<p>
If an unreformed Medicare program is to be able to pay the hospital bills of today's workers when they reach retirement, industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors and consumers. In addition, workers will face additional annual costs of at least $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages. These costs will be the result of the additional payroll taxes, on top of current payroll taxes, needed to assure long-term fiscal solvency of the cash-strapped Medicare hospitalization trust fund if no reforms are enacted. The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience indicates that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation.1  Moreover, the cost of stabilizing the hospital trust fund is only part of the necessary burden if reforms are not implemented. To cover the rising costs of Part B, which covers physicians' costs, Congress would have to raise taxes even further.<p>The current financial status of Medicare is precarious. Without significant structural reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt. For Medicare to remain financially solvent and legally able to pay for hospital care for today's "baby boomers" when they retire, Congress needs either to find additional money for the hospital trust fund or to slow down its rate of spending.
<P>
<b>Trustees' Tax Options.</b> The seven members of Medicare's Board of Trustees have determined that the Medicare Hospitalization (HI, or Part A) Trust Fund that finances hospital services for the elderly will be insolvent by 2002. In addressing the tax question, the trustees have outlined three possible options to solve the financing problem if no structural reforms are enacted:  a short-term option of an immediate 1.3 percent additional payroll tax, needed to keep the hospital program solvent for 25 years; an intermediate option of a 3.52 percent payroll tax, needed now to make the hospital program permanently solvent; and a high-cost option of a 3.9 percent payroll tax, needed if no action is taken until the actual depletion of the Medicare trust fund in seven years.2  For purposes of econometric analysis, the authors of this study used the trustees' intermediate option of a 3.52 percent payroll tax, under which Congress, rather than adopt structural changes in the program, would keep Medicare basically the same and finance the same level of benefits and projected costs through tax increases. Under this scenario, the trust fund would be able to pay for hospital care for the foreseeable future, not just for the next 25 years.
Under this option, an additional tax of 3.52 percent of taxable payroll would be "shared" between employers and employees. According to earnings data by industry taken from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>, the total yearly cost of this additional HI payroll tax would have been $123 billion, or about two percent of Gross Domestic Product, had such a tax gone into effect in 1993. On average, using an 88 percent "pass through," and had the tax increase been in effect in 1993, the combined direct tax and indirect wage loss to employees would have been about $862 per employee, for a total cost to employees of $115.7 billion (out of the $123 billion).3<P>The amount of new tax not paid directly by employees or indirectly passed through to them would take the form of additional costs to customers and investors. The analysis delineates the impact by industry of a 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax. Overall, using the 88 percent "pass through" effect on employee wages and compensation, and had the tax been in effect in 1993, industry would have $7.4 billion to pass on to consumers and investors, rather than to employees. If the tax were imposed now, that number could be much larger because of the growth in earnings since 1993.
<p>
Retail trade, educational services, and public administration would be the hardest hit by such a tax, together shouldering nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers, and investors. The retail trade industry alone will have to pass at least $800 million on to customers and investors, with educational services and public administration passing on $542 million and $487 million, respectively.
<P>
Unlike the private sector, public-sector employers do not have the luxury of passing on costs such as additional Medicare payroll taxes to customers and investors. Taxes must be increased or programs cut to pay for whatever costs are not passed on to employees in the form of reduced wages and compensation. Moreover, taxpayers potentially could fund a larger share of the burden of the additional payroll tax than customers and investors in the private sector since government pay scales and contracts could restrict their ability to pass on additional costs to employees.

<p>
<b>APPENDIX <br>
COST CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS</b><br>
<p>
<b>Cost of HI Tax by Standard Industrial Classification Code</b><br>
The national aggregate of employee earnings by industry was derived from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. These earnings are for 1993. The cost calculations assume the payroll tax increase had been in effect that year; the normal growth in earnings means that the payroll tax and its associated costs would be higher in 1996 and subsequent years.
<p>
Due to the nature of self-reported income surveys, the CPS generally underestimates earnings. In order to develop a multiplier to adjust the CPS-reported earnings, we compared the CPS total with the national employee and proprietor earnings reported in the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> table on national income in 1993 (as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <i>Survey of Current Business</i>, April 1994).
<p>
After April 1986, all state and local employees were required to pay Medicare taxes. In 1991, however, the law was amended to allow those hired before that date to opt out. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that as of March 1994, 1.7 million workers were not covered by Medicare. Using the 1.7 million figure, we removed the exempt workers and their earnings from each industry class based on the distribution of state and local government employees in each category according to the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>.
<p>
Based on a survey of economic literature estimating the "pass-through" wage effect of employer mandates by health care econometrics firm Lewin-VHI, we assumed 88 percent of the cost of the additional tax to be passed on to employees in reduced compensation. We also assumed that the pass-through had fully occurred. Therefore, we assumed the total cost of the additional Medicare tax to employees to be 88 percent of the business's share of the Medicare tax (about 1.56 percent) in addition to the 1.76 percent tax on wages paid directly by the employee. 
<p>
The cost of the HI tax to customers, investors, and taxpayers is the remaining 12 percent not passed through to employees.
<p>
Note on "Children."  The <i>Current Population Survey</i> classifies all wage earners under the age of 15 as "children."  Because these workers, who include such individuals as young farm workers, are not officially considered part of the labor force, the CPS does not collect specific industry information on these wage earners. The CPS, however, does not collect income data for wage earners under 15, and so in reality the wages identified by CPS for "children" category are the results of miscoding by CPS and actually accrue to wage earners aged 15 and above. These miscoded wage earners and their employers do pay the HI payroll tax on reported income. Thus they are included in this analysis under the separate, non-industry-specific category of "children" used by the CPS.

<title>FEHBP Controls Costs: Lessons for Medicare Reformers</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>FEHBP CONTROLS COSTS AGAIN: 
MORE LESSONS FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit </a><br>
Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies<br>

F.Y.I. No. 64<br>
September 25, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

	While Members of Congress wrestle with the problem of how to fix the nearly bankrupt Medicare program, they will not be worrying about the future of their own health care system. Even those Members planning to retire next year have no cause for concern. The reason:  Beginning on November 13 and running through December 11 of this year, these same Members of Congress, along with millions of federal workers, retirees, and their dependents, will have a unique opportunity to pick the private insurance plan and combination of health benefits they think best for them for next year. Retiring members will continue to enjoy this privilege. They can do this because they are enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular, 35-year-old, consumer-driven system with almost 400 private health plans competing nationwide. 
<p>
	<b>Broad Choice.</b> Unlike Medicare beneficiaries, who are locked into an inflexible government-standardized benefits package, these special Americans enjoy a broad range of consumer choice practically denied to all other Americans. For these enrollees in the FEHBP, there is even more good news:  Not only can they pick and choose from a wide variety of private plans, with a variety of prices and benefits, but they also can pocket the savings that result from wise choices. 
<p>
	<b>Cost Control.</b> While Medicare costs are soaring at 10.5 percent per year, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal agency that runs the FEHBP, recently trumpeted to Members of Congress and congressional retirees the good news that next year they can look forward to insignificant premium increases, and that many will see no premium increases at all. "Employees and retirees shopping for health care coverage in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for 1996," declares OPM, "will find a total average premium increase of only four tenths of one percent, compared to an average private sector premium increase of more than six percent over a comparable period."1  For this year, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent, and in 1994 they rose just 3 percent.<p>	<b>Government Help.</b> Under current law, the government contributes about 72 percent of the cost of the premium of any private plan that Members of Congress and congressional and federal retirees choose. If, in any given year, these consumers wish to keep their private plans, they do not have to do anything. If they wish to change their plans and get better value for their dollars, they may do so. Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees may wish to remain in more expensive plans because they think that a richer set of benefits or a more attractive combination of benefits is worth the cost to them. Next year, according to OPM, federal employees and retirees will see an average biweekly increase of just 44 cents for self-only coverage and only $2.25 for family health insurance coverage. Over 25 percent of enrollees will not experience any rate increase in 1996.2<p>	<b>Solid Information.</b> The federal government assists Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees with a financial contribution toward the purchase of their plan and with unbiased information on various plan offerings. This information is supplemented by helpful information from private-sector organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available to workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality, and price. For congressional and federal retirees, the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE), a major organization representing over 500,000 active and retired personnel, suggests the best plans for those needing specialized medical services. <i>Washington Consumers Checkbook</i> even rates plans according to comprehensive patient surveys to help FEHBP enrollees pick plans.
<p>
	While reforming Medicare, Members of Congress should keep in mind key lessons from their own experience in the FEHBP. 
<p>
	<b>LESSON #1: Consumer choice and competition control costs, even in an insurance pool comprised of older workers and a disproportionate number of retirees.</b> Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. Surprisingly, the FEHBP is not an ideal insurance pool, with a large number of younger, healthier workers cross-subsidizing a much smaller group of older workers and retired personnel. Instead, the federal workforce is significantly older than the private-sector workforce; the average federal worker is 43.8 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is 37.7 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily over the past several years. And while private firms are reducing and even eliminating retiree health benefits, approximately 40 percent of all subscribers in the FEHBP are retirees,3 helping to make the total insurance pool itself progressively older. Most federal retirees today have access to the Medicare system as a result of changes in the Social Security law in 1983, but approximately 200,000 still rely on FEHBP plans as their primary health insurance. Nonetheless, even retirees with Medicare coverage are more costly to the system than active federal workers. 
<p>
	The FEHBP has demonstrated a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent. 
<p>
	<b>LESSON #2: Federal workers and retirees would have enjoyed even greater personal savings in the FEHBP if Congress had guaranteed federal workers a defined contribution, indexed to inflation, instead of relying on the current government formula.</b> Today, the federal government contributes to the cost of each private plan chosen by Members of Congress, federal workers, and retirees. The maximum dollar amount contributed by the federal government is set legally by a formula which requires OPM to calculate the government contribution on the basis of the average premium of the six largest plans in the program:  the "Big Six" formula. Current law also specifies that the federal government can contribute no more than 75 percent of the premium cost of any given plan. This means that, in any given year, the government's contribution will vary, depending upon the OPM staff's negotiating skills and the annual premium performance of the six largest plans in the program. One proposal advanced by Heritage scholars to reform the FEHBP, and also incorporated in this year's Congressional Budget Resolution, is to replace the Big Six formula with a clearly defined annual dollar amount for individual and family coverage.4 This is similar to the voucher proposal for Medicare now being considered by Congress. <p>	Future increases in that dollar amount would be based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Private plans competing directly for the dollars of federal workers and retirees thus would have a powerful incentive to offer attractive packages of benefits at a price at or even below the fixed dollar amount, thereby reducing the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increasing their savings even more. Competition among private insurance plans would intensify, and federal workers would get to pocket any difference between the defined contribution and the actual price of a plan. With the elimination of the existing 75 percent cap on the government contribution, workers who picked lower cost plans would not be penalized by any reduction in the dollar value of the government's contribution, and those who picked higher cost plans would not be rewarded by the government. 
<p>
	<b>Lost Compensation.</b> If the defined contribution rule had been in effect in recent years, federal workers and retirees generally would have done better financially than they do under the current formula. In any case where FEHBP's premium performance dipped below the Consumer Price Index beyond any other savings achieved through careful choice of plan, federal workers and retirees would have experienced a gain in overall compensation. For example, under the current formula, the maximum government contribution for 1996 will be $3,432.26 for family coverage and $1,599.26 for single coverage. Under the 1996 Congressional Budget Resolution establishing a defined contribution, the federal government's contribution would be $3,547 for family coverage and $1,587 for single coverage.5 <p>	Under such a defined contribution arrangement, federal workers and retirees would be able to pocket the difference between the defined contribution and the cost of any plan. Given recent premium performance, they would have fared better under a clearly defined dollar contribution over three of the last five years:6<p>	Such a change in FEHBP financing to establish clear and predictable increases in the government contribution would allow federal workers, retirees, and their families to take full advantage of any positive changes in the competitive market for insurance.
<p>
	Moving from a defined benefits to a defined contribution system would be a good deal for federal workers and retirees. Such a change also makes sense for the Medicare system. The FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs.

F.Y.I. No. 58: Apples and Apples

<h2>Comparing Apples With Apples On Medicare</h2>
<h3>By <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/butler.htm ">Stuart M.  Butler</a></h3>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies
</center>
<hr>
<p>
The White House and congressional Democrats have attempted in recent weeks to draw a stark distinction between the Medicare savings projected in the House-Senate Conference Budget Resolution and President Clinton's budget plan, released in June.  Americans are being told that while the President's plan seeks to achieve only $128 billion in savings over the next seven years, the Conference Budget Resolution seeks to achieve $270 billion in savings.  Hence, the impression is created that Congress intends to reduce projected Medicare spending by more than double the amount favored by the White House.
<p>
The facts are quite different.  Because the "baseline" used by the White House is different from the one used by Congress, the comparison made by the White House is the numerical equivalent of comparing apples with oranges.  When the same baseline is used, the savings desired by each end of Pennsylvania Avenue turn out to be much closer.
<p>
A baseline is a projection of spending under current law, using assumptions about utilization, growth of the eligible population, and other factors.  There are savings in a Budget Resolution or a White House budget if the spending targets in the budget document are below the baseline.  Obviously, the level of saving will depend on who develops the baseline and what assumptions they use.
<p>
The reason the White House greatly exaggerates the difference in projected savings between the Administration's plan and that of Congress is that the White House uses a Medicare baseline developed by its own Office of Management and Budget, while Congress uses the baseline developed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (which "scores" all budget-related legislation). 
<p>
Even small differences in assumptions can make a significant difference in a baseline.  For Medicare Part A, for instance, the CBO projects an average annual cost growth of 7.9 percent over the next ten years, while the OMB projects the rate at 7.5 percent.  For Part B, the CBO expects a 12.3 percent growth rate, while the OMB projects only a 10.9 percent growth rate.
<p>
Because the OMB baseline projects a lower rate of Medicare spending under current law than the CBO projects, the savings achieved by any particular budgeted amount for Medicare would seem lower using the OMB baseline instead of the CBO baseline (or, in Washington parlance, a Medicare "cut" looks smaller using the OMB baseline). 
<p>
While there can be a debate about which baseline is a more accurate forecast of Medicare spending under current law, it is clearly very misleading for the White House to use one baseline to score Congress's Medicare plan and another to score its own (especially when that suggests a lower "cut" for the White House plan).
<p>
For Members of Congress and ordinary Americans to compare the two budget proposals, it is thus necessary to provide a comparison using the same baseline.  Doing so, reveals that the projected savings are closer than the White House suggests.
<p>
Using the OMB baseline for the White House plan and the CBO baseline for Congress's plan wrongly implies that the White House wants to reduce future Medicare spending by $128 billion (FY 1996-2002), while Congress intends to reduce it by $270 billion (that is, by $142 billion more than the White House).
<p>
Comparing the two budget plans with the CBO baseline, however, indicates that the White House wants savings of $192 billion, not the $128 billion it claims when comparing its plan with that of Congress.  This makes the difference between the two plans just $78 billion over seven years, not the $142 billion claimed by the White House.  This difference is about half the amount implied by the White House's apples/oranges comparison.
<p>
If the two budgets are compared with the OMB baseline, it is Congress's savings which must be revised down to reflect the lower baseline.  Using this baseline means Congress's savings amount to $205.7 billion (compared with $128 billion for the White House plan, using the same baseline).

<h2>A GUIDE TO MEDICARE REFORM PROPOSALS</h2>
<h3>By John C. Liu<br>
Policy Analyst</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

 When Congress returns from its August recess, it will begin to
consider the future of one of America's most popular entitlement
programs -- Medicare. Much is at stake for Americans of all ages.
<P>
 The Medicare program is in dire financial trouble. According
to the 1995 report of the Medicare Trustees, a seven-member federal
board that includes three Clinton Administration Cabinet members
and two other senior Administration officials, the Hospital Insurance
(HI) Trust Fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002.
The need and urgency for change is succinctly stated: "The
Trustees believe that prompt, effective, and decisive action is
necessary." (1)
<P>
 To avoid the collapse of the program, Congress has only two choices:

<P>
<B> Choice #1</B>: Do not change significantly the way Medicare
is run by the government, and assure future benefits by raising
new revenues through higher payroll taxes and other taxes or by
diverting money from other programs. This means Medicare survives
only by draining money from the rest of the budget or by sharply
raising payroll taxes.
<P>
<B> Choice #2</B>: Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run
so that benefits are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding
future tax increases or a diversion of money from other programs.
This approach would aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated
to grow.
<P>
Several proposals have been put forward in recent months, from
outside Congress, to address the problems of Medicare. During
the August recess, Members and the public can be expected to evaluate
such proposals as they consider what actions should be taken regarding
Medicare when Congress meets to finalize action on the budget.
<P>
 To assist this evaluation, this <I>F.Y.I.</I> summarizes several
of the leading reform proposals. These include plans advanced
by the Clinton Administration, by "think tanks" (the
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, and National Center
for Policy Analysis), by organizations representing the elderly
(the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare
and United Seniors Association), and by major organizations representing
health care providers (the American Hospital Association, American
Medical Association, Federation of American Health Systems, Group
Health Association of America, and Healthcare Leadership Council).
<P>
 This <I>F.Y.I.</I> is intended only to summarize these proposals,
not to evaluate them; as far as possible, documents are quoted
verbatim or paraphrased. Documents used in the summaries may be
obtained from the issuing organizations.
<P>
 While the proposals vary widely in detail, many share common
themes. Only two (the Clinton Administration and the National
Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare) can be described
as leaving the current structure virtually unchanged. The others
tend to emphasize three broad reform themes: 
<P>
<B>1) An option to pick private plans.</B> Virtually all the
reform plans would allow recipients to pick private plans as an
alternative to the traditional Medicare program. Generally this
is seen as a way to improve the quality of care and, by introducing
a much greater degree of consumer choice within a competitive
market, a way to reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending.
Some proposals would permit beneficiaries to choose plans with
benefits that differ from the current Medicare package (Heritage,
American Medical Association), while others would require the
private plans to contain at least the standard Medicare benefits
(Brookings, NCPA). Virtually all would retain the traditional
Medicare program as an option.
<P>
<B>2) A defined contribution.</B> Virtually all the reform plans
would begin to shift Medicare away from an open-ended program
which pays for a set of benefits (a defined benefit) and toward
a program which makes a financial contribution towards the health
costs of a Medicare beneficiary. This is accomplished in several
ways, such as a budgeted voucher payable to the plan chosen by
the beneficiary (American Medical Association, Heritage) or a
payment linked to the growth in general health care costs (Brookings,
NCPA). Like the general option to pick private insurance in place
of traditional Medicare, moving to a defined contribution system
is intended to change fundamentally the incentives in the program,
encouraging beneficiaries to seek better value for money.
<P>
<B>3) The FEHBP as a model for reform.</B> While virtually all
the reform plans propose some form of new or revised administrative
structure to organize and monitor a Medicare market of competing
private health plans, several proposals (American Medical Association,
Federation of American Health Systems, Heritage) adopt as an administrative
model the program currently serving federal workers, retirees,
and dependents. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
(FEHBP) organizes a market of almost 400 private plans competing
for the business of over nine million Americans. (2)<p>

<h4>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following is a summary of the Medicare proposals outlined
by the Clinton Administration on June 13, 1995, when the Administration
unveiled a second budget blueprint. Specific details on the proposal
have not yet been made available.</I>
<P>
 The President's plan to restore the fiscal integrity of the Medicare
trust fund aims to reduce the growth in spending in Medicare Part
A by $79 billion over seven years to ensure the solvency of the
Medicare HI Trust Fund to 2005. These savings are based on the
Office of Management and Budget's projection of Medicare spending
under current law. (The savings to be achieved would be higher
if the Congressional Budget Office baseline is used).
<P>
  The White House plan aims to achieve such savings by reducing
the growth of payments to providers, not by raising beneficiary
costs. In fact, the Administration's proposal reduces the same
beneficiary costs by eliminating the copayment for mammograms.
The White House notes that only 14 percent of eligible beneficiaries
without supplemental insurance schedule mammograms. One factor,
say officials, is the required 20 percent copayment. To remove
financial barriers to women seeking preventive mammograms, the
President's plan waives the Medicare copayment.
<P>
 The President's plan would expand managed care options for retirees
to include variants such as preferred provider organizations (PPOs)
and point-of-service (POS) plans. The plan also seeks to improve
Medicare reimbursement of managed care plans, including a competitive
bidding demonstration proposal. 
<P>
 Finally, the Clinton proposal aims to combat fraud and abuse,
in part through an "Operation Restore Trust," a five-state
demonstration project targeting fraud and abuse in the home health
care, nursing home, and durable medical equipment industries.
The President's budget proposal increases funding for these fraud
and abuse activities.

<h4>AARON AND REISCHAUER (OF THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION)</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a proposal put forward on July 20,
1995, by Henry J. Aaron and Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings
Institution (3). Reischauer until recently was Director of the Congressional
Budget Office.</I>
<P>
 Like other policymakers, Aaron and Reischauer have defined several
goals and principles around which Medicare reform should revolve.

<P>
 First, Medicare reform should encompass the full package of benefits
most Medicare beneficiaries use.
<P>
 Second, "a reformed Medicare program should not result in
the provision of health care to the elderly and disabled of a
quality materially different from that available to the general
population; nor should the delivery system for the elderly and
disabled be segregated from that of the rest of the population
(other than for definable services where medical reasons justify
separate delivery, as with geriatric care)." 
<P>
 Third, "Medicare should create incentives for beneficiaries
to seek care from efficient plans and should encourage physicians
and hospitals to provide care of given quality at lowest possible
costs."
<P>
 Fourth, "Medicare beneficiaries should have a degree of
choice among health plans similar to that enjoyed by the rest
of the population."
<P>
 Aaron and Reischauer believe the current Medicare program should
be converted from a defined benefits program (service reimbursement
system) into a form of defined contribution program (premium support
system). Instead of paying for all services on a predetermined
list, Medicare would pay a defined and set sum toward the purchase
of an insurance policy that provides a defined set of services.
"As with private insurance for the working population, plans
could reimburse any provider the patient chooses on a fee-for-service
basis (the current method Medicare uses for most beneficiaries),
contract with a preferred provider organization, or operate through
a health maintenance organization."  These plans could manage
care in any of the ways they currently practice or adjust as necessary
for changes that may occur in the future. In short, every "Medicare
beneficiary would receive a pre-determined, geographically variable
amount that would be applied toward the purchase of a health plan
providing defined services." 
<P>
 Health plans participating in the new program would be required
to offer a defined set of services. While the new Medicare plan
would not use the current Medicare benefits package as a model,
it would add prescription drug and catastrophic coverage. Aaron
and Reischauer believe that a standard benefits package is necessary
because it will enable enrollees to compare the cost and quality
of the various plans while reducing the risk of instability in
the insurance market from plans altering benefits in an effort
to attract healthier enrollees. 
<P>
<B> Marketing.</B> Health plans choosing to participate in the
new plan (commercial insurance companies, Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans, HMOs, PPOs, non-managed care networks) would be invited
to submit bids on the standard benefit package for the "average"
Medicare enrollee within a particular marketing area. The federal
Medicare contribution to help the enrollee defray the cost of
a plan in each market area would be the same regardless of which
plan the Medicare enrollee chose. To ensure that Medicare enrollees
are well-informed of their various options, local marketing organizations
would be established to handle the sale of insurance and act as
consumer advocates. As in the FEHBP, enrollees would choose a
health plan for the upcoming year on an annual enrollment basis.
<P>
 Health plans would receive risk-adjusted payments from Medicare
based on age, gender, disability status, and other health indicators.
<P>
<B> Premium Contribution.</B> The initial federal payment would
be set at 95 percent of the cost of the current Medicare package
in the enrollee's market area. The size of the payment would be
adjusted to exclude direct medical education, indirect medical
education, and disproportionate share payments. It is projected
that during a phase-in period of five to ten years, the federal
payment would grow more slowly than projected budget baseline
costs. Later, the federal Medicare payment would grow at the same
rate as per capita spending on health care for the non-elderly
population. Aaron and Reischauer contend that while this formula
is somewhat rigid and will require periodic adjustments, it is
more than likely that such an approach will yield appreciable
savings over the projected baselines. The authors believe that
as the competitive marketplace develops and enrollees become more
comfortable with choosing their own health plans, the difference
between the federal payment and the cost of insurance could be
rebated to participants as non-taxable income or shared between
the government and participants.
<P>
 The authors believe that even under the most optimistic scenario,
it will take several years for the necessary institutional infrastructure
to develop and become operational. The authors believe that the
current Medicare system should be run concurrently with the new
choice-oriented proposal. But the new system would be mandatory
for everyone who turns 65 and becomes eligible for Medicare at
a date to be determined. Current Medicare enrollees would have
the option of staying in the traditional program or moving into
the new system.
<P>
 Echoing the sentiments of the public trustees of the Medicare
program, and like the authors of most other plans, Aaron and Reischauer
call for the consolidation of Parts A and B.

<h4>THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes Heritage Foundation <a href= "bg1038.html">Backgrounder No.
1038, "What to Do About Medicare,"</a> by Stuart M. Butler,
Robert E. Moffit, and John C. Liu, dated June 26, 1995.</I> 
<P>
 To control costs while improving value and choices for beneficiaries,
The Heritage Foundation advocates a conversion of the Medicare
program into a system in which the government provides beneficiaries
with a defined contribution that may be used either to purchase
a Medicare-approved private health plan or to remain within the
traditional health care program. This system would be, in effect,
a modified version of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
(FEHBP), which currently makes 400 competing private plans available
to nine million active and retired federal employees and their
family members.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation envisions a new Medicare system structured
much like the successful FEHBP, but with modifications that refine
the government contribution to make the new program even less
susceptible to adverse selection effects that the FEHBP is and
provide beneficiaries with better information on which to make
choices. The new program would have four basic elements:
<P>
 First, elderly and disabled Americans would have an entitlement
not to a defined set of benefits, but to a voucher worth an amount
based on a number of factors. The total federal expenditure for
the voucher system would be limited to a program budget, with
the voucher amount adjusted each year according to the budget.
To achieve the target for Medicare in the congressional budget
resolution, the Heritage Plan proposes that expenditures for the
voucher be permitted to grow 7 percent in the year of enactment
and 5.6 percent each year thereafter. 
<P>
 Second, the base for the voucher amount would be budgeted Medicare
expenditures (combined net expenditures for Parts A and B) divided
by the eligible population. This base would be adjusted up or
down according to three basic categories:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Primary risk factors, including age, gender, reason for eligibility
(age or disability), institutional status, and End-Stage Renal
Dialysis (ESRD) status.
<li>An income adjustment applied to one-third of the voucher, to
be the equivalent of means-testing today's Part B premium.
<li>A local market variance, to reflect the weighted average enrollee
cost of a "basket" of typical plans in any area. This
would permit adjustments to reflect the cost of approved plans
available in the area. This basket would consist of "typical"
plans, such as the Medicare Standard Plan (see below), a catastrophic
/MSA plan, a Blue Cross standard plan, and a comprehensive HMO
plan. This is a refinement of the "big six" formula used by the Office of Personnel Management to set the government contribution to the FEHBP. Since the plans would have to submit detailed information on their prices and benefits before the annual open season, this adjustment would reflect the actual future market
the beneficiary would encounter in the following year.
</ol>
<P>
 Third, in order to be permitted to sell insurance to Medicare
participants, health plans would have to meet certain threshold
requirements. Beyond these, they could offer varieties of benefits
and delivery systems. There would be no restriction on the number
of plans. To be Medicare approved, a plan must:<p>
<ul>
<li>Have a license to issue health insurance in the state or obtain
approval from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

<li>Provide services in a service area acceptable to HHS.

<li>Meet minimum solvency requirements.

<li>Include a core set of basic coverage determined by legislation.
The basic package would have to cover "medically necessary"
acute medical services, including physician services; inpatient,
outpatient, and emergency hospital services; and inpatient prescription
drugs, with a catastrophic stop-loss amount for these services.
A plan thus could offer a much leaner package than today's Medicare
program (although it would have to provide catastrophic protection,
unlike Medicare today), but it could offer a range of services
beyond the base coverage. For example, some plans might offer
dental benefits, or drug coverage, or an MSA. States would be
preempted from mandating additional benefits for plans serving
the Medicare population. The Medicare Standard Plan (see below)
initially would provide the services available today under Medicare
Parts A and B. This Standard Plan would not be required to add
catastrophic protection unless its board chose to do so or Congress
required such a change in benefits.

<li>File with HHS a standardized statement of benefits (exclusions,
copayments); a table of rates for the same actuarial categories
used to determine Medicare benefits (age, institutional status);
and consumer information as determined by a consumer advisory
board. This information might include the results of enrollee
satisfaction questionnaires, turnover rates, average out-of-pocket
costs paid in the previous year by enrollees for the treatment
of certain illnesses, and perhaps ratings by certain organizations.
This price, benefit, and consumer information also would be available
to any Medicare beneficiary upon request.

<li>Accept and continue coverage for any Medicare beneficiary applying
during an annual "open season," or for any newly eligible
beneficiaries, unless the plan receives a waiver from HHS because
of capacity concerns. This requirement would apply to plans marketed
by affinity organizations, such as churches, unions, or elderly
groups, not merely to plans marketed by insurers or provider organizations.
</ul>
<P>
 Fourth, the government's role in the new system would be kept
to a minimum. Under the new program, HHS no longer would be allowed
to regulate the prices charged by providers; instead it would
take on "umpire" functions more like those being carried
out by OPM in the FEHBP system. The government, however, would
have three important roles:
<P>
<ol>
<li>The government would establish a federal corporation, governed
by an appointed board, to run a Medicare Standard Plan similar
to the current Medicare program. The Standard Plan would be available
in all markets, and the board would set premium prices to meet
long-term solvency requirements. Subject to congressional approval,
the board could adjust benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and payment
levels in the Standard Plan.

<li> As an alternative, the Standard Plan could be the traditional
Medicare program, without a set premium and funded directly rather
than by vouchers. While this alternative might have political
advantages, however, the lack of a premium would make it more
difficult for beneficiaries to compare the Standard Plan with
competing private plans.

<li>HCFA would calculate the voucher amount for each beneficiary,
setting that amount after the plans had filed their price and
benefit information for the following year.

<li>HHS would conduct a Medicare open season, much as OPM does for
the FEHBP. Before open season, Medicare beneficiaries would receive
an information kit from HHS, including the amount of their voucher
and standardized information on prices, benefits, and consumer
satisfaction for Medicare-approved plans in their area, including
the Standard Plan. Beneficiaries also would receive a selection
form on which to indicate their choice. Once the selection had
been made, HCFA would send the beneficiary's voucher to the chosen
plan. The beneficiary would be responsible for any difference
between the voucher and the premium costs, but could elect to
have the government pay that difference and reduce his or her
Social Security check (similar to the Medicare Part B option today).
If the voucher amount exceeded the plan's premium, the difference
would be deposited by HCFA into a Medical Savings Account of the
beneficiary's choice. Disbursements from MSA accounts could be
used only for medical expenditures eligible for the Internal Revenue
Service Schedule A tax deduction.
</ol>
<P>
 Under The Heritage Foundation proposal, Medicare would operate
much as the FEHBP serves federal workers and retirees. Medicare
beneficiaries would be able to pick a private plan which included
the services they wanted (beyond the core package), delivered
in the way they wanted and, if they wished, through an organization
with which they were affiliated (as many FEHBP enrollees do).
Or they could decide to apply their voucher to the premium of
the Medicare Standard Plan. Because beneficiaries would receive
a voucher for a specific amount (paid directly to the plan of
their choice), they would have a strong economic incentive to
pick the plan that best met their objectives of price, quality,
and services.
<P>
 The organization of services, selection of benefits, and payments
to providers would be in the hands of plan managers competing
for enrollees. Unlike the federal officials managing Medicare
today, these managers would have the freedom and the financial
incentive to experiment with new ways to deliver care at a competitive
price. The voucher approach would give all plans an incentive
to strive for the best pricing and not consider the voucher as
a floor price.

<h4>NATIONAL CENTER FOR POLICY ANALYSIS</h4>
<P>
<I> Unless otherwise noted, the following summarizes publications
issued by the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.</I> (4)
<P>
 The National Center for Policy Analysis (NCPA) has developed
a proposal to allow "the elderly to withdraw their share
of funds from Medicare, including Parts A and B, and purchase
their coverage from any alternative private source they may prefer." (6)
 These private plans from which seniors may choose include a Medical
Savings Account (MSA), a health maintenance organization (HMO),
or an employer's health plan. Since present and future retirees
would have an option of staying in traditional Medicare or choosing
a private plan, the NCPA proposal "creates new options without
eliminating existing ones."
<P>
 Under the NCPA proposal, the Medicare program would make a payment
to the MSA or private plan of an enrollee's choice to help cover
the costs of care or insurance premiums. The "premium payment"
would be adjusted to reflect the enrollee's age, gender, geographic
location, and health status. Older and sicker enrollees would
receive more financial assistance from the program to purchase
private insurance. 
<P>
 For a private health plan to be eligible to participate in the
new program, it would have to offer a base package, which would
be the existing level of benefits and services currently covered
under traditional Medicare. These plans are not precluded from
offering additional benefits or charging additional premiums to
cover these costs. Private insurers covering Medicare would be
subject to guaranteed issue requirements and would have to provide
coverage to any applicant currently on Medicare, regardless of
health status. A significant aspect of the NCPA proposal is that
private health plans would not be required to accept patients
from other private plans covering Medicare beneficiaries but would
have to accept individuals transferring from the traditional Medicare
program.
<P>
 The NCPA proposal emphasizes the use of Medical Savings Accounts
(MSAs). One of the private options envisioned would be to couple
a catastrophic policy with a Medical Savings Account. Based on
the requirement that all private plans would have to offer the
current Medicare package as a minimum package, all catastrophic
policies would have to offer the same services currently in Medicare.
Contributions to an MSA would be applied against medical expenses
under the particular catastrophic plan's deductible. In addition
to the Medicare contributions being deposited into an MSA, retirees
could direct further deposits to the MSA beyond the payment made
on their behalf by Medicare. While additional funds that are contributed
to the MSA would receive no tax relief, the interest build up
and subsequent withdrawals for health expenses would be tax-free.
The NCPA proposal requires that during a 12-month insurance period,
MSA funds be used only for medical expenditures. However, funds
remaining at the end of the year could be withdrawn tax-free for
any other purpose as well. 
<P>
 The NCPA proposal is intended to slow Medicare's rate of growth.
One option offered by NCPA is to cap the rate of growth as determined
by congressional budgetary targets. Another option would be to
set the growth rate "equal to the rate of growth of private
sector spending on the theory that working taxpayers should not
have to bear the burden of Medicare taxes growing at a faster
rate than their own private health insurance."  A possible
mechanism to achieve this reduction in growth, besides the cost-reducing
incentives created by the voucher mechanism, would be to raise
the current deductible level for Medicare beneficiaries in addition
to increases in copayment-payment fees for services. Low-income
households would be exempted from these increases under the NCPA
proposal.

<h3>RETIREE GROUPS</h3>
<P>
<h4>NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes testimony presented by the organization's
President, Martha McSteen, on July 19, 1995, before the House
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.</I>
<P>
 The National Committee believes that the Medicare program has
been a "remarkable success story" and that the private
market's record on coverage of individuals and cost containment
is inferior when compared to Medicare's. The provision of vouchers
to the nation's elderly and disabled to purchase private insurance
is "a type of reform which may well undermine Medicare and
threaten the health security of seniors and the disabled."
 The National Committee is opposed to allowing the nation's elderly
the choice of opting out of the current Medicare program and choosing
a health insurance plan on the private market. While increasing
choice is acceptable to the National Committee, such choices must
be within the current Medicare framework of a defined set of standardized
benefits.
<P>
 The National Committee supports the following principles/proposals
which it believes would secure Medicare's long term stability.
It is the Committee's belief that if all its proposals are enacted
into law, savings of $150 billion in the Medicare Part A Trust
Fund would occur and the rate of growth in Medicare Part B spending
would slow. Specifically, the National Committee calls for Congress
to:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>Adopt</b> certain elements of the Clinton Administration's budget
proposal. President Clinton proposes to save $10 billion over
five years by making permanent several temporary provisions in
current law, including the setting of Part B premiums at 25 percent.
Other provisions include extending Medicare secondary payer provisions
and permanently lowering payments to home health agencies and
nursing homes.

<li><b>Extend</b> Medicare coverage to state and local government employees.
This is expected to raise $7 billion over five years. 

<li><b>Increase</b> the tobacco tax. The National Committee supports an
increase in the tobacco tax to $2 per package. This would raise
$15 billion a year for Medicare Part A, in addition to $1.5 billion
for medical research.

<li><b>Reevaluate</b> Medicare payments for hospital capital costs and graduate
medical education. The National Committee believes that a reevaluation
could save between $7 billion and $23 billion over five years.

<li><b>Reduce</b> payments to hospitals for outpatient surgery and radiology.
According to a recent HHS study, payments to hospitals for outpatient
surgery and radiology have been excessive because of the formula
for determining such payments. Savings of $20 billion over five
years can be realized, says the National Committee, if a change
to the formula or payment structure is made. Such savings should
be directed toward lowering beneficiaries' copayments for these
services.

<li><b>Introduce</b> stricter utilization review and a streamlining of Medicare
administrative costs. While the National Committee believes that
Medicare has an excellent record on administrative costs, averaging
two percent of program outlays, it believes that further reforms
can improve on this success, including the combining of Part A
and Part B.

<li><b>Increase</b> the eligibility age. The National Committee supports
increasing the eligibility age for Medicare by tying it to eligibility
for Social Security benefits. While the rationale behind such
a proposal is to procure savings in the federal budget, no figures
or estimates were provided by the National Committee in its testimony.

<h4>UNITED SENIORS ASSOCIATION, INC.</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a publication issued by USA, Inc.,
entitled "A Proposal for Reform:  Resolving the Medicare
Crisis."</I> <6>
<P>
 The United Seniors Association is an organization voicing the
sentiment of senior citizens from across the country who support
the American free enterprise system. Unlike the other national
organizations purporting to advance the interest of seniors, USA,
Inc. does not receive federal funding to lobby Congress. USA,
Inc. has put together the following principles it believes should
guide Medicare reform. 
<P>
<b>First</b>, there should be no tax increases. Therefore, the current
HI payroll tax of 2.9 percent should not be raised. Increases
are unnecessary, says USA, Inc., because revenues from this source
would increase over time as the rate of growth for household incomes
increases. 
<P>
<b>Second</b>, Medicare premiums should not be allowed to increase at
a rate faster than the rate of general economic growth. USA, Inc.
believes this would protect the elderly from facing a potentially
large increase in future premiums, which could happen under current
law.
<P>
<b>Third</b>, USA, Inc. calls for synchronizing eligibility for Medicare
benefits with the retirement age for Social Security. Under current
law, the retirement age for Social Security benefits is to rise
from 65 to 66 between 2000 to 2005, and from 66 to 67 between
2011 and 2022. Thus, under the USA, Inc. plan, future retirees
would not be eligible to receive Medicare benefits until these
later ages.
<P>
 While future expenditures would be reduced, no estimate is provided
of how much the federal government would save. 
<P>
<b>Fourth</b>, USA, Inc. actually proposes to raise the retirement age
sooner and push back the eligibility age even further. Under the
proposal, the retirement age would be delayed three months for
every year starting in 1996, until it reached 70. The rationale
for this change is that longer life expectancies, coupled with
the pending retirement of the baby boomer generation, will produce
a heavy strain on the Medicare program under the current financing
scheme. USA, Inc. believes that keeping individuals privately
insured until age 70, using a combination of employer-provided
insurance and previous savings, would help alleviate the financial
pressures facing the HI trust fund and the overall Medicare program.
<P>
 Fifth, any reform of Medicare must include a restructuring of
the benefit package. Specifically, the Medicare benefit package
must conform to the resources available to finance the program.
Under the USA, Inc. proposal, the Medicare benefit package would
be adjusted annually so that the program does not spend above
the revenues coming in from the HI payroll tax, Part B premiums,
and general revenues (taxes). 
<P>
<b>Sixth</b>, the USA, Inc. proposal calls for an expansion of Individual
Retirement Accounts for retirement medical purposes. This proposal
allows every individual to contribute up to $1,000 per year to
an IRA. While these contributions would be subject to applicable
taxes, the interest would accumulate tax-free and withdrawals
after age 65 would be tax-free for medical and non-medical expenses.
The impact the proposal would have on the federal deficit and
the budget is not estimated. 
<P>
<b>Finally</b>, health insurance vouchers would be provided to the elderly
population below the poverty level.

<h3>PROVIDER GROUPS</h3>
<P>
<h4>AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes testimony before the House Ways and
Means Committee on July 19, 1995, by Richard Davidson, President
of the American Hospital Association.</I>
<P>
 The American Hospital Association includes in its membership
some 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks, and other
providers of care. While the AHA has not come forward with a concrete
legislative proposal, it has testified before the various congressional
committees with jurisdiction over Medicare. The AHA has outlined
four principles that it believes Congress should adopt in reforming
the Medicare program: <p>
<P>
<ol>

<li>"Change the delivery system to encourage more use of coordinated
care  -- cooperating groups of hospitals, doctors, and others
who knit the fragmented delivery system together for patients
and have powerful incentives to control costs."

<li>"Change the process by which Medicare benefit and funding
decisions are made."

<li>"Make sure all stakeholders absorb spending reductions."

<li>"Ensure access to high-quality health care for the nation's
most vulnerable populations -- the elderly, poor and disabled."
</ol>
<P>
<B> Changing the Delivery System.</B> According to the AHA's testimony,
"The key is to restructure Medicare to encourage more use
of coordinated care. Coordinated care is working in the private
sector, and it can work in Medicare as well."  The AHA believes
that higher utilization of coordinated care will result in improved
quality because an entire network of providers will be held accountable
for a patient's care. Furthermore, coordinated care networks emphasize
preventive care, and this leads to reduced costs. 
<P>
 Some examples of changes in the delivery system endorsed by the
AHA:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the types of plans that Medicare beneficiaries can choose.
Among other options, according to the AHA, Medicare should contract
with the growing number of non-managed care networks that also
meet high standards for quality and public accountability and
are able to offer a full range of services for a pre-determined
premium. Under the AHA approach, these non-managed care networks
would share the risk with the Medicare program.

<li><B> Providing seniors with more information on health care plans.</B>
Sending the elderly an annual report that compares coordinated
care (managed care and non-managed care) plans and fee-for-service
plans on the basis of quality, cost sharing, premiums, deductibles,
and benefits will enable them to make sound and informed decisions.

<li><B> Allowing for open enrollment on an annual basis.</B> The FEHBP
allows all federal employees to choose their own health insurance
plans each year. The AHA wants Medicare-eligible patients to be
given the same opportunity. The federal government makes a fixed
maximum contribution toward the health plan of an employee's choice,
and the AHA believes Medicare should do the same for its beneficiaries.

<li><B> Eliminating barriers that discourage creation of coordinated
care networks</B> by inhibiting provider cooperation -- the heart
of coordinated care. For example, the AHA wants Congress to:
<P>
<ol>
<li><B> Modify the physician self-referral law.</B> While the original
goal of deterring physicians from referring patients for unneeded
services based on financial arrangements remains valid, it is
overreaching in today's environment. The physician self-referral
law, says the AHA, is as an impediment to hospitals, physicians,
and other health care providers that are trying to work together
by eliminating duplication of services. Since coordinated systems
require varying levels of referrals and financial arrangements,
this law should be reviewed and reformed.

<li><B> Reject "any willing provider" and mandatory "point
of service" requirements.</B> All health care providers qualified
to be in a network should receive fair and reasonable consideration,
according to the AHA. At the same time, networks must continue
to have high standards for the number, type, and location of providers
made available to enrollees. The AHA believes that forcing a plan
to include any health provider regardless of practice patterns
or history would not be in the patients' best interest. Instead,
the AHA holds firm in its belief that for networks to provide
efficient and effective coordinated care, they must be able to
retain their autonomy in choosing providers that will work best
within their particular goals and objectives.
</ol>
</ul>
<P>
<B> Independent Citizens' Commission on Medicare.</B> The AHA
believes that creation of an independent citizens' commission
on Medicare will serve in several important ways to retain the
integrity of the Medicare program. "While Congress ultimately
must be held accountable,"  the AHA believes that an independent
bipartisan commission should assess each year how much money is
needed to maintain the current program. Congress would review
the commission's recommendations and set its own target through
the regular budget process. The commission also would be charged
with holding public hearings, translating the congressional budget
targets into recommendations for a benefit package and provider
payment rates that would be presented to Congress for an up-or-down
vote (much like the base closing commission's report).
<P>
<B> Shared Responsibility.</B> The AHA believes that reducing
the budget deficit and ensuring the financial solvency of the
Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund requires shared responsibility.
To accomplish this, the AHA endorses a plan which will require
everyone with a stake in Medicare -- hospitals, health systems,
physicians and other providers, and beneficiaries -- to share
the financial task of restoring the solvency of the HI fund. This
means that changes in benefits, beneficiary cost sharing, eligibility,
program revenues, and provider payments all must be included.
Further reductions directed solely at providers are not viewed
by the AHA as reliable and effective solutions. To bolster this
point, the AHA notes that despite spending reductions of approximately
$48 billion in Medicare hospital payments since 1988, Medicare
continues to grow by approximately 11 percent each year. The AHA
adds that for Medicare inpatient and outpatient care combined,
1993 Prospective Payment Assessment Commission data show hospitals
losing 11 cents on each dollar it cost them to provide care. 
<P>
 If Congress adopted proposals which procured savings only by
cutting provider reimbursements, the AHA estimates that by the
year 2000, Medicare inpatient operating margins for hospitals
could fall to <I>negative</I> 20.6 percent. Every type of hospital
(rural, urban, large, small, teaching, and non-teaching) would
be hurt, according to the AHA. To balance the reductions in Medicare
payments, says the AHA, hospitals would have to continue to pass
this loss in revenue on to other payers (non-Medicare patients
and their employers).
<P>
<B> Ensuring Access for the Nation's Most Vulnerable.</B> In its
testimony before Congress, the AHA reiterated a strong commitment
to ensuring access for the elderly and disabled. The AHA believes
that health plans should not be able to exclude individuals based
on where they reside; nor should they be excluded systematically
based on their previous health status or potential need for services.

<h4>AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION </h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a draft proposal by the American Medical
Association entitled "Transforming Medicare and other Budget
Proposals," dated June 22, 1995.</I>
<P>
 The American Medical Association argues for a voucher type approach
in the Medicare program. As far back as 1986, the AMA endorsed
a voucher for all Medicare-eligible Americans to use in purchasing
health insurance. In its most recent proposal, the AMA proposes
to transform Medicare into a system which emphasizes personal
responsibility and choice. The AMA estimates that its proposal
will save $162.2 billion over a seven-year period, based on an
analysis conducted for the AMA by Price Waterhouse. The AMA believes
that if its plan was enacted and continued through Fiscal Year
2002, it would keep the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
(Part A) solvent for at least the next 15 years. 
<P>
 Under the AMA proposal, all Medicare-eligible individuals will
be allowed to choose to participate in the current Medicare program
or in the optional "Medichoice" program. For those remaining
in the "traditional Medicare" program, there will be
changes in how the program is financed. These changes would: 
<P>
<ol>
<li>Abolish current HI and SMI deductible and copayment requirements;
<li>Retain one-half of this new amount as a Part A insurance premium
for the reduced cost-sharing requirements;
<li>Establish a Beneficiary Escrow Account (BEA) for each enrollee
to accumulate the remainder of the supplemental amount as it is
received from the enrollee each month;
<li>Charge each BEA beneficiary with benefit payments made on his
or her behalf during the year;
<li>Refund to each enrollee any balance remaining in the BEA that
exceeds benefit payments made on his or her behalf during the
year;
<li>Exempt Medicare beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid and other
"qualified" beneficiaries from the requirement to contribute
the extra amount; and

<li>Reduce the contribution required of Medicare beneficiaries who
have incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. The amount
of the reduction will equal 100 percent minus the percent by which
the beneficiary's income exceeds the poverty level. For example,
a beneficiary with an income at 125 percent of the poverty level
would have his all-inclusive deductible reduced by 50 percent.
Physicians will be prohibited from charging beneficiaries with
incomes less than 200 percent of poverty more than the amount
reimbursed by the Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA).
(A mechanism should be established for beneficiaries to establish
their eligibility for this preferential treatment.)
</ol>
<P>
 Enrollees who choose to participate in the Medichoice program
will receive for the following calendar year the appropriate actuarial
value of their Medicare benefits, less the annual amount of any
HI (Hospital Insurance, or Part A) and/or SMI (Supplemental Medical
Insurance, or Part B) payments they otherwise would have to make.
This is the "defined government contribution."  A beneficiary
who chooses the Medichoice option will not be required to pay
the HI/SMI premiums which he/she otherwise would be obligated
to pay for traditional Medicare coverage during the period of
Medichoice enrollment. The enrollee opting for Medichoice picks
a private plan meeting certain conditions. 
<P>
 According to the AMA, the plans must include the following: 
<P>
<ul>
<li><B>Health Benefit Plan Requirements.</B> Any plan may participate
in the Medichoice program provided it meets certain minimum standards
adapted to apply to the Medichoice program from the provisions
governing chapter 89 of title 5, U.S.C., and 5 CFR 890.201 (FEHBP
minimum standard requirements). (7)

<li><B>Types of Benefits.</B> Plans participating in the Medichoice
system must comply with similar guidelines governing the FEHBP
(5 U.S.C. 8904). Benefits covered include payment for or direct
provision of hospital care, surgical care and treatment, medical
care and treatment, obstetrical benefits, health prevention services,
prescribed drugs, medicines, and prosthetic devices, and other
medical supplies and services.

<li><B>Health Benefit Plans.</B> Health benefit plans participating
in the Medichoice program may be of the following types:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Traditional Health Benefit Plans. Plans offering benefits under
which payments for services are calculated according to the usual,
customary, and reasonable fees or charges prevailing in the community
in which a beneficiary obtains services from physicians, hospitals,
or other providers of health services.

<li>Benefit Payment Schedule Plans. Plans offering benefits under
which certain sums of money, enumerated in a schedule of benefits
provided under the plan, are paid to beneficiaries for services
obtained from physicians, hospitals, or other providers of health
services. 

<li>Prepaid Comprehensive Medical Plans. Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), or other plans
which offer comprehensive health benefits on a prepaid basis.

<li>Medical Savings Account Plans. Plans which offer catastrophic
medical expense insurance in combination with establishing a Medical
Savings Account (MSA):

<ul>
<li>Allowed annual deposits to an MSA are limited to the value of
the annual government contribution amount. Part of the funds must
be applied toward purchase of a high-deductible catastrophic insurance
policy each year which must cover the types of services provided
by the FEHBP program.

<li>Contributions to an MSA equal to the value of the government
contribution amount should be exempt from federal and state income
taxation.

<li>Distributions from a beneficiary's MSA should be exempt from
federal and state income tax if used for medical expenses, health
insurance premiums, and long-term care.

<li>Interest and dividend earnings on MSA balances should be exempt
from federal and state income tax while they remain in the account.

<li>Other provisions relating to MSAs held by Medicare beneficiaries
will be governed by rules applicable to IRAs, except that mandatory
withdrawal at a certain age is not applicable to MSAs held by
Medicare beneficiaries.</ul>

<li>Enrollment in Medichoice. Patients choosing the "Medichoice"
option would have access to a wide range of plans similar to those
offered by the FEHBP. Each person would receive:
<ul>
<li>Advance notice of the government's contribution (to be determined
actuarially) toward the cost of Medichoice plans;

<li>Information and rates on plans in the individual's area to assist
"value comparison;" and

<li>A Medichoice election and enrollment form (available on attaining
Medicare eligibility and on an annualized basis).
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>
<P>
 
<P>
Patients would pay the difference when the plan costs exceed the
government contribution or keep the savings when the government
contribution exceeds the plan costs.

<h4>FEDERATION OF AMERICAN HEALTH SYSTEMS</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes proposals for Medicare reform presented
in testimony before the House Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee
on Health and Environment, on July 18, 1995, by Tom Scully, President
of the Federation of American Health Systems.</I>
<P>
 The Federation of American Health Systems is an association representing
1,700 for-profit hospitals. 
<P>
 The Federation argues that while Medicare is in dire need of
reform, it must come in the form of substantive restructuring
in addition to spending reductions. This restructuring means a
new and privatized payment system. While the Federation is opposed
to the level of Medicare budget targets proposed by Congress,
it believes the best way to achieve those goals is to transform
Medicare from a defined benefit program into one of a defined
contribution. 
<P>
 According to the Federation, the best model for a privatized
system is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP).
By offering beneficiaries the flexibility to purchase health plans
with the assistance of a voucher, and by providing financial incentives
to use their medical coverage wisely, says the Federation, Congress
can slow the rate at which the Medicare program is increasing.
Instead of traditional cuts in Medicare, which take the form of
price controls on providers of health care, competition in the
health care market would drive down costs in a restructured program,
just as it has in the private sector. 
<P>
 The benefits of moving Medicare toward a defined contribution
system, says the Federation, are the significant savings the federal
government can achieve and the higher quality of benefits that
the nation's seniors would obtain. Implementing a privatized system
would take several years. "The Federation has advocated a
smooth transition to this system. From 1996 to 2000, all seniors
could opt to stay in the traditional Medicare program or voluntarily
choose a private plan. After 2000, all seniors would choose plans
in a system like FEHBP, where all plans, including traditional
Medicare, received a defined contribution (from the government)." (8)

<P>
 The Federation firmly believes that the free-market forces of
consumer choice and competition, not price controls through federal
regulation, are needed to reduce spending in health care efficiently.
Competition would require health care providers to give value
and better quality for the health care dollars the elderly would
be spending. Furthermore, the Federation is adamant that "if
funding is to be removed from the system, we'd prefer to adjust
and streamline in response to a local market that creates rational
incentives, not cuts in the current Medicare price setting system
that already has created thousands of perverse incentives that
produce only inefficiency."

<h4>GROUP HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA</h4>
<P>
<I>Unless otherwise noted, the following summarizes testimony
before the House Committee on Commerce, Subcommittee on Health
and Environment, by Karen Ignani, President of the GHAA, on July
18, 1995.</I>
<P>
 The Group Health Association of America (GHAA) is the leading
national association representing health maintenance organizations
(HMOs). Their 385 member HMOs serve 80 percent of the 50 million
Americans receiving health care through HMOs.
<P>
 The GHAA supports a Medicare reform proposal that would allow
enrollees to choose from various health plans currently "available
to millions of working Americans both in the private sector and
federal government:  Medicare should be reoriented toward a model
in which Medicare beneficiaries have the opportunity to choose
from among a broad array of options that compete on the basics
of quality, service, and cost, and are held to comparable accountability
standards." (9)
<P>
 In coming up with a set of principles and design for such a reform,
the GHAA looked at the experiences of its member plans in both
the private and public (federal government) sectors, including
the approximately three million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled
in managed care plans.
<P>
 The crux of the GHAA's proposed reform is to facilitate the expansion
of existing Medicare markets, encourage the creation of new Medicare
markets, and ensure the viability and solvency of various health
plans so they may absorb the increased capacity of future enrollees.
In general, the GHAA recommends changes in the following five
areas that would:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Improve beneficiary information, awareness, and enrollment process.

<li>Expand the infrastructure of health plan choices available to
beneficiaries.

<li>Maintain strong standards for health plans participating in Medicare.

<li>Begin to transition HCFA from the current regulatory approach
to the beneficiary choice model.

<li>Transition to improved Medicare payment methodologies.
</ol>
<P>
<B>Improving beneficiary information, awareness, and enrollment
process:</B> It is imperative, says the GHAA, in order to allow
beneficiaries to make well-informed decisions about their health
plans, that the information be made readily available and easy
to understand. To do so, the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) should work with health plans participating in the Medicare
program to develop educational information for beneficiaries.
Basic characteristics of the various options, including services
and benefits covered, premiums, deductibles, copayments-payments,
should be made available. Such information should be sent to all
prospective beneficiaries six months before they become eligible
for Medicare. Another change endorsed by the GHAA is to allow
newly eligible Medicare enrollees to elect HMO enrollment that
is effective the first month they become eligible for Medicare,
rather than require them to wait until the second month. 
<P>
<B>Expanding the infrastructure of options available to beneficiaries:</B>
 The GHAA calls for a wider range of options to be made available
to Medicare beneficiaries. Options ranging from catastrophic coverage
plans, to fee-for-service, to the various types of managed care
(HMOs, PPOs, IPAs), point of service, and non-managed care systems
should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. 
<P>
 Maintaining strong standards for options participating in Medicare.
All health plans should meet comparable standards designed to
address access, quality of care, grievance procedures, and solvency.
This is to protect beneficiaries who have been wrongfully denied
access to coverage, or who are unsure about the quality of care
they are receiving in comparison to other providers, and to provide
the comfort and security that comes from knowing they are purchasing
solid health coverage. Anti-managed care laws in existence throughout
certain states should be pre-empted. The GHAA also calls on Congress
to reform certain antitrust laws.
<P>
 Transitioning HCFA to implement new model:  The regulatory and
bureaucratic infrastructure within HCFA needs to be changed to
implement a consumer choice model. In the interim, HCFA should
simplify administrative procedures for submission and processing
of applications and claims. On a regional level, the GHAA says
that HCFA should begin to narrow the variation in interpretation
of policy by regional offices and encourage uniformity in the
review and approval of contracts, products, and marketing materials.

<P>
 Transitioning to improved Medicare payment methodologies. According
to the GHAA, Medicare needs to conform to the changing environment
surrounding health care and future payment policies. In practice,
the GHAA proposes to turn the program from a defined benefits
program into one of a defined contribution with incentives for
beneficiaries to choose plans that deliver high-quality, cost-effective
health care. Specifically, the payment mechanism envisioned by
the GHAA "should permit these options to establish premiums
for the benefits they offer, and should establish a defined government
contribution based upon the per capita cost to the Medicare program
of providing Medicare covered benefits to all eligible beneficiaries." (10)

<h4>HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (HLC)</h4>
<P>
<I>The following summarizes a "Draft Proposal" developed
by the council's task force on Medicare. (11) As such, it does not
necessarily reflect an official or final position the HLC has
taken with respect to Medicare reform.</I>
<P>
The Healthcare Leadership Council is comprised of managed care
companies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals (for-profit and
not-for-profit), medical device manufacturers, and nurse practitioners.
<P>
 The Healthcare Leadership Council's draft legislative policy
initiative centers on five specific areas:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Expand Program Options and Establish Federal Standards for
Qualification.
<li>Modify Program Reimbursement.
<li>Restructure Management and Oversight of Program.
<li>Preempt State Anti-Competitive Health Plan Requirements.
<li>Ensure Appropriate Support for Medicare Education, Research.
</ol>
<P>
 The HLC believes that the free-market principles of competition
and consumer choice should enter the Medicare system. If Medicare
beneficiaries are allowed a wide spectrum of health plan options,
the efficiencies and success of the private marketplace will improve
the Medicare program.
<P>
 In the draft HLC approach, Medicare beneficiaries would be able
to choose from the following list of options:  traditional Medicare;
Medical Savings Accounts; employer-sponsored plans; and all qualified
managed care products (HMOs, PPOs, point of service, managed indemnity,
and integrated provider systems). In order to facilitate the expansion
of health plans in the marketplace, says the HLC, federal standards
regarding health plan qualification must rely on the market, not
a regulatory structure, to help shape effective plan designs that
foster competition. With the exception of plan capacity and ability
to serve new enrollees, all health plans, including Medicare supplemental
plans, must provide coverage to eligible beneficiaries. 
<P>
 While the current Medicare benefit structure would act as a minimum
benefits package in the HLC approach, the copayments-payment and
deductible amounts would be allowed to vary by plan design and
product. Health plans are allowed to offer additional benefits.
The HLC explicitly prohibits the mandating of additional benefits.
Much like the GHAA's proposal, the HLC supports a requirement
which would inform prospective Medicare beneficiaries, at least
6 months prior to eligibility, of their various options and the
nature of the Medicare program. Upon becoming Medicare-eligible,
beneficiaries would have the option of enrolling in the private
health plan of their choice or entering the traditional Medicare
program. New beneficiaries would be enrolled automatically in
the traditional Medicare program if they fail to elect a private
plan option. Beneficiaries currently insured in a private health
plan option who fail to choose another plan during the enrollment
period will remain in their present plan. Enrollees currently
enrolled in the traditional Medicare program could opt out at
any time during the year and enroll in a capitated plan option.
<P>
 To allow the elderly to make informed decisions when choosing
their type of health coverage, there would be an annual education
period sponsored by the federal government. Educational briefing
materials that are easily understood (much like the FEHBP pamphlets
available to federal employees each year) would be made available.
Health plans would be allowed to market their products provided
they meet uniform and consistent guidelines as established by
HCFA. To ensure that low-income beneficiaries did not face increased
costs, subsidies would be maintained under current law (Medicaid
continues to pay applicable Medicare premiums). Discretion would
be given to the states in determining whether subsidized individuals
stay in the current fee-for-service Medicare arrangement or are
enrolled in a managed care option.
<P>
 Federal payments for qualified health plan beneficiaries would
be capitated. To ensure a fair playing field, traditional Medicare
and qualified health plans would be required to accept the same
average rates of increase in their capitated federal payments.
All plans would receive the same federally defined contribution
per beneficiary. Adjustments will be made according to current
AAPCC methodologies (age, gender, and geography). (12) To help facilitate
timely payments to health plans, reimbursements would be made
directly from the government to the plan/provider. To meet annual
expenditures as determined by Congress, increases in the initial
capitated federal contribution would be limited to specified per
capita growth targets. 
<P>
 The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) would be restructured
and streamlined to reflect the changing environment in the health
care market. Inconsistent rulings and determinations by regional
offices would be reformed so that health plans have guidance and
predictability in designing products. 
<P>
 State laws that are deemed to be anti-competitive and that have
adversely affect Medicare choices and innovations in the marketplace
would be preempted. For example, state requirements regarding
"any willing provider, mandatory point of service, essential
community provider, etc."  would not be allowed.

</center><P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>

<P>Designed to operate as a federally run health insurance program for 
America's elderly, Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" 
and "fiscally responsible."1   Now, however, Medicare is essentially 
bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in 
doubt. According to the 1995 Trustees Report, if Medicare is not reformed 
the cash flow of the HI trust fund (Part A), which finances hospital 
benefits for the elderly, will go into the red in fiscal year 1997 and 
the fund will run out of money and become insolvent in the year 2002.2  
The report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which 
finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat 
without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for 
the first 25 years,"3  a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be 
added on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on 
the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this 
would raise payroll taxes -- and hence the cost of employing Americans -- 
by an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven 
years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll 
tax of $585 per year.

<P>To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without 
reforming the program -- that is, to put it on a permanently sound 
footing -- an immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would 
need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise t
axes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. 
The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per 
year.

<P>And this is only to bail out the hospital program and enable those 
benefits to be paid. Part B also will require a rapidly increasing 
subsidy from general revenues to continue paying for physician services. 
"Growth rates have been so rapid," explain the trustees, "that outlays of 
the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per 
enrollee in the last five years. For the same period, the program grew 
19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control 
the cost of the program."4   With the trustees' "intermediate" 
estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will 
grow from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated 
$89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.5 	

<P>Trying to hold down Medicare's costs through price controls on 
health providers and through stringent regulations is no answer. 
Not only has this strategy failed to control costs, it encourages 
physicians and hospitals to "game" the government rather than 
properly serve their patients. Moreover, price controls have shifted 
costs to the private sector, driving up premiums for working individuals 
and families. 

<P>Instead of trying to tighten current controls and regulations, the 
proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives 
to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, 
standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must 
be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different 
benefits. This is the same dynamic that has allowed health costs to be 
brought under control while improving quality in the private sector -- 
and in the government-sponsored health plan enjoyed by Members of Congress 
and other federal employees.

<P>The way to achieve the same results in Medicare is to pattern it 
broadly after the existing Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan 
(FEHBP), which covers almost nine million federal employees, families, 
and retirees, including present and former Members of Congress. This 
new program, perhaps renamed "Medi-Choice," would replace today's
 defined benefit program with a defined contribution program that 
 gives America's seniors an unprecedented opportunity to choose their 
 own health plan and range of benefits, just as retired Members of 
 Congress and other federal retirees do. Under such a system, unlike 
 today's Medicare program, the nation's elderly and disabled could 
 choose sound health insurance from a variety of managed care and 
 fee-for-service arrangements. And retirees could choose coverage 
 for services not covered by today's standardized Medicare program -- 
 such as a prescription drug benefit -- by accepting, say, higher 
 copayments for other covered services. One of the great ironies of 
 the Medicare debate is that those who oppose reform are denying the 
 elderly the chance to receive many basic medical services already 
 available to working Americans, and even to the indigent.

<P>The key financial difference is that the government would make a 
defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, 
rather than reimburse each Washington-approved service according to a 
fee schedule that defies comprehension and ignores market realities.6  
This incentive encourages beneficiaries to pick plans with the best 
value for money, pocketing part of the savings from choosing more 
efficient coverage. It already has enabled spending in the FEHBP to 
increase at half the rate of Medicare, in addition to which federal 
workers and retirees this year were treated to premium reductions 
averaging 3.3 percent. Introducing the same incentive system into a 
reformed Medicare program would save hundreds of billions of dollars 
over the next decade, putting the program on a sound financial footing 
so that it can serve both today's elderly and the next generation of 
Americans.

<P>Congress in reality has only two choices when considering the 
future of Medicare. One choice is to make no significant change in 
how Medicare is run and try to pay for future trust fund shortfalls 
either by raising payroll and other taxes or by diverting money from 
other programs. This means Medicare survives only by draining money 
from the rest of the budget or by raising taxes dramatically.

<P>The second choice is to change the way Medicare is run so that 
benefits are delivered more efficiently, avoiding future tax 
increases or a diversion of money from other programs. Making the 
program more efficient not only will reduce the financial burden 
Medicare places on the next generation, but also will improve the 
quality of benefits and choices available to America's senior citizens.


<P><B>HOW TODAY'S MEDICARE SYSTEM WORKS</B>

<P>Today's Medicare program pays doctors, hospitals, and other 
health care providers for inpatient hospital care, some inpatient 
care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, hospice care, 
physician and supplier services, and outpatient services. In providing 
these services to the elderly and disabled, the program is divided into 
two parts. Part A finances the hospital insurance (HI) portion. Part B 
finances the supplemental medical insurance (SMI) portion, which covers 
physicians' fees. 

<P><B>Part A</B> of Medicare provides premium-free coverage for part of 
the costs associated with certain hospital stays and limited follow-up 
services. Part A is financed currently through mandatory payroll taxes, which are paid into a trust fund by both employers and employees. When Medicare began in 1966, federal actuaries estimated future expenditures for Part A so that a payroll tax could be established based on potential costs. But the government's estimates fell far short of the actual costs of running this portion of the Medicare program. 

<P>The Medicare trustees recently issued a stunning report which reveals 
that the Part A trust fund will be insolvent by the year 2002. 
The reasons for this looming fiscal crisis include congressional 
mandates expanding covered benefits (such as adding coverage for the 
disabled population beginning in 1973) without providing offsetting 
changes in copayments or coinsurance, general medical inflation, and 
increased utilization by an aging population with longer life expectancies. 

<P><B>Part B</B> is voluntary. All persons age 65 or over may choose 
to enroll in the supplemental medical insurance program by paying a 
monthly premium. The current contribution level ($46.10 per month as 
of January 1, 1995) constitutes just 29 percent of the actual cost of 
the Part B program. The remaining 71 percent is provided by the taxpayers. 
Part B covers physician services, laboratory services, outpatient hospital 
services, and other medical services. The program pays 80 percent of the 
allowed charge (after the annual $100 deductible is met); beneficiaries 
are responsible for the remaining 20 percent coinsurance required by law. 
In sharp contrast with typical plans in the private sector, as well as the 
FEHBP which covers retired Members of Congress and federal workers, Medicare 
has all of the undesirable features of a bureaucratic system.


<P><B>1)  Medicare relies on ineffective price controls to try to curb 
costs.</B>

<P>Medicare is a classic example of the failures of price controls to 
slow the growth of prices and expenditures. Not surprisingly, the 
program exhibits all the chronic distortions and inefficiencies that 
typically accompany a price control system.7  It is ironic that as 
countries around the world are abandoning price controls and central 
planning, America tries to use them to deliver health care to the 
elderly. It is also rather astonishing to find some lawmakers surprised 
at the inability of these tools to keep Medicare's expenditures under 
control.	

<P>Price controls in Medicare take such forms as the diagnostic 
related group (DRG) system for hospital payments and the resource-based 
relative value scale (RBRVS) system for physician services -- the latter 
remarkably similar to the obsolete labor theory of value, which is the 
basis of socialist economics.8  Under the DRG system, hospitals are 
reimbursed according to a complex system of fees based on the illness 
being treated, while physicians are subject to a fee schedule according 
to the procedure being used. The "value" of a doctor's labor, along with 
the "value" of other statistically weighted "resource inputs" into the 
provision of a medical service, is calculated according to the statistical 
methods of social sciences. Fees are set on the basis of this statistical 
calculation, as applied to each of approximately 7,000 medical procedures, 
as measured and weighed by experts at HCFA.9  Needless to say, the 
consequences, such as cost shifting and similar distortions, have not 
proven any different from those resulting from the imposition of price 
controls in any other sector of the economy.10  Controls have not worked, 
and the SMI program is growing at an unsustainable rate under current 
legislation and rules.	

<P>This elaborate system of controls has failed to hold the rate of 
growth in Medicare expenditures to a degree comparable to the private 
sector. For example, Medicare has experienced 10 percent overall growth 
and is projected to grow at approximately the same rate over the next 
five years. Contrast this with the private sector, where employer 
health premiums in 1995 dropped by 1.1 percent while medical inflation 
increased by only 4.7 percent. Price controls also have led to distortions 
and inefficiencies familiar to any student of such controls. For example:


<UL>
<LI>Government action to squeeze payments to Medicare hospitals and 
physicians has led to significant cost shifting (or, more accurately, 
"price shifting") to non-Medicare services.

<LI>Price controls have encouraged providers to try to make up for low 
fees by increasing the volume of services (such as calling patients in 
for additional office visits or conducting tests of marginal value) or by 
such actions as reducing the average duration of office visits. The 
government's response -- typical of responses to this form of price control 
evasion -- has been to introduce elaborate "expenditure controls," 
with the result that honest physicians are penalized for hard work and 
attention to their patients.

<LI>Diagnosis codes are modified subtly by physicians and hospitals to 
qualify for better payments. Indeed, software packages are marketed 
routinely to hospitals and doctors to show them how to maximize 
reimbursements from Medicare by choosing one diagnosis code rather 
than another for the same medical problem.

</UL>
<P>The experience of price controls in Medicare is the experience of 
price controls throughout history. Providers, and sometimes patients, 
react to each control by seeking ways to evade it, with a general loss 
of efficiency; then government introduces a new, more elaborate control 
in an attempt to address the deficiencies of the first. The cycle continues 
as the providers find a way around that control. Meanwhile, efficiency 
suffers and expenditure targets are exceeded.


<P><B>2)  Government limits the benefits available to the elderly.</B>

<P>Unlike congressional and federal retirees, who are covered under a 
variety of plans in the FEHBP, most other senior citizens are locked 
into the "one-size-fits-all" Medicare program. There is no freedom to 
choose levels of benefits, or to choose alternative benefits, within 
today's Medicare. Beyond electing to participate in the voluntary 
supplemental insurance program (SMI, or Part B) with its standardized 
benefits, the only choice most elderly Americans make in health insurance 
is whether they will purchase a "Medi-gap" policy for services and benefits 
not covered in the Part B program. But retired Members of Congress and 
federal workers, just like active members of the federal workforce, can 
choose from health insurance plans ranging from fee-for-service coverage, 
to union-sponsored plans, to various forms of managed care. Moreover, they 
can choose plans with different covered services, such as dental benefits 
and drug coverage, that generally are not available under Medicare.

<P>Another important benefit found routinely in private plans but not in 
Medicare is catastrophic coverage. This crucial benefit protects individuals 
against high costs associated with catastrophic illness or accidents. Among 
the other benefits not covered by Medicare but covered by the FEHBP's 
popular Blue Cross Blue Shield Standard Plan are (to take one example):

<P><UL>
<LI>Preventive screening, stool tests for blood, prostate specific antigen 
tests, and related office visit charges.

<LI>Routine physical exam, including a history and risk assessment, and a 
serum cholesterol test, once every year.

<LI>Home nursing care.

<LI>Smoking cessation.

<LI>Home physician visits.
</UL>

<B>3)  Medicare resists innovation in the delivery of care.</B>

<P>In addition to its implicit distortions and evasions, a price control 
system fails to control costs because its bureaucratic nature reduces the 
pace at which efficiency-improving innovations are introduced. In a 
competitive market-based system, choice and competition lead to a 
decentralized, continuous, and rapid introduction of ideas to improve
 the ratio of quality to price. These are accepted or rejected to the 
 degree that buyers and sellers agree they are an improvement. 

<P>In a centrally planned system like Medicare, the process is entirely 
different. Proposed changes must "trickle up" to senior officials 
responsible for the program, after which they typically must be evaluated 
by bureaucrats and boards, proposed to politicians, and subjected to the 
pressures of competing interests before they take effect. The result is 
slow and encourages politically influenced decisions. Moreover, private 
sector managers are motivated by competition to find the best way to 
satisfy the patient at the lowest cost. Bureaucrats are motivated by 
the incentive to avoid risk and controversy, which results in the denial 
of many new services and procedures to Medicare patients. 

<P>Medicare is run by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), an 
agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HCFA's more 
than 4,000 employees issue and enforce hundreds of pages of regulations and 
thousands of pages of guidelines, managing virtually every aspect of the
 delivery and financing of the health care to the elderly.11  While Medicare 
 claims an overhead cost of just three percent, the rules and regulations 
 emanating from HCFA merely shift large administrative costs to hospitals 
 and physicians. Moreover, Medicare requires far more federal administrators 
 and rules for its operation than does the FEHBP, which also is run by the 
 government -- but on very different principles.

<P>In keeping with Medicare's central planning/price control design, 
Congress and HCFA systematically fail to introduce service delivery 
innovations while depriving seniors of state-of-the-art medical technology. 
For example:

<P><B>Medicare will refuse all reimbursements to hospitals conducting 
clinical studies on Medicare patients, so seniors are denied access to 
medical innovations developed in the United
States.</B> As highlighted in <I>USA Today</I>, "Faced with 
possible federal charges and potentially millions of dollars in fines, 
hospitals slammed on the brakes... shutting down all device studies or 
excluding Medicare patients from them. Doctors were no longer able to 
provide what they considered the latest treatments to many older 
patients."12  

<P>This happens not only because HCFA must formulate guidelines for 
every category of medical equipment, but also because it must decide 
whether each new medical device or treatment meets the criteria for 
coverage under Medicare Part B. This highly regulatory process has 
proven extremely expensive for taxpayers and dangerous for patients. 

<P>Dr. John Rowe, President of New York's Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 
recently gave the Senate Finance Committee a graphic example of what 
this means in practice. He asked the committee to consider a hospital 
performing major heart surgery under Medicare and a patient who needed 
a pacemaker inserted on his twentieth day in the hospital. If a clinical 
test happened to be underway on pacemakers to test the effectiveness of 
alternative electrical leads, HCFA might well rule this treatment 
experimental and deny reimbursement for the patient's stay in the 
hospital.13 

<P><B>Medicare is essentially a "fee-for-service" program.</B> It has 
made little progress in allowing, as an option to the elderly, managed 
care plans such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or competitive 
medical plans (CMSs). Moreover, with the rigid guidelines established 
by the HCFA, Medicare's payment scheme to HMOs is crude.14  As a result, 
former HCFA Administrator Gail Wilensky has testified before the House 
Ways and Means Committee that inadequate adjustments appear to have 
produced large overpayments to many HMOs and underpayments to others.15  

<P><B>Non-HMO managed care options are very limited.</B> For example, 
risk-based "carve-outs" like the package-priced heart bypass operation 
are not allowed except on a demonstration basis.

<P>Slow service design innovation is endemic to Medicare's price 
control/central planning system. While the process conceivably could 
be accelerated, it cannot even theoretically match the pace of 
innovation in a competitive marketplace.



<P><B>THE SCOPE OF MEDICARE'S FINANCIAL CRISIS</B>

<P>According to the Medicare Trustees, the financial soundness of the 
HI and SMI trust funds is of great concern due to their past and projected 
rapid rates of growth. This concern is heightened by the major demographic 
shifts in the workforce which supports the Medicare population. 
Currently, 4.7 workers support each beneficiary, but this ratio is 
expected to decrease significantly:  by the year 2030, only two workers 
will be supporting each beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate 
level of reserves and weak financing structure, however, the HI trust fund 
is projected to reach insolvency long before this demographic change takes 
place.

<P>Medicare has become the second largest entitlement program, after 
Social Security, in the federal budget. It is in long-term financial 
crisis because payroll taxes and other revenues do not cover costs, so 
net outlays must be covered by new taxes or by diverting money from other 
programs in the budget. Such net outlays totaled $144.7 billion in 1994. 
Government actuaries project that under current law Medicare will cost 
taxpayers $198.7 billion by 1997 and $263.6 billion by 2000. It is little 
wonder that the trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet 
secretaries and two other senior Administration officials, called on 
Congress to take "prompt, effective and decisive action" to curb the 
program's escalating costs.16  	

<P>These general problems appear in both parts of the Medicare program.

<P><B>The Mess in Medicare Part A (HI)</B>

<P>Medicare Part A (HI) is financed through payroll taxes on current employees, their employers, and the self-employed. Before January 1, 1994, HI tax rates of 1.45 percent on employees, 1.45 percent on employers, and 2.9 percent on the self-employed were applied on earnings up to $135,000.17  As part of his Administration's effort to reduce the deficit, President Clinton proposed that all earnings be subject to the HI tax, beginning in 1994. But despite lifting the limit on earnings subject to the HI tax to yield additional revenues, the Administration targeted the additional tax toward deficit reduction, not the HI trust fund. Since the HI tax took effect in 1966, the maximum taxable income level has been increased 23 separate times.18  	

<P>Contrary to widespread belief, HI revenues and expenditures do not go through a real trust fund. As a matter of fact, no trust fund with money in it actually exists.19  The "fund" is merely an obligation on the government to find the money, through taxes, to pay for future benefits. As the Annual Report by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Program explains, the government has never saved the necessary tax revenues to cover the future health care needs of private sector employees. The reason:  Medicare began paying out HI benefits at the same time it began collecting taxes.20  Younger workers on average contribute more to the Social Security and HI fund each year as their earnings increase. These contributions, however, are not saved. Instead, they are transferred and spent almost immediately on the current Medicare population.21  Moreover, the elderly typically receive far more in benefits than they have paid in payroll taxes.

<P>Long-range HI projections show that Medicare hospital costs will rise much more quickly than inflation. The most recent projections by the Board of Trustees of the HI trust fund use three alternative sets of assumptions:  low cost, intermediate, and high cost. The intermediate set of assumptions is said to represent the trustees' best estimate of the future economic and demographic trends that will affect the program's financial status. Under this option, the present financing structure is sufficient to ensure the payment of HI benefits only over the next seven years:  "As a result, the HI trust fund does not meet the trustees' short-range test of financial adequacy."22   Under the high cost (pessimistic) option, the fund will be exhausted in 2001. Under the low cost (optimistic) option, the fund will be exhausted in 2006. When the trust fund is fully depleted, Medicare is legally obliged to stop reimbursing providers.

<P><B>Medicare Part B's Exploding Costs</B>

<P>Congress established the Medicare Part B (or SMI) program in 1966 to create a taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by the nation's elderly, setting it at 50 percent of premium cost. Until 1973, SMI premiums continued to finance 50 percent of the benefit and administrative costs of the program, plus a small contingency amount in a separate trust fund. 

<P>When Part B costs began to increase faster than inflation, Congress decided to limit increases in the premium to the same percentage as Social Security cost of living adjustments. Under this new formula, revenues from Part B premiums for beneficiaries decreased from 50 percent to 25 percent of the expenditures because costs increased at a faster rate than inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), used to calculate Social Security adjustments. Beginning in the early 1980s, Congress has voted consistently to set Part B premiums at a level which would cover only 25 percent of costs. As a result, Medicare enrollees in 1995 pay only $46.10 per month for generous insurance that covers 80 percent of allowable charges with a deductible of only $100. The illusion that comprehensive health insurance is inexpensive means that Americans aged 65 or over have no incentive to control costs.

<P>In their report to Congress, the trustees "[n]ote with great concern the past and projected rapid growth in the cost of the program. Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays of the program have increased 53 percent in aggregate and 40 percent per enrollee in the last five years. For the same time period, the program grew 19 percent faster than the economy despite recent efforts to control the cost of the program."23   As a result of the escalating cost of this portion of Medicare, expenditures are projected to increase from 0.93 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1994 to 4.29 percent of GDP in 2069. With the trustees' "intermediate" estimates of future program growth, the annual taxpayer subsidy will rise from an estimated $38 billion in this fiscal year to an estimated $89 billion in five years and $147 billion in FY 2004.24 

<P><B>HOW TO REFORM MEDICARE</B>

<P>In grappling with Medicare's emerging fiscal crisis, Congress needs to pursue both short-term budgetary measures and a long-term strategy of structural change. Short-term measures are needed to deal with the program's injustices and glaring shortcomings. Long-term reform is needed to deal with structural financial problems and to improve the quality of care for America's seniors. Moreover, to deal with public confusion about the status of the Medicare system and the purpose of reform, Congress must educate the American people about the true dimensions of the problem, including the potential tax burden facing working Americans if action is not taken. This can be accomplished in two ways: 

<P>First, Congress should order the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to notify America's senior and disabled citizens that their Medicare hospitalization program faces bankruptcy as early as 2002, according to the Medicare Trustees Report. HCFA should explain that to keep the program going without reforms will mean billions of additional tax dollars taken from the paychecks of working Americans or diverted from other programs. 

<P>Second, Congress should order HCFA to inform the elderly that the premiums they pay for their Medicare supplementary insurance Part B represents only 25 percent of the premium income for those services and that their children and grandchildren, young working families, are paying for the bulk of these Medicare benefits out of general tax revenues. Most elderly believe that they are paying the full cost of their Medicare benefits; the truth about Medicare's financial condition and circumstances can only improve the quality of the necessary public debate. 


<P><B>Short-Term Reform of Part </B>

<P>Congress should act immediately to reduce the heavy taxpayer subsidy of Medicare's Part B premiums.

<P><B>OPTION #1:</B>  The simplest, though not necessarily the best, option would be to restore the premium to the original 50 percent level. This could be done by gradually phasing down the current level of taxpayer subsidies by five percent per year over a five-year period, which would save taxpayers approximately $37.27 billion over the next five years.25  By financing one-half of Part B program costs, Congress would return to the spirit of the original 1965 "contract" with America's taxpayers.

<P>Reducing the taxpayer subsidy would encourage many enrollees to compare the costs and benefits of more efficient private alternatives with the costs and benefits of the Part B program. The more the subsidy is reduced, the more level the playing field between the private sector and government. The elderly would have incentives to choose more efficient plans in the private sector. The likely result:  not just a reduction in the subsidy, but also a significant reduction in gross budget outlays for Medicare Part B.

<P>One problem with simply reducing the subsidy across the board is that it would impose some hardship on many lower-income Americans while continuing taxpayer support (albeit reduced) for the more affluent. It also would raise the cost to states of enrolling in Medicare some individuals already on Medicaid.

<P><B>OPTION #2:</B>  An alternative would be to reduce the current subsidy as income rises and perhaps raise the level of subsidy for the elderly with very low incomes. The savings from such a change would vary widely, depending on what method of means-testing was introduced. At, say, $65,000 adjusted gross income for individuals and $85,000 for couples, the subsidy might be phased out in increments of three percentage points per $1,000 of income above the threshold. The full premium would be paid by individuals above $98,000 in AGI and couples above $118,000 in AGI.

<P><I>Not a Tax.</I> Contrary to what liberals in Congress may say, a higher Part B premium represents not an increase in taxes, but a reduction in a large direct subsidy. It is not a tax increase because Medicare Part B is a voluntarily chosen service that can be provided just as easily by the private sector. Part B is a subsidized commercial service provided by the federal government in competition with the private sector. If Members of Congress believe it necessary to give high levels of subsidies to enrollees, those subsidies should be targeted not to everyone over 65, but to elderly citizens who cannot afford an acceptable level of physician services and other services now available under Part B.


<B>A POSSIBLE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM REFORM -- THE FEHBP</B>

<P>Members of Congress searching for an alternative model for Medicare reform do not have to look far. For well over three decades, Members of Congress and federal employees -- and federal retirees -- have been enrolled in a unique consumer-driven health care system called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Unlike Medicare, it is not run on the principles of central planning and price controls. Instead, it is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition.26  Beginning in 1960 with 51 plans for the federal workforce, the FEHBP now encompasses over 400 private health insurance plans nationwide, ranging from traditional indemnity insurance and fee-for-service to plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations to different forms of managed care, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, half of all persons with health insurance are covered by one of the 35 plans competing in the FEHBP.

<P>The FEHBP is entirely different from Medicare. For one thing, Medicare is a <B>defined benefit</B> program, meaning each enrollee has access to a specific set of health services which are paid for, in total or in part, by the federal government. The FEHBP, on the other hand, is a
<B>defined contribution</B> program in which the government agrees to provide federal workers or retirees with a financial contribution they can use to purchase the health coverage of their choice. 

<P>Even more important, and unlike Medicare, the FEHBP does not attempt to constrain costs by controlling prices and specifying a comprehensive set of services. It sets only minimal guidelines over how plans must be structured and marketed. The law specifies only a brief category of core benefits, permitting federal workers and retirees to choose the plans and benefits that are right for them. Cost restraint is achieved not with an army of Medicare-style price controllers, but through the operation of consumer choice in a market of competing plans. That is why FEHBP spending is projected to increase at about 6 percent per year while spending for Medicare is expected to grow at 10 percent per year.

<P><B>Choices for Federal Retirees.</B> The FEHBP is open to all congressional and federal retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. Under current rules, congressional or federal retirees are eligible to enroll in an FEHBP plan if they retired on an annuity with at least five years of continuous service at the time of retirement, or if they retired on a Civil Service disability. They also can assure coverage for spouses by electing survivor benefits, and any survivor annuitant can request coverage for grandchildren, under certain conditions, on or after August 11, 1994.27  	

<P>Significantly, while private sector firms have been cutting back, or even eliminating private health insurance for retirees altogether, the FEHBP has improved its coverage. Moreover, while the number of active employees has remained fairly constant over the past ten years, the number of retirees has grown from 1.3 million to 1.6 million.28  Congressional and federal retirees and their dependents now make up 40 percent of total enrollment,29  enjoying access to choices and services denied to Americans enrolled in Medicare. Among the features of the FEHBP:	

<P><B>Wide Choice of Health Plans.</B> No other group of Americans enjoys the range of personal choice over health plans available to active and retired congressional and federal employees. Their private plans range from fee-for-service to managed care. They can obtain plans through organizations they trust. Plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations are particularly popular among federal workers and retirees -- almost one-third are enrolled in such plans. Among the managed care plans, which have become quite popular in recent years, there are many different options, including "point of service" plans in which retired federal and congressional workers can choose to use a personal physician outside the HMO network for a higher copayment. 

<P>The FEHBP is very popular among federal retirees -- so popular that a significant number of federal retirees who enroll in Medicare keep their existing federal coverage as a "wraparound" plan. While Medicare is their primary source of insurance, the additional benefits included in the FEHBP (such as prescription drugs, catastrophic coverage, and preventive care) serve as more than adequate protection. As the National Association of Retired Federal Employees states in its 1995 guide to federal health plans for retirees, "All FEHB plans are good.... You can't make a serious mistake in choosing a FEHB plan unless you choose a high cost plan or option when you don't need one."30 	

<P><B>Choice of Health Benefits.</B> Federal retirees do not have merely a choice of plan. Unlike virtually all other Americans, active or retired, congressional and federal retirees also have the freedom to choose the services they want. Unlike Americans enrolled in Medicare, they are not locked into a single, government-standardized benefits package. Beyond the normal range of typical hospitalization and physician services, they can pick from a variety of plans that cover such items as skilled nursing care and home health care by a nurse, dental care, outpatient mental benefits, routine physical examinations, durable medical equipment and prostheses, hospice care, chemotherapy, radiation, physical and rehabilitative therapy, prescription drugs, mail order drugs, diabetic supplies, treatments for alcoholism or drug abuse, acupuncture, and chiropractic services. And FEHBP plans include catastrophic coverage -- in sharp contrast to Medicare.

<P><B>Advice and Consumer Information.</B> Congressional and federal retirees are not on their own in making a choosing a plan. They receive advice from private federal employee and retiree organizations on the best plans and best benefit options. 

<P>In particular, retirees and workers are advised by consumer organizations such as the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE). Washington's Consumer Checkbook, a consumer organization, advises retirees on the best options, such as enrolling in plans that coordinate with Medicare. Various other groups rate plans and provide information on services, quality, and levels of benefits. 

<P>For example, NARFE advises federal retirees on the range of catastrophic coverage options available to them. Among other tips, it points out to retirees that the High Option Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, while expensive, has "home health care benefits that the Standard Blues plan doesn't have"; that the Alliance Plan covers up to 90 Cardiac Rehabilitation visits for angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and coronary surgery; that the most comprehensive dental coverage is available from the Mail Handlers high option plan, as well as the Postmasters and National Association of Letter Carriers high option plans; that the Government Employees Health Association offers the best value in home health care services; that the Blues offer the best hospice care; and that the best skilled nursing benefits are offered by the Postmasters.31 	

<P><B>Choice of Price.</B> Unlike the limited or non-existent choices available to private sector workers and retirees, and unlike the rigidly controlled pricing under Medicare, FEHBP premiums, coinsurance, or copayments represent a wide range of options. Under the FEHBP's financing formula, the federal government will contribute up to 75 percent of the cost of a plan, up to a maximum of $1,600 for individuals and $3,490 for families.

<P>If congressional and federal retirees wish to choose a very expensive "Cadillac" plan with a rich set of benefits, they may do so, but they make the decision to pay extra. If, on the other hand, they pick a less expensive plan, they save money on their portion of the premium. Private health plans compete directly for these consumers' dollars. 

<P>Needless to say, the dynamics of a competitive market in the FEHBP have had a positive impact on premium prices for federal employees and retirees. According to the Congressional Budget Office:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past five years, FEHB plan premiums have increased an average of 6.8 percent a year, whereas the premiums paid by medium and large firms surveyed by Hay/Huggins Company, a benefits consulting firm, increased by 10.8 percent a year. Furthermore, FEHB premiums are expected to decline by 3.3 percent in 1995; the Congressional Budget Office projects, however, that aggregate private health premiums are likely to rise by about 5
percent.32</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>According to the CBO, Medicare hospitalization (HI) costs will rise 8.4 percent per annum between 1995 and 2000, and Medicare supplemental medical insurance (SMI) costs will rise at 12.9 percent per year.33 

<P><B>Deficiencies of the FEHBP.</B> The FEHBP is not without deficiencies.34  The most significant is that plans must offer a form of community-rated premiums, meaning they must offer a plan to a healthy 19-year-old at exactly the same premium as a very sick 89-year-old. This inevitably leads to adverse selection. Still, the FEHBP functions so well that even this problem does not undermine the program, although it does introduce distortions and perverse incentives that prevent it from functioning as effectively as it should. A wise reform would be to vary the degree of assistance to FEHBP enrollees at least according to their age and to permit plans to vary premiums, also by age. That would allow plans to compete more effectively and to offer services with less vulnerability to adverse selection.


<B>A REFORM AGENDA FOR MEDICARE</B>

<P>Congress has committed itself to curbing the growth of Medicare spending in order to restore financial stability and prevent out-of-control spending from draining money from other programs or forcing huge increases in taxes. To carry out this wise commitment, Congress can proceed in two ways. It can impose tighter regulation and stricter price controls while cutting medical services for the elderly, as it has in the past. But experience shows that this strategy yields only short-term spending reductions at best. In the long run, it does nothing to curb runaway spending and undermines the quality of care for the elderly. 

<P>The other option for Congress is to achieve spending restraint by giving the elderly greater control over their Medicare dollars and greater opportunity to use their dollars to select the health care plans and services that are right for them. Such a reform, modeled after the system serving federal retirees, would use consumer choice and competition to curb waste and improve care. 

<P>Such a reform would include three principles:

<UL>
<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #1:</B> Medicare should be changed from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution program.

<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #2:</B> The elderly should be allowed to use their Medicare dollars to enroll in a plan with health services that they choose, not services that bureaucrats or politicians have chosen for them.

<B><LI>PRINCIPLE #3:</B> Cost control should be achieved through consumer choice and competition, not central planning and price controls. HCFA's complex system of price controls and other restrictions should be phased out.

<P>One reform incorporating these principles would be to provide Americans eligible for Medicare with a voucher to purchase the Medicare plan of their choice. The sum provided would be the combination of two amounts, reflecting the financing of today's Part A and a reformed Part B. The two elements of the voucher would be:

</UL>

<P><B>Portion (A)</B> Part of the voucher would be an amount -- adjusted by age, sex, reason for entitlement (age or disability), institutional status, ESRD (end-stage renal dialysis) status, and geography -- intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the hospital and other services in today's Part A of Medicare. This portion would not be means-tested.

<P><B>Portion (B)</B> The other part of the voucher would be based on an amount -- adjusted by age, sex, and geography -- intended to cover the actuarial equivalent of the services currently in Part B. This base would be means-tested to determine the dollar amount of this element. Since today's Part B is voluntary, the elderly should be allowed to decline this portion of the voucher if they so choose.

<P>An alternative form of defined contribution would be for Medicare to cover a certain percentage of the premium for the plan of the elderly's choice, up to a maximum dollar amount. This would be more like the FEHBP but would mean somewhat less financial assistance for the lower-income elderly.

<P>The elderly could use the voucher (or percentage contribution) to purchase a Medicare-approved health plan of their choice. Medicare would distribute information on the plans to the elderly, as well as a checklist from which they could pick the desired plan. Medicare would then inform the appropriate plan of the retiree's choice.

<P>These plans, somewhat like those offered through the FEHBP to retired federal workers, would have to meet certain requirements to be marketed as Medicare-approved:

<P><B>Plan Requirement #1.</B> A plan would have to meet certain financial requirements to assure solvency. It would also have to be licensed in the state in which it provided coverage to Medicare enrollees.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #2.</B> The plan would have to specify its services and costs in a standardized manner to enable the elderly to choose without confusion. It would also have to make this information available to the government for distribution to Medicare beneficiaries.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #3.</B> Each plan would have to contain a core set of benefits, including basic hospital and physician services with catastrophic coverage. This core would be leaner than today's Medicare, thereby permitting the elderly to purchase a less expensive basic plan and supplement it with optional services or -- with the help of the voucher -- to buy those services directly from providers. As an option, plans could include a Medical Savings Account from which the enrollee could pay directly for services with insurance only for catastrophic expenditures. Funds in a Medical Savings Account could be used only for health care services.

<P>The core benefits for those declining the Part B portion of the voucher would be less extensive and focused on hospital services. Seniors who declined the Part B portion could buy additional insurance or pay for benefits without any requirement that these additional services comply with federal guidelines. Thus, the equivalent of Part B coverage would continue to be non-compulsory.

<P>An alternative would be for Congress to require that, at a minimum, each plan contain the specific services available today under Medicare, yet allow plans to offer additional services -- with perhaps higher copayments for services currently in the Medicare package.

<P>States would be precluded from mandating any benefits or premium structures for plans serving the Medicare population.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #4.</B> Each plan would have to set premiums according to limited underwriting principles:  age, sex, reason for entitlement (age or disability), institutional status, ESRD status, and geography, but not health status.35  One possible exception might be to permit "lifestyle" premium discounts for seniors willing to enroll in sickness prevention and health promotion programs.

<P><B>Plan Requirement #5.</B> Each plan would have to accept any Medicare-eligible applicant for coverage at its published terms during an annual "open season" enrollment period.


<P><B>Government's Role</B>

<P>The government's role -- particularly HCFA's -- would be limited but important. HCFA would be precluded by law from regulating either the prices of medical services to the elderly or the premiums for plans. It would have three very important functions:

<P>a) The government would create a federally sponsored corporation to offer a "Medicare Standard Plan" which would offer the standard Part A and Part B benefits available today. The Medicare Standard Plan would be assigned a premium, and any Medicare enrollee would be able to choose it in preference to any of the private plans. Enrollees would have to apply their vouchers toward the plan premium. The standard plan would have to comply with exactly the same disclosure and other requirements as any private plan.

<P>b) Each year HCFA would be responsible for running the "open season," the period in which the elderly and disabled in Medicare chose the health plan they wanted for the following year. Just before the open period, HCFA would send all enrollees information on which to base their choice:  the value of their voucher, a list of Medicare-approved plans in their area with a standardized listing of benefits and premiums, and a form for indicating their choice. This is virtually identical to the role played by the Office of Personnel Management in the FEHBP.

<P>c) Once a Medicare retiree had made a choice and returned the form, HCFA would send the voucher to the chosen plan if the premium exceeded the value of the voucher. The enrollee would be responsible for the difference but could choose to have HCFA send the entire premium, paying for the difference by reducing the amount of his Social Security check (this is how most of the elderly now pay their Part B premium). If an individual chose a low-cost plan which cost less than the voucher, HCFA would deposit the difference in a Medical Savings Account of the enrollee's choice. This money could be used only for health care payments.


<B>ADVANTAGES OF THE REFORM</B>

<P>A reform based on this consumer-choice approach would have numerous advantages for the elderly and the taxpayer.

<P><B>Freedom to Choose Plans and Benefits.</B> Under a consumer choice Medicare system, elderly Americans could choose the private health insurance that best meets their individual needs. With the advice and counsel of their doctors, they could pick not only the level of benefits above a basic set of hospital and physicians services, but also a broad range of medical services and treatments available on the free market -- for instance, a plan with drug coverage or dental care -- which they do not get under Medicare. Consulting with their doctors, rather than waiting for approval from HCFA bureaucrats, also means the elderly could take advantage of changes in treatments, medical procedures, and service delivery innovations -- something lacking in today's Medicare. The only large elderly group with access to similar breakthroughs today are retired Members of Congress and federal employees.

<P><B>Value for Money.</B> Like federal and congressional retirees, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to pocket any savings from their personal decisions. While the cost of health care is considerably higher for the elderly than for active workers and their families, the government contribution to their health plans also would be higher, depending on differences in age, sex, and geography.36  

<P><B>Controlling Costs.</B> While by no means a perfect market, the FEHBP has been able to control costs better than either private, employer-based insurance or the current Medicare program, according to the Congressional Budget Office and such private econometric firms as Lewin-ICF.37  This success is due in large part to the ability of Members of Congress and other federal workers, families, and retirees to shop among the various health plans in their geographic regions to get the best value for their money. In recent years, even though the FEHBP enrolls approximately 1.6 million higher-cost retirees and dependents and includes progressively higher benefits, outlays have increased at a much slower rate than the Medicare program's.38  With the establishment of a Medi-Choice system similar in structure to the current FEHBP, the powerful market forces of consumer choice and competition should produce similar dynamics and results in the Medicare program. 

<P><B>Reduced Red Tape and Bureaucracy.</B> To improve administration, Congress could relieve the Health Care Financing Administration of trying to dictate the minutiae of virtually every facet of health care financing and delivery for the nation's elderly. Instead of administering complex, cumbersome, and economically inefficient price controls or promulgating a seemingly endless stream of rules, regulations, and guidelines, HCFA could simply transmit defined contributions, either as vouchers or through electronic transmissions, to the plans chosen by enrollees, certify private plans as meeting basic hospital and physicians benefits, meet fiscal solvency requirements, and guarantee catastrophic coverage (a benefit Medicare does not provide). Moreover, HCFA could promulgate and enforce rules protecting elderly citizens from fraud by insurance companies. 


<P>An AARP Health Plan?

<P>Much like the National Association of Retired Federal Employees (NARFE), which rates and grades the quality and benefits of plans offered to congressional and federal retirees, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and other senior citizens' organizations could play an important role in a revamped Medicare system by rating and approving competing plans on the basis of price, service, quality, and benefits. In fact, there is every opportunity for organizations like the AARP to sponsor and market their own health care plans in competition with established insurance carriers, as do certain federal unions and employee organizations within the FEHBP.


<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>Unless Congress acts soon, Medicare costs will continue to rise at unsustainable rates and the program will become insolvent. The Medicare program is structurally unsound. It provides a false sense of security for the nation's elderly. Attempts to hold down annual cost increases of more than 10 percent per year through arbitrary price controls have failed. The Health Care Financing Administration has become entrenched, intrusive, and overly bureaucratic, issuing volumes of rules, regulations, and guidelines that are confusing not only to the public and lawmakers, but also to doctors, hospital administrators, and patients. 

<P>The new debate over Medicare reform is one of the most important since Congress debated comprehensive health care reform last year. Congress must make decisions that affect the lives of every American, working or retired, rich or poor, healthy or ill. It is imperative that participants in this debate, particularly Members of Congress, focus their attention not only on the financial health, but also on the administrative structure, including the regulatory details, of the Medicare system. While pursuing necessary spending restraints in Medicare and other government programs in order to secure an end to ruinous deficits, lawmakers also must begin a fundamental restructuring of the program with a view toward improving the quality, availability, and security of health services for the elderly well into the next century. 

<P>If Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in the quantity and the quality of their health care coverage, or already overburdened working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes just to maintain the current level of benefits. Either consequence is tantamount to fiscal and political disaster. But if Congress uses this historic opportunity to create a new Medicare system based on consumer choice and competition, it will mean health care choice and security for today's elderly and a strong and solvent retirement health care system for future generations of Americans as well.

<BR>(35) For example, rather than simply approving insurance carriers, OPM still tries to negotiate rates and benefits for hundreds of plans -- although premium prices in reality must meet the test of market demand.  Moreover, reversing a historical pattern of "passive management," the Clinton Administration has in some instances required the inclusion in plans of certain controversial services.  And Congress recently imposed the Medicare fee schedule, although it restricted it to services for federal retirees.
<BR>(36) The authors believe that the demographic risk factors are sufficient to protect health plans from undue "adverse selection."  However, if Congress determined that additional risk adjusters were needed, they could be added.
<BR>(37) As noted earlier, one central weakness of the FEHBP is its outdated insurance underwriting practices.  It currently uses a crude form of community rating, with no distinction in premium payments for active and retired federal workers and their families.  This arrangement also contributes directly to the persistent problem of "adverse selection" in the FEHBP.  The problems could be largely eliminated by an adjustment in the FEHBP premium structure that instituted higher premiums for retirees than for active workers, along with an increase in the government contribution to retirees' chosen plans or a tax credit for federal retirees to offset the increased cost.

<p>
<a name="mediscare">TAXPAYER-SUBSIDIZED MEDISCARE CAMPAIGN</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the summer of 1995, a myriad of taxpayer-subsidized special-interest groups joined together to frighten senior citizens into believing that attempts to reform the Medicare system are really attempts to "steal" their health care. In effect, elderly Americans were being forced to subsidize their own trip through the Haunted Medicare House.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A June 27, 1995, "Medicare Message" distributed by the House Democratic Leadership refers to six taxpayer-subsidized organizations involved in the effort to "talk about the devastating effects of the Republican Medicare cuts."  These organizations received nearly $80 million in federal funding between July 1993 and June 1994:<ul>
<p><li>AFL-CIO ($2,038,000)
<p><li>Families USA ($250,000)
<p><li>Service Employees International Union ($137,000)
<p><li>Save Our Security ($100,000)
<p><li>AARP ($76,000,000)
<p><li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ($148,000)
</ul><p>


<a name="congress">CONGRESS NOW LIVES UNDER THE SAME LAWS AS OTHER EMPLOYERS</a>
<p>The Congressional Accountability Act applied the following laws to Congress:<ul>
<li>Age Discrimination in Employment Act
<li>Americans With Disabilities Act
<li>Civil Rights Act
<li>Employee Polygraph Protection Act
<li>Fair Labor Standards Act
<li>Family and Medical Leave Act
<li>National Labor Relations Act
<li>Occupational Safety and Health Act
<li>Rehabilitation Act
<li>Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sponsors' hopes that Congress would be more attentive to burdens these laws place on Americans once the laws applied to Congress have been confirmed. Shortly after these laws took effect on Capitol Hill, the House and Senate began considering legislation to allow employers to offer compensatory time off rather than overtime pay for employees working extra hours.

turned to Justice  Powell's plurality opinion in <U>Bakke</U> for support:  &quot;Political
judgments regarding the necessity  for the particular [racial] classification...
are the product of rough compromise struck by  contending groups within the
democratic process. When they touch upon an individual's race  or ethnic
background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is 
asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored  to serve a compelling
governmental interest. The Constitution guarantees that right to  every person
regardless of his background.&quot;

observed: &quot;I believe there is a moral and  constitutional equivalence

</P>
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<A NAME="119"><B>119</B></A>					One such
questionable program is the  Bureau of Indian Affairs' Higher Education Grant
Program, which received an appropriation  of $29.8 million in FY 1995. This
program provides up to $7,450 per year to college  students who belong to Indian
tribes &quot;to supplement  the total financial aid package prepared [for the
student] by the college financial aid officer.&quot;   Thus, two students from
identical socioeconomic backgrounds would receive  dramatically different levels
of federal assistance to  attend college, with the only difference between the
two being that one is &quot;at least  onefourth degree Indian blood descendent&quot;
and owns  a &quot;certificate of Indian blood.&quot;  See 
<U>1994 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</U>,  Program ID15.114. There is
some evidence to  suggest that many Americans with trace levels of  Indian
ancestry have taken advantage of these preferences. Demographic trends, for 
example, cannot explain the threefold increase in  the number of Americans
identifying themselves as American Indians since the 1960 census.  Ac
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  cording to <U>The New York Times</U>
for March 5, 1991, &quot;the growing realization that an  Indian heritage can
mean special benefits has motivated many Indians, and presumably some 
impostors, to openly assert an Indian background.&quot;   One California
contractor won a $19 million contract on the Los Angeles rapid transit  system
because he was onesixtyfourth American Indian. See Roberts and Stratton, 
<U>The New Color Line</U>, p. 158.

<p>
<a name="scrutiny">WHAT IS STRICT SCRUTINY?</a><p>
		There are two parts to the strict scrutiny standard:<ol>
<p><li>There must be a "compelling governmental interest" underlying an affirmative action measure; and 
<p><li>The measure must be "narrowly tailored" to serve that interest. </ol>
<p>	Courts typically look at six factors in deciding whether a race-conscious measure is narrowly tailored:<ol>
<p><li>Whether the government first considered race-neutral alternatives;
<p><li>Whether there is a waiver mechanism that limits the scope of the program to those who actually have been harmed by discrimination in the geographic region at issue;
<p><li>Whether race is the factor in determining eligibility for a program, or is just one of several factors in the decision-making process;
<p><li>The comparison of numerical targets with the number of qualified minorities in the relevant sector or industry; 
<p><li>Whether the program is subject to periodic review; and 
<p><li>Whether, and to what extent, the program imposes a burden on persons who do not belong to the favored groups and who are not personally responsible for the discrimination in question.
</ol>
<p>

<a name="section">THE SECTION 8(a) PROGRAM</a><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the most controversial of the federal efforts to bestow an explicit advantage on favored racial and ethnic groups is the Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program. The 8(a) program allows the SBA to channel federal procurement contracts to individuals and firms defined as socially and economically disadvantaged.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Under the law, members of minority groups wishing to participate in this program are presumed to suffer from social and economic disadvantage. In contrast, non-minorities hoping to be classified as disadvantaged must prove social disadvantage "on the basis of clear and convincing evidence."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Small Business Act defines socially disadvantaged individuals as "those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities." Economically disadvantaged individuals are "those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The Act establishes a government-wide goal for participation by these concerns at "not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year" and requires the head of each federal agency to establish agency-specific goals for participation by these firms. In FY 1993, 5,414 companies participated in this program and received contracts valued at $4.5 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For a business owner to qualify for the Small Business Administration's disadvantaged business program, his net worth may not exceed $250,000. But in arriving at this calculation, the SBA does not include either the owner's equity in his companies and homes or the wealth of his spouse. In 1994, federal auditors selected five SBA district offices and examined 50 supposedly disadvantaged companies that had received at least $10 million each in federal contracts. Among their findings:<ul>
<p><li>35 of the 50 owners were worth more than $1 million each; 
<p><li>Five owners received salaries and bonuses totaling between $1 million and $2.5 million over a two-year period. Seven others earned more than $750,000; 
<p><li>Over a dozen reported equity stakes in their firms of between $1 million and $9 million; 
<p><li>Five had homes worth $800,000 to $1.4 million.</ul><p>

<a name="how">HOW RACE-NORMING WORKS AT HARVARD'S DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Applications from "underrepresented minorities" receive a bright green sticker and a pink status sheet, which are removed so the application can be read blind. A panel of professors narrows the 600-700 applications down to about 45. Then the stickers are reattached, and department officials review the applications to ascertain how many minorities were accepted. At this point, Harvard accepts any minority applicant who "would complete the program if admitted."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If this standard were applied to all applicants, the department would admit 200 to 300 students a year. Instead, it admits from 35 to 45. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The numbers: 570 students applied to the government department in the fall of 1995. Of the 35 minority applicants, six (17 percent) were accepted. In contrast, only 27 of the 535 non-minority applicants (about 5 percent) were accepted.

<p>

<a name="economic">THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</a><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Some economists have estimated the costs that affirmative action policies impose on the economy and on individual businesses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	<b>A 6.5 Percent Mandate.</b>  Economist Peter Griffin estimates that the cost of complying with affirmative action rules and regulations for firms that do business with the federal government amounted to 6.5 percent of all costs in 1980.*
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>A 4 Percent Burden on Gross Domestic Product.</b>  John Hunter, Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University, estimates that total U.S. output would be about 2.5 percent, or $150 billion, higher if every employer in the country subject to federal law were free to use employment tests and select on merit.** In addition, Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer estimate that the administrative costs associated with affirmative action since 1980 amount to approximately $113 billion per year, or another 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the total negative impact on GDP is estimated to be about 4 percent per year.***
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	<b>The Cost to California Taxpayers.</b> In a November 24, 1993, letter to State Attorney General Dan Lungren, the California Joint Legislative Budget Committee noted that the state government spends roughly $200 million per year on affirmative action and other race-based programs.

<a name = "frustrating">FRUSTRATING THE ELECTORATE: THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The experience of the campaign for a balanced budget amendment is a clear demonstration of Washington's resistance to reform and its ability to outmaneuver the public. Despite overwhelming public support for an amendment to the Constitution to require Congress to balance the budget, Congress repeatedly has refused to send one to the states for ratification.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In 1983, when a national movement to call a constitutional convention for the specific purpose of proposing such an amendment appeared within striking distance of the 34 states required, the congressional leadership finally moderated its long opposition and allowed a proposal for a balanced budget amendment to move through the legislative bureaucracy. This move succeeded in its primary purpose of killing the possibility of a convention, but the leadership still faced the problem of allowing a vote on a popular issue that it did not want enacted. Adroit behind-the-scenes maneuvering was necessary to allow Members who did not want to see an amendment pass, but for political reasons did not want to be seen as voting against such an amendment, to have it both ways.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	This effort to prevent a successful vote continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s as the debt mounted and the voters increasingly demanded a balanced budget. The most egregious example was the 1994 vote on an amendment proposed by Senator Paul Simon (D-IL), which appeared to have the 67 Senate votes needed for passage. To stop this measure, the Senate leadership introduced a competing proposal of their own design. They knew this version had no chance of passage, and that was its main attraction: Its real purpose was to split the vote and thereby deny either version a sufficient majority. In this way, Senators who really opposed a balanced budget amendment could portray themselves as favoring an amendment, and even go on record as voting for one, because they were assured that none would pass. Such maneuvers are common, and the people, repeatedly frustrated in their demands but with little evidence as to who exactly is responsible, are left to wonder what really happened.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a name = "crime">In Philadelphia</a>, federal judge Norma Shapiro prevents local judges from detaining many violent defendants before trial by prohibiting them from considering the defendant's prior criminal record, mental health history, or drug dependency. The federal court also prevents any pre-trial detention for such "non-violent" crimes as stalking, carjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terrorist threats, or weapons violations. Judges in Philadelphia are prohibited from forcing defendants to appear at trial, and the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice. Instead of being in jail, these individuals have gone on to commit numerous other crimes. Between 1994 and June 1995, Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 of these criminals (previously released under federal court orders) for 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug deals, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.

<p><b>1913</b> The 16th Amendment to the Constitution removes restrictions on Congress's ability to levy income taxes directly on the population. In 1914, federal income taxes accounted for less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the average American family's income. In 1994, over 24 percent of family income went to pay federal taxes.
<p><b>1913</b> The 17th Amendment to the Constitution mandates the direct election of Senators by the people, instead of by state legislatures. As a result, the states lose their role in national policymaking and their ability to carry out their constitutional role of checking and balancing the national government.
<p><b>1933-1945</b> New Deal legislation greatly increases the power and reach of the national government, but states and local governments retain many of their traditional functions. Waging World War II expands central government and solidifies Washington's ability to control the economy.
<p><b>1937</b> President Franklin Roosevelt threatens to overcome the Supreme Court's resistance to the expansion of federal power by packing the Court with additional members who support his agenda. In response to this threat, the Court acquiesces to most New Deal legislation by declaring many constitutional restraints null and void and dramatically expanding the powers granted to Washington by the Constitution. 
<p><b>1938</b> The Fair Labor Standards Act federalizes most worker-management relations in the U.S.
<p><b>1941</b> In United States v. Darby, the Supreme Court says the 10th Amendment is only a "truism" and "nothing more than declaratory," and denotes no constraints that the federal government need heed.
<p><b>1942</b> In Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court removes virtually all limits on the federal government's power to regulate the economy by upholding the fines levied against an Ohio farmer for growing non-commercial wheat for his own use. The Court rules that Washington has the right to regulate any activity that may affect interstate commerce, including activity wholly confined to a private farm.
<p><b>1960s</b> The War on Poverty and other welfare projects vastly expand federal programs and funding throughout the economy and society.
<p><b>1985</b> In Garcia v. SAMTA, the Supreme Court rules that state and local agencies must follow national labor standards. The Court disposes of the remnants of federalism by saying that the states' interests are fully represented by the Senate, and thus that any law duly enacted by Congress automatically has the states' consent.
<p><b>1960s</b> In a series of controversial decisions, the Supreme Court overturns and rewrites whole sections of long-established law in the name of expanded individual rights, dramatically expanding the power of the federal courts to reshape society by undermining law enforcement and public order, removing religion from public life, erasing all restrictions on the power of Congress vis--vis the states and society, rewriting state constitutions, taking over state and local administrations, imposing racial quotas, and so forth.
<p><b>1994</b> The Supreme Court decides in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton that the people have no right to set term limits on elected federal officials.
<p><b>1995</b> In U.S. v. Lopez, in a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court uses the 10th Amendment to restrict federal power for the first time in six decades, although it is still uncertain to what extent this decision will limit Congress's power under the Commerce Clause.

<title>Time To Say Goodbye To Dollar Bill -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i> Time To Say Goodbye To Dollar Bill</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

	Let's talk money. No, this is not a solicitation. Nor is it another one of those stories about how Washington wastes your tax dollars. Rather it's about all those $1 bills in your wallet, and why we should replace them with a new dollar coin.  
<p>
	You're probably wondering what a conservative is doing resurrecting one of the many failures of the malaise-laden presidency of Jimmy Carter. "Didn't we try this dollar coin experiment in the late 1970s?" Well, yes. But like much of what the government did in the 1970s, it didn't do it right. So maybe it's time to try again.  
<p>
	Some 273 million Susan B. Anthony dollar coins (affectionately called "Carter's quarters") are still in circulation, according to the U.S. Mint and Federal Reserve. Mostly the coins are used by mass-transit systems in major U.S. cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Baltimore, and St. Louis. It is also popular with vending machine companies. 
<p>
	It wasn't the concept of a dollar coin that caused the public to reject the Anthony dollar. What ruined it for Susan was her flawed design, her rather quick introduction into the public's psyche, and the politicians' unwillingness to stand by her. The design had a number of flaws.
<p>
	Because of its similar silver color, size and ridged edge, the Anthony dollar was too easily confused with the quarter. Another drawback: The Susan B. Anthony coin coexisted with the paper dollar, causing problems for many retailers who didn't want to deal with both dollar bills and dollar coins. 
<p>
	If we were to do it all over again, the politicians would need to support that decision as fully as the Canadian government did in 1987 when it switched from a paper dollar to a dollar coin.  
<p>
Th are are good reasons for making the switch. For one, it would save taxpayers like you and me a ton of money. 
<p>	For example, mass-transit systems across the country would save an estimated $124 million annually by processing dollar coins instead of dollar bills.  According to a young colleague of mine who lives in Baltimore, every time he rides a city bus or the Baltimore "metro" system, he puts a dollar bill into a vending machine, which then gives him a Susan B. Anthony dollar to use as a token. My friend points out, correctly, that having a dollar coin in the first place would save time and money. 
<p>	Studies show that the cost to Baltimore's taxpayers of going to the bank, stocking the Anthony dollars and processing the dollar bills exceeds $300,000 a year. This money could be saved if the public had dollar coins in the first place.
<p>	In Chicago, the money saved would be even greater. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) handles about 410,000 dollar bills a day. The cost of sorting these bills is about $22 per thousand. But coins can be counted for just $2. Switching to a dollar coin could save the CTA $2.4 million per year in bill-processing costs.
<p>	 New York City has solved the problem of high paper-dollar processing costs: The bus system simply does not accept dollar bills. That's right. The greenback is no good on a bus in the Big Apple.   
<p>	The bottom line is this: Coins are more convenient, and because they last much longer than dollar bills, they are less costly to produce over the long run.
<p>	The time has come for Washington to lay the paper dollar to rest in favor of a dollar coin.

<title>Welfare's "Dirty Little Secret" -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>Welfare's "Dirty Little Secret"</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 26, 1995<br><hr width=50%></center><P>

	What is the "dirty little secret" of the welfare state?
<p>
	Just this: Across the country there are more than 40,000 hurting, adoptable children languishing in foster care, waiting for moms and dads -- and plenty of would-be moms and dads are waiting to adopt them.
<p>
	Yet, standing between the two -- seemingly hell-bent on keeping them apart -- is an army of highly paid welfare bureaucrats who don't like adoption and have erected a practically insurmountable array of barriers against those who wish to adopt.
<p>
	Why? According to <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/mom2.html">Conna Craig</a>, president of the Institute for Children and a former adopted child herself, there are <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">three reasons</a>.
<p>
	First, the public adoption system rewards and encourages foster care over adoption. When foster parents are paid between $200 and $530 per month, based on the number of children they care for, it creates a financial incentive to keep children in temporary homes. Private adoption agencies, by contrast, are paid by the number of successful adoptions they arrange. In other words, the cash flows in the direction of adoption, not foster care.
<p>
	Second, since adoption often is put forward as an alternative to abortion, feminist groups and their allies have succeeded in inculcating an anti-adoption bias in the social service community and mainstream media. Magazines, ranging from Good Housekeeping to Playboy, have painted adoption as a traumatic event that can cause psychological damage to both mother and child. In fact, the benefits of adoption far outweigh long-term foster care. A study by the Search Institute of Minneapolis has shown that adopted children rate their relationship with their parents even more positively than a national sample of non-adopted adolescents.
<p>
	Third, the social service community has placed the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being and happiness of children. Too many kids are repeatedly returned to abusive or unfit parents, as if "family reunification" is more important than the physical safety of children. Craig says one-third of all children returned to their "birth families" eventually must be returned to state care.
<p>
	Reforming this system won't be easy. Eliminating barriers against transracial adoptions -- as if white parents would be worse for a black child than no parents at all -- would be a step in the right direction. Because of these barriers, black children make up 40 percent of the foster-care population, even though they are only 15 percent of all children.
<p>
	The government shouldn't be funding permanent foster-care situations, but rather encouraging families to adopt and making it easier for them to do so. One way would be to enact a means-tested, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay the expensive one-time cost of adopting a child. By contrast, the government spends, on average, $13,000 per year to care for a foster child.
<p>
	Why not spend less than half than that on the better alternative -- adoption?

<title>Federal Health System is Medicare Refoerm Model -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>Federal Health System
Is Medicare Reform Model</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	As Congress debates competing proposals for saving the Medicare system, reformers on Capitol Hill need look no further than their own Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to find a model for getting the job done.
<P>	There are some extremely valuable lessons to be learned from FEHBP, which covers more than 9 million federal workers and retirees, including senators, representatives and congressional staff.
<p>	First, unlike Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, FEHBP gives enrollees the freedom to choose from among nearly 400 private health insurance plans during an annual "open season." The ensuing competition between insurance companies provides an incentive nowhere to be found in the current Medicare setup: An incentive to provide the most and best health care for the lowest cost.
<p>	The numbers tell the story: The average FEHBP premium actually went down 3.4 percent in 1995, and will go up by a mere four-tenths of one percent in 1996. A quarter of the plans in FEHBP will actually cut premiums next year. By contrast, Medicare costs have gone up more than 10 percent annually in recent years.
<p>	Also helping FEHBP keep costs under control is the fact that the program is based on a "defined contribution" by the government, unlike the "defined benefit" nature of Medicare. There's a big difference. In FEHBP, the government pays about 72 percent of the average premium. Everything above that is paid by the enrollee. That provides a real incentive to choose your coverage wisely.
<p>	By contrast, under Medicare -- a "defined benefit" program -- the government pays for a set of benefits and medical procedures selected by Washington bureaucrats -- nothing more, nothing less. The payments are made according to a fee schedule  -- also set by bureaucrats -- that defies comprehension and ignores the ups and downs of the health care market. You are out of luck if you need a benefit Medicare doesn't cover -- like prescription drug coverage -- that is widely available under FEHBP.
<p>	Under the federal employee program, fierce competition for new enrollees forces traditional firms like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, as well as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), professional groups and labor unions, to tailor their coverage to fit the particular financial and medical needs of their customers.
<p>	An important example here is catastrophic coverage, which is not available under Medicare, but could be under an FEHBP-style Medicare system. This crucial benefit would protect senior citizens against the type of costs associated with unexpected catastrophic accidents or illnesses that can easily wipe out a lifetime of savings. Other services not covered by Medicare but widely available to federal retirees under FEHBP include preventive screenings, routine physical exams, annual serum cholesterol tests, home nursing care, smoking cessation programs and home physician visits, to name just a few.
<p>	And here is something else to think about: FEHBP requires only 164 federal employees to administer, and there are less than 100 pages of federal regulations associated with the program. Compare that to the more than 4,000 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) employees creating miles and miles of frustrating red tape and bureaucracy for the Medicare system.
<p>	In other words, FEHBP provides far more choices at lower costs and involves far fewer bureaucrats and regulations. With such a model to guide them, there is no reason Congress can't fix Medicare for generations to come.<P>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>





<h3><i>GIMME A (WELFARE) BREAK</i></h3>
By Mildred (Annie) Hambleton<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/26/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>	
	It's almost a year since the 104th Congress was voted into office to shake things up. And, if you judge such things by the volume of complaints, they seem to be doing just that.
<P>	In the process, they also have done a number of things President Clinton had promised to do when he was campaigning for the White House -- promises he soon forgot. For example: "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>	I'm a middle-aged receptionist. To the tens of millions of us around the country who get up early in the morning every day and punch a time clock (figuratively, if not literally), welfare has become a costly joke. But the joke's on us: We pay our hard-earned wages so millions of others don't have to get up each morning and punch a time clock.
<p>	According to studies, the welfare system has cost us taxpayers more than $5 trillion since the War on Poverty was begun by President Johnson 30 years ago. How much is $5 trillion? I looked it up in the 1995 "Information Please Almanac." It is an amount equal to the combined economies of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Great Britain, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and Sweden.   
<p>	That's an awful lot of money, especially when it is obvious to almost everybody that we have lost the War on Poverty. All over the country -- from the "hollers" in my late husband's home state of West Virginia, to inner-city Chicago, where I grew up, and right down the street from The Heritage Foundation building where I work -- two and three generations of the same family have been raised on welfare: the mother, her mother, and the kids.
<p>	The new Congress seems serious about ending this. The liberals already are screaming about the fraying of the "safety net." I say: Fray away. Welfare was intended to provide temporary help to people down on their luck; it was not supposed to become a way of life. 
<p>	Not everybody on "welfare" is down-and-out and poor. For example, lots of film-makers -- graduates of UCLA and NYU and other expensive schools -- would have to go out and get real jobs if the National Endowment for the Arts and Corporation for Public Broadcasting stopped giving them our money. There are also hundreds (probably thousands) of artists, composers, musicians and writers of one sort or another who are  dependent on government grants. 
<p>	This is welfare for the well-to-do. And it also needs to end. There's no reason on earth that when the creators of Miss Piggy bring home the bacon, it has to be mine. I don't get a free ride -- why do they?
<p>	After more than 40 years of working, I know what they mean by the term "wage slave": I earn the money and Washington decides how much I get to keep.  Whenever tax cuts are mentioned, you hear something like this: "If we cut taxes, the Treasury will receive $160 billion less." 
<p>	So? What's wrong with that? It means you and I will get to keep -- and spend on ourselves and our families -- $160 billion more. The new Congress has put the focus back where it belongs. This is not and never was "the Treasury's" money. It's my money and your money.
<p>	If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole's 104th Congress successfully slows down government spending, it will be a banner year for the working people of America. As many of my fellow wage earners know, it is real hard to get excited about working hard when 40 cents out of every dollar is going to the tax man.
<p>	The young families in the apartment complex where I live want the opportunity to save for a home of their own and their kids' education. They don't have their hands out, saying "gimme, gimme"; they don't feel anybody owes them a living.
<p>	All we really want Congress to give us is a break. So to Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole I say, "Carry on. You're doing the right thing. Keep up the good work."
<p>	Let's end welfare as we know it, for people who won't work, artists who can't support themselves, and big business alike. The "gimme" times are over. And none too soon.
<p>

<html><title>Browbeating AARP -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>




<h3><i>BROWBEATING AARP</i></h3> 
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 25, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	A few weeks ago, just prior to a House vote on the issue, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) suddenly announced it was launching a massive grassroots campaign to oppose Medicare reform proposals in Congress. Media reports indicated that AARP, after months of soft-pedaling on the issue, would be establishing "campaign-style" field offices in "key presidential states," including New Hampshire and Iowa. 
<p>	The House approved its Medicare reform package, and now the Senate must come up with its own reform plan. But every American taxpayer should note the significance of AARP's late entry into the fray. This last minute activist turn by the nation's largest senior citizens' lobby was motivated by fear: Only six days before AARP's announcement, liberals in Congress had publicly browbeat the group into mounting a more offensive strategy opposing Medicare reform. 
<p>	The message was clear: We liberals have siphoned off huge portions of the taxpayers' money to help subsidize your lobbying activity for years -- now it's payback time. 
<p>	Groups like AARP that receive taxpayer funding even though they conduct lobbying activities (that means they use your money whether you agree with their cause or not) are now finding themselves captive to the politicians who give them your money. They're responding to veiled threats that their funding could be withdrawn if they don't dance to a particular political tune. 	Taxpayer funding of lobbying groups would be sharply curtailed under an amendment sponsored by Rep. Earnest Istook, R-Okla., and Congress is expected to take final action in the next few weeks. If it fails passage, political arm-twisting over issues like Medicare will continue. <p> 	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Sept. 28, that House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., "suggested this week that the AARP was making a mistake in not already mobilizing its 33 million members against Republican plans to slow Medicare spending." Gephardt's Senate counterpart, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., bemoaned that "it has been somewhat surprising that they've waited this long" to voice opposition.
<p>	Now, to you and me, those don't sound like doomsday proclamations. But in the nomenclature of official Washington they went off like cannon shots. In just six days, AARP announced the opening of anti-reform campaign offices nationwide, to disseminate the message that proposed changes in Medicare were "draconian." The group's Iowa spokesman -- apparently unconcerned that the group's grassroots organizing is supposed to be non-partisan -- reminded reformers in Congress that AARP members compose 10 percent of that state's population and thus represent a major voting bloc.
<p>	Of course the reason congressional liberals can browbeat this powerful special interest into action is because AARP is a major beneficiary of taxpayer financing. In fact, the $86 million AARP acknowledged receiving in federal funding in 1993 through various grant programs represented approximately one-quarter of its annual expenditures. AARP's sources of federal funding range from programs for the elderly to millions of dollars annually to provide clerical support for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
<p>	From July 1993 to June 1994, AARP's largest single source of taxpayer funding was the Department of Labor/Employment Training Administration's "Senior Community Service Employment Program." This one program provides about $49 million per year to AARP's bank account. More than $300 million of the $400 million appropriated for Program Year 1994 went to 9 seniors' organizations and the Forest Service, with the remainder going to the states.
<p>	AARP was also a major beneficiary of the EPA's "Senior Environmental Employment Program." The annual appropriation is $45 million. With that money, approximately 265 grants are made. The AARP receives approximately $20 million from this program. It provides support to almost every regional office of the EPA, as well as most divisions within the Washington headquarters. This particular program permits AARP to benefit from the inflow of funds and the EPA to benefit from low-cost labor to promote its agenda.
<p>	The group also received approximately $4.6 million per year under the Treasury Department/Internal Revenue Service's "Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program." This represents the lion's share of the grant's annual appropriation. Ironically, AARP could have used some of its own tax counseling, since they were recently forced to settle with the IRS for tens of millions of dollars in back taxes.
<p>	The browbeating of AARP into active opposition to Medicare reform symbolizes the arrogance and corruption created by 40 years of taxpayer-funded political patronage. Nobody asked the taxpayers whether they favored the causes AARP or literally hundreds of other groups espouse in their lobbying efforts. Yet, over the decades, Congress has handed them billions in taxpayer funding in ever-increasing increments. 
<p>	It's time for this "welfare for lobbyists" -- and the arm twisting it encourages -- to end.

<title>The Clinton Administration: Sound Bites Vs. Reality -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION: <br>
SOUND BITES VS. REALITY</h2>
By John S. Barry<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/19/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	"We have to cut yesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problems."
<p><blockquote>-- President Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 24, 1995.</blockquote>
<p>	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore continue to speak out, as they have for several years, about the need to "reinvent" the federal government and rein in the budget deficit. The vice president, to his credit, has issued more than two dozen reports through the National Performance Review, outlining many inefficiencies and excesses of big government.
<p>	Yet, now that Congress is trying to deliver the very "change" Clinton and Gore promised as candidates in 1992, the administration is balking. The president has threatened to veto 11 of the 13 appropriations bills now making their way through Congress, calling them too extreme.  
<p>	In fact, these appropriations bills are very modest: reducing the size of wasteful federal programs on average by just 10 percent. The appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, for example, would cut spending by a mere 4.5 percent on these programs from their 1995 levels. The $1.1 billion saved amounts to less than .08 percent of the entire federal budget. But even this is apparently too radical.
<p>	Despite his veto threats, the president insists he favors a balanced budget. He says he thinks the Republicans are going too far, too fast, and have their priorities mixed up.
<p>	Unfortunately, it is hard to take the president seriously. His own budget, released in February, showed the deficit increasing to $250 billion per year by the year 2000, and even more after that, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations.
<p>	Then, struck by the political mood of the country, the administration had second thoughts and issued a new budget in June. The president's new proposal was supposed to balance the budget by the year 2005. But CBO read the numbers differently. It estimates the new White House budget would result in a deficit of more than $200 billion in the year 2005, actually an increase of some $13 billion over the current year's deficit.
<p>	If the president is serious about reinventing government and balancing the budget, he can show it by supporting several proposals as put forth in the various appropriations bills.
<p>	For example, President Clinton has threatened to veto the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill, largely because it would eliminate the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). In his own budget, the president proposed increasing funding for this program by 622 percent! Yet, judging by downsizing and streamlining standards spelled out by administration officials, ATP is exactly the type of program the president should be against. 
<p>	Administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce, ATP is the most egregious example of what Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has termed "corporate welfare." The program directly subsidizes businesses involved in high technology research and development; thus placing the burden of these risky ventures on the shoulders of taxpayers, rather than on the private companies that stand to benefit from successful efforts. The program should be killed, not expanded.
<p>	President Clinton has threatened to veto the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education because it would eliminate the AmeriCorps program. This program is one of the president's favorites -- created in 1993 as a model program that would help "volunteer" students serve local U.S. communities. Unfortunately, these volunteers are anything but free help. A recent General Accounting Office study found the program costs more than $26,700 per "volunteer" per year, $7,900 more than the administration originally estimated. Ironically, while the president speaks publicly of making government work better at lower cost, he is adamant about protecting AmeriCorps -- even though 18 students could be supported through the Pell Grant program for the same cost as one AmeriCorps "volunteer."
<p>	President Clinton has threatened to veto the Transportation appropriation bill because it would limit urban mass transit grants. Yet, the mass transit program is one of the most ineffective in all of government; it is a boondoggle, pure and simple.
<p>	Over the past 25 years, more than $90 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, has been spent subsidizing local mass transit projects in an effort to promote public transportation. At the same time, mass transit's share of commuter travel has declined in nearly every city since the federal subsidies were initiated, down from 9 percent nationwide in 1970 to 5 percent in 1990. 
<p>	Do the math, Mr. President: Why are we building these systems if Americans don't use them? Federal subsidies, moreover, have encouraged many cities to build systems they cannot afford, leaving them heavily in debt. Yet, instead of supporting Congress's efforts to return money and authority to localities, the president would increase funding for mass transit grants. 
	<P>President Clinton was right about "cutting yesterday's government." That's exactly what Congress is trying to do. So, why is President Clinton standing in the way of reform?

<h2>ADMINISTRATION FAILS TO MAKE CASE

	On Oct. 17, hearings on Capitol Hill exposed the Clinton administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord as a haphazard and risky enterprise with no coherent political or military rationale. 
<p>	Lawmakers repeatedly challenged members of the Clinton foreign policy team to present clearly defined, attainable political goals and military objectives, estimates of the probability of success, the risks entailed, and readings of the level of support from the American people. Former U.S. Secretary of State Robert McNamara recently noted in his Vietnam memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam. It was evident from the responses of President Clinton's team that his administration is making the same deadly mistake.
<p>	The Clinton peace plan for Bosnia is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse. Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a known, specific, workable mission, President Clinton made the commitment of 25,000 U.S. ground troops first, more than two years ago, without any peace plan in hand. Now, his team is busy figuring out how to shoehorn a plan to fit an arbitrary U.S. military commitment only incidentally related to military conditions that may exist on the ground. This is strategy backwards -- a formula for confusion and disarray -- and members of Congress are correct to question it.
<p>	The hearings on Capitol Hill raised other basic yet prescient questions. For example, what are the objectives of this mission, and how will America know when they have been achieved? The 25,000-troop U.S. "Implementation Force" has been given no clearly defined and attainable military goals, nor specific criteria by which U.S. commanders can measure their success. The Clinton peace plan doesn't even address military objectives, and commits American forces to static "picket duty" in buffer zone. U.S. forces are intended to sit there (as in "sitting duck") and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  
<p>	In testimony on Capitol Hill, Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first U.N. troops in Sarajevo, made no bones about the fact that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents. He also let the House National Security Committee know that while the administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States is clearly the enemy of one side in this conflict. After all, the Serbs aren't likely to regard U.S. air strikes against them as acts of neutrality. Under such conditions, Gen. MacKenzie said if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	Another problem is that we have no exit strategy. Since U.S. forces have no well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" -- in which adverse circumstances force greater military commitment to avert disaster -- is built into the Clinton peace plan. The administration will be under tremendous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops to Bosnia. President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate U.S. military efforts when faced with inevitable resistance from the warring factions and the threat of widespread American casualties. 
<p>	Aware of these concerns, the White House's answer is to pledge that U.S. forces will be pulled out in 12 months. This is a purely political decision unrelated to actual conditions that could arise on the ground. Almost all lawmakers recognized the electoral motivations behind this pledge and were extremely skeptical when Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shaliskavili defended the 12-month timetable as being based on unexplained "operational reasons." As former Under Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<p>	The entire Clinton plan is based on a best-case scenario. Yet, astute military planning, down to the lowest levels, must always take into account what to do when anything (or everything) goes wrong. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates this administration.
<p> 	Needless to say, there are no contingency plans to address a worst-case scenario. Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced to cut and run, or reinforce troops and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed. 
<p>	The Clinton foreign policy team has failed to provide satisfactory answers to Congress on the fundamental issues involved in any military action, to say nothing of the host of other questions that arise about this particular mission. In the absence of such a rationale or credible plan for U.S. involvement, Congress should withhold its approval of President Clinton's Bosnia peace plan.

<html><title>Medicare Miracles -- Heritage</title>

<h2>MEDICARE MIRACLES</h2>
By Rep. Dan Miller<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/12/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>	Those who say the Age of Miracles ended centuries ago must have missed the opening stages of the Medicare reform debate. In recent weeks, some miraculous events have been witnessed by millions of Americans.
	<p>First,  there has been a big change in public opinion on the issue. Until fairly recently, nobody would believe there is a problem with Medicare. Now, when you ask, 63 percent of the public say there is a problem.
<p>	Second, those of us in Congress seeking to reform Medicare are making miraculous progress in explaining what we are trying to do and why. Until recently, it was difficult for people to understand that we are not cutting Medicare spending. We're reducing the growth of Medicare spending. There is a big difference. Whenever you hear House Speaker Newt Gingrich saying Medicare is going bankrupt, he always notes that we are going to spend more money on Medicare, not less. Remarkably, this message is now even getting through to the national media.
<p>	I was struck several weeks ago when Tom Brokaw and NBC News came to my district -- which has more senior citizens in it than any other in the country -- to attend a town hall meeting with my constituents. A few days later, when Brokaw introduced the town hall segment on the national news, he said "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending." Did you get that? Not "cut spending."
<p>	The following week, ABC News did something on the same topic, and Peter Jennings introduced a segment about how different lawmakers are handling the Medicare issue by saying "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending on Medicare." Bingo.
<p>	Then, as if to top it all off, I was watching the news and saw a segment with President Clinton, who said during a talk with Speaker Gingrich that Republicans want to reduce the growth of spending on Medicare. Surely, when Brokaw, Jennings and Clinton all get it right, we have truly witnessed a miracle!
<p>	Of course, it shouldn't take a miracle. The numbers speak for themselves: Under the "heartless" Medicare reform plan we have proposed, yearly spending on the average Medicare recipient will increase from the current level of $4,800 to $6,400 in seven years. It really drove us crazy when our opponents called that a "cut." The reason they did was because the $6,400  is less than they wanted to spend.
<p>	If we do nothing to slow the growth of  Medicare spending, we will have to impose a huge tax hike on working families or increase premiums dramatically for seniors. There is no escape. To stick with the program as currently structured,  you would have to raise the Medicare payroll tax more than $1,700 over seven years for somebody making $40,000 a year . That is a 100 percent increase. Or you have to raise the Medicare premiums paid by seniors by an astounding 300 percent.
<p>	Instead, we should restructure the program by allowing elderly citizens greater choices in medical coverage, which will force health-care providers to compete for their services. Such a system would be similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) which covers 9 million federal workers, retirees and their families.
<p>	Under FEHBP, competition between insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), retirement groups, professional organizations, and labor unions has consistently held premium costs below levels in the health-care market at large. Plus, unlike Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach,  FEHBP enrollees can choose from a wide variety of health-care plans, including many that Medicare doesn't offer. That way, enrollees are able to tailor their coverage to their own medical and financial situations.
<p>	Of course, pushing our plan through won't be easy. Medicare is a paperwork monster backed by fierce special interests. But I believe we can ready Medicare for the 21st Century. 	<p>Maybe we'll need another miracle to get there. But who would have predicted six months ago that we would see the amazing things that already have happened in our effort to fix Medicare?<p>

<title>What's Really At Stake In the Medicare Debate -- Heritage</title>

<h2>WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE IN THE MEDICARE DEBATE</h2>
By Grace Marie Arnett<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

10/12/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	Strip away the rhetoric and accusations about Medicare reform and the historic importance of the issue becomes clear: The debate over $270 billion in spending represents a pivotal decision over the role of government in the lives of free citizens.
<p>	The coming showdown presents both Congress and the American public with a clear choice: Either continue with a program based on government central planning and control, or give smart consumers operating in a competitive marketplace the chance to reform the system from the bottom up.
<p>	The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have made their decisions about which way to go; now it's time for the United States to follow suit.
<p>	Liberals already are waging their battles to protect this dinosaur of a program that even the Clinton administration admits is unsustainable as currently constructed. Medicare is going bankrupt. It must be changed. There is no argument about that. The question is how: Do we want to raise taxes -- again! -- to pay for the program, or cut services and restrict choices -- again! -- to seniors? Or do we want to make changes that put trust in the somewhat messy and unpredictable genius of consumers operating in a competitive marketplace?
<P>	In this choice lies the whole battle. Raising taxes is how the Washington establishment has for decades "solved" problems. But this would leave in place a program that would continue to expand over time and suck in more and more tax dollars.
<p>	Restructuring the program so it operates more like business -- providing better services at lower cost -- is the solution that puts ordinary Americans back in charge.
<p>	Fortunately, the public has grown wary of big government. The public rejected  the Clinton administration's health-care plan, which would have put virtually the entire health-care system under the government's thumb through employer mandates, health-service alliances, draconian regulations, fines, penalties, and jail terms. Even though citizens knew -- and still know -- there are fundamental problems in the health-care system that need to be addressed, government control was and is not the answer. It wasn't the answer for the private sector, and it isn't the answer for Medicare.
<p>	After the voters overwhelmingly rejected the Clinton bill, they threw out many of the liberals in Congress who supported the plan. Now, liberals warn that the tables could turn on conservatives who dare to touch the sacred Medicare program.
<p>	Conservatives should not back down. Senior citizens are no different than other Americans who do not want government to run their lives; they want responsible government, and they want a government that recognizes their right to choose for thenselves.
<p>	Republicans won the battle against the Clinton health plan, and now they need to begin challenging the programs, like Medicare, that were built upon the same foundation. Major change cannot and should not come overnight. But conservatives should start now by making decisions that will lead to a more sustainable, more responsible, more efficient Medicare program in the next century.
<p>	Liberals know they can't win an open debate challenging Republicans' goals of cutting taxes and balancing the federal budget. They have to use a back door like Medicare to preserve paternalistic government programs. But conservatives can reform Medicare, balance the budget, and cut taxes, just as voters demanded.
<p>	The free market can easily give seniors better health care more efficiently than the government can. The big secret is: If we reform Medicare -- one of the few weapons left in the liberal arsenal -- the bigger battle will practically be won. A new course will be charted, and we will sail into a new era where government serves its citizens -- not the other way around.

<title>Renaissance Man -- Heritage </title>
<center>
<h2> Renaissance Man</h2>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html ">Edwin Feulner</a><br>

	I was telling some of my colleagues the other day about the remarkable career of my friend J. William (Bill) Middendorf II, and it occurred to me how few renaissance men grace today's world. It's our loss.
<p>	Today, Americans seem most impressed by two-sport athletes, billionaire investors, tell-all sex therapists, and actors, models and politicians who can chew gum and tie their shoelaces at the same time. Deion Sanders of Atlanta is a hero because he plays both professional baseball and football. When I was in college, 6-foot, 10-inch Gene Conley played center for the Boston Celtics, and during the off-season threw fastballs for the Red Sox. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls gave baseball a try, but several hundred feeble at-bats later decided to return full-time to his specialty.
<p>	I mean no disrespect toward professional athletes, but if this -- or the professional politicians who inhabit Washington and our state capitals -- constitute America's vision of the heroic man (and I include the distaff side here, too, of course) we are in big trouble.
<p>	The classic renaissance man is rare enough. Thomas Jefferson, our third president, was an architect, diplomat, lawyer, political philosopher, scientist and brilliant writer. He founded and designed the original campus of the University of Virginia, near his beloved Charlottesville estate, Monticello. Benjamin Franklin was a scientist and statesman, founder -- in 1794 -- of the U.S. Post Office, and among the co-authors, with Jefferson, of the Declaration of Independence. Theodore Roosevelt was a politician, statesman, conservationist, and outdoorsman. In 1906, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Russian-Japanese War. 
<p>	A wonderful new book, "The Sign of the Golden Grasshopper," by the late Perry Gresham (Jameson Books, $24.95), tells the story of Gresham's ancestral hero, Sir Thomas Gresham, the merchant adventurer who served as financial advisor to four British monarchs, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. (Gresham's law: "Bad money drives out good.") 
<p>	The book takes its name from the Gresham family coat of arms. Once reputed to be the richest man in England, Sir Thomas, when not advising monarchs or amassing fortunes, was a spy, royal smuggler, diplomat and early philanthropist. He is credited with almost single-handedly saving the realm (a fancy term for "the throne" to us non-Anglophiles) from its wealthier rival, King Philip II of Spain. He had a helping hand, of course, from Sir Francis Drake, the global explorer who in 1588 led the British fleet against Spain's supposedly invincible Armada (much of which ended up on the rocks off the coast of Ireland, thanks to heavy seas and bad weather.)
<p>	While Bill Middendorf has never been a spy or smuggler like Gresham, to the best of my knowledge many other titles certainly fit: diplomat, financier and philanthropist. An investment banker, now in his mid-70s, Middendorf served three U.S. presidents, as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Community.
<p>	But that's only the public man. He is also an art critic and historian, composer (of seven symphonies, an opera, and numerous marches, including the "Heritage Foundation March" and "U.S. Naval Academy March"), and an accomplished athlete: winning the national masters sculling championship in 1979 and the world masters rowing championship in 1985, at the age of 61. 
<p>	There are very few giants such as these on the scene today. Compared to the likes of Middendorf and Gresham, President Clinton is just another crafty lawyer turned career politician and Donald Trump is a four-bit speculator. 
<p>	What ever happened to greatness?

	Lt. Cdr. Kenneth Carkhuff was an outstanding Naval Academy graduate, ranked No. 1 in every command to which he was assigned after his 1982 commissioning, and only a year ago was praised by his commanding officer as "destined for command and beyond."<p>
	Now, the U.S. Navy wants to kick him out.
<p>	Why? Because Lt. Cdr. Carkhuff believes it is wrong to send women into combat. Such a view -- even if it doesn't affect Carkhuff in the performance of his duties -- is "not compatible with further military service," according to his now former commanding officer.
	<p>A Navy review board recently recommended that Carkhuff be discharged. Now President Clinton's Secretary of the Navy, John Dalton, must decide the future of an officer of obvious talent and firm faith.
	<p>Dalton faces no legal deadline to act, so he could simply allow the case to sit without comment on his desk. A Navy spokesman says, however, that this is "highly unlikely since we want a quality decision in a timely fashion."
	<p>Meanwhile, Lt. Cdr. Carkhuff and his family are twisting in the wind as legal bills pile up. If Secretary Dalton upholds the discharge, Carkhuff loses all Navy benefits, including his pension and health-insurance coverage.
	<p>This case raises disturbing questions about the Navy's hostility to those Americans who, like Carkhuff, base their opposition to women in combat on religious values.
	<p>Of Carkhuff's talent and devotion to duty there is no question. His commanding officer in the Navy's Helicopter Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Squadron 44, based at Mayport Naval Air Station in Florida, said in 1994 that Carkhuff  "earned my strongest possible recommendation for early promotion ahead of his peers."
	<p>But then President Clinton ordered the U.S. invasion of Haiti, which involved the participation of Squadron 44 and the unit's two female pilots.
	<p>Squadron 44's commander claims Carkhuff told him privately a few days before the invasion that he opposed sending women into combat, and that he requested transfer to an all-male unit.
	<p>Steven Gallagher, a former Navy officer who is now Carkhuff's attorney, says his client made it clear he would still lead his unit into combat if ordered to do so. "However, as a Christian, he felt the moral obligation to express his views," Gallagher says.
	<p>Carkhuff's keel-hauling is the latest example of the Navy's abject surrender -- in the wake of the infamous Tailhook Scandal of 1991 -- to the demands of feminists. Against the recommendation of the 1992 Commission on Women in the Armed Forces, the Navy decided early in the Clinton administration's first year to put women in front-line combat positions on board ships and in aircraft.
	<p>Now, the Navy must cope with tragedies like that of Kara Hultgreen, the first woman promoted to fly a Navy fighter jet, who was killed earlier this year while attempting a carrier landing. After first claiming that "engine failure" caused Hultgreen's crash, the Navy later admitted that pilot error was involved. Now they say Hultgreen was qualified for flight duty despite errors in previous carrier landings that would have disqualified male pilots.
	<p>A growing number of critics, both inside and outside the military, think the Navy is sacrificing too much on the altar of political correctness, including the high training standards that might have saved Hultgreen's life.
	<p>It's time for Congress to demand answers from the Navy and the Clinton administration, beginning with why Kenneth Carkhuff is being persecuted for expressing views held by most Americans and consistent with hundreds of years of military combat experience.

Now Even Carter Sees Through Aristide's Haiti</h2>
By John Tierney<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<p>
Opposition to President Clinton's boldest foreign policy initiative -- U.S. military intervention in Haiti last year with 21,000 troops at a cost of $3 billion --  has now come full circle. With the defection of former president Jimmy Carter as an uncritical supporter of the administration's effort to "restore" democracy to the Caribbean island, the White House's touting of Haiti as its greatest foreign policy "success" is sounding pretty silly.
<p>
The former president, who provided crucial political cover last year for Clinton's decision to dispatch U.S. forces to Haiti,  recently issued a devastating critique of the political process imposed under the lethal protection of U.S. guns by Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
<p>
The report, issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, exposes Aristide's one-party "Lavalas" rule, with its widespread corruption, mismanagement and ballot manipulating, particularly in the June 25 election. Aristide's allies swept local and parliamentary seats in that balloting.
<p>
President Carter's critique of Aristide is especially startling, considering the long political association between the two. When Aristide won Haiti's 1990 presidential election, the Carter Center was at the forefront of groups supporting the results.
<p>
But relations began to sour within months after Carter personally helped pave the way for Aristide's triumphant return in October 1994. By year's end, it was apparent to all but the most ideologically driven that Aristide was personally turning Haiti into yet another one-man dictatorship -- his own. This should surprise no one, considering Aristide's political personality and his Marxist beliefs.
<p>
A critical part of Aristide's plan for seizing total power in Haiti has been his illegal and authoritarian command of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) that conducted the fraudulent June election. Sensing trouble in March, Carter visited Haiti and was formally rebuffed by Aristide. Unofficially, he was greeted by hostile crowds and vicious graffiti, all engineered by Lavalas street gangs intent on embarrassing the former U.S. chief executive.
<p>
The Carter Center report on the ensuing election -- written by Carter confidant and former National Security Council advisor Robert Pastor -- documents the disgraceful conduct of the Aristide government and his Lavalas party. "Of the 13 elections I have observed, the June 25 Haitian elections were the most disastrous technically, with the most insecure count," Pastor  said in the report. "I personally witnessed the compromise of one-third of the ballot boxes in Port-au-Prince."
<p>
According to the report, the election was riddled with graft, fraud and chaos, with widespread irregularities, ballots burned, hundreds of voting stations never opened and tens of thousands of people never able to vote.
<p>
As an observer of the election on behalf of the International Republican Institute, I also observed the burning of ballots, counting irregularities and intimidation of  people seeking to vote by Lavalas groups. This was indeed a sham, a complete denial of democratic rule.
<p>
As might be expected, former President Carter is still looking for ways to "fix" Haiti. His report includes several constructive suggestions, including criteria for re-running the June election under  a revised CEP that includes more members who are independent of Aristide, improved ballot worker training, and creation of a new national task force on political reconciliation.
<p>
All of these are good ideas. But recent experience and a long history of corrupt Haitian politics indicate that the problems encountered by the Clinton-led U.S. intervention are deeply embedded in Haiti's political culture.
<p>
Thus, if nothing else, Aristide's rigged elections may at least have served the useful purpose of magnifying Haiti's long-standing problems for the rest of the world to see in something closer to their true light. 
<p>
As another former president said more than a century ago, "democracy is not created by aspirations or by new faith." Rather, said Woodrow Wilson, democracy "is built up by slow habit." By this time-tested measure, Haiti can hardly be called a democracy.

<title>Guess Who's Getting Your Tax Dollars? -- Heritage </title>

<h2>Guess Who's Getting Your Tax Dollars?</h2>
By<br> <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.</a><br>
</center>
<hr> 
<p>
So many Americans were fed up with business as usual in Washington that the leadership of Congress changed hands last November. The new leadership made specific promises to the American people in the Contract with America.
<p>
At least one government employee union -- the one representing state and local employees -- has labeled the Contract "evil" and lobbied against it in Congress earlier this year. Guess who paid for the union's lobbying? You did.
<p>
Washington gave the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) nearly $150,000 last year -- $150,000 that you and other taxpayers sent to Washington for the urgent needs of the nation.
<p>
You also sent Washington more than $250,000 that was given to the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) so it could tell Congress that "more children will be killed, more children will be raped" if the Contract with America becomes law.
<p>
The government's generosity with your money goes way beyond groups fighting the Contract with America. For example, $250,000 of your money was given to Families USA, one of the chief backers of the Clinton administration's failed health-care "reform" proposal last year.
<p>
Did anybody from AFSCME, CWLA or Families USA thank you for your generosity? I doubt it, since the underwriting of advocacy groups is one of Washington's dirty little secrets. The government gives your money to political and ideological groups whether you agree with them or not.
<p>
And we're not talking about just a few dollars. American taxpayers provided more than $39 billion to groups championing one cause or another between June 1993 and July 1994, according to a recent Heritage Foundation study. And nobody asked you or any other taxpayer if you want to contribute to any of these causes.
<p>
The reigning champions of this game are the National Council of Senior Citizens, which got $71 million (out of a total budget of about $75 million), and the American Association of Retired Persons, which received $73 million. Other organizations sharing in this bonanza included the AFL-CIO ($2 million), the Environmental Defense Fund ($515,000), the Consumer Federation of America ($610,000), the World Wildlife Fund ($2.6 million), and the League of Women Voters ($611,000).
<p>
Many of these groups are among the most active and visible advocates of more federal spending, higher federal taxes and increased regulation. Their representatives often testify before Congress, routinely provide favorable "public comment" to federal agencies on the latest new regulations, and are quoted regularly as "experts" in the news media.
<p>
To be sure, groups at all points of the political spectrum receive federal money. But by far the majority line up on the "tax and spend" side of things.
<p>
The fact is that during the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-exempt status, receive billions in federal handouts each year and aggressively lobby on Capitol Hill for bigger government and higher taxes.
<p>
In the old days, it was the Boss Tweeds of the big-city political machines handing out generous political favors. Today, Tweed is the unelected federal bureaucrat handing out billions of dollars worth of federal grants to those who want to maintain the status quo in Washington.
<p>
It's time to get the advocacy groups' hands out of your wallet. Thomas Jefferson put this issue well when he said: "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."
<p>
If special interests want your money, they should call and ask you for it. They shouldn't be allowed to take it out of your taxes.

<title>Flat Tax Critique -- Heritage </title>
<center>
<h2>
A Friendly Critique Of The Flat Tax</h2>
By J.D. Foster, Ph.D.<br>
August 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
<p></center>
Many people would like you to believe the flat tax is so named because it will flatten your finances. That, at least, is the intended conclusion from a flawed study recently released by the National Association of Realtors. 
<p>
By eliminating personal deductions like mortgage interest payments, the study claims, the flat tax would reduce housing values in this country by upwards of 10 percent. But the study's methodology is shaky at best, and the jury on housing values is still out.
<p>
Despite the forces allied against the flat tax, tax reform momentum has grown steadily because the current tax system is so unpopular and the alternatives promise so much. The leading contender, the flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, is easy to explain, addresses the need to increase savings and investment, and seems eminently fair to most people. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is attempting to trump the Armey plan with a "flat tax" that sets up five tax rates to Armey's one. 
<p>
But in addition to the possibility of lower housing values, the flat tax poses several other serious problems too easily dismissed by its advocates.
<p>
Businesses may be the flat tax's second biggest obstacle. By reducing the cost of compliance with the tax laws and removing uncertainties about their tax situation, the flat tax would eventually benefit businesses. However, they would see their tax burden rise by about two-thirds, on average, from around 31 percent of the total tax burden to around 50 percent. This tax increase on businesses would result from the loss of deductions for state and local taxes and for employee fringe benefits, among other things.
<p>
Though businesses will try to pass on these costs to consumers and employees -- by raising prices and trimming fringe benefits, for example -- shifting the nation's tax burden to the business community will not produce successful tax reform. 
<p>
Next, the flat tax initially would raise taxes on the middle class by 20 percent. On average, a family with between $40,000 and $50,000 in adjusted gross income would see their taxes rise by about $700 -- to about $7,500. Of course, Mr. Armey's plan calls for the tax rate to decline to 17 percent in its third year, but this happy event is contingent on about $400 billion of additional spending cuts beyond what the Congress has already called for to achieve a balanced budget. Far easier said than done.
<p>
The flat tax appears also to have a major fairness problem. Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in wages. Under the Armey flat tax, a 20 percent rate would cost this family $3,700. Now consider the Smiths, who in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital income is excluded from the tax base. To be sure, their dividend income was taxed at least once at the business level before they received it. But the perception would persist that a high-income family could pay no tax. Will tax fairness be defined so that individuals consuming significant amounts of capital income would pay little or no tax? 
<p>
Though difficult issues, they are not impossible to resolve. Moreover, the system's advantages could well outweigh its drawbacks. The flat tax could prove a boon for the economy by eliminating a passel of convoluted tax disincentives to saving and investing.  Economists will quibble over exact estimates, but there can be no question that saving and investment will improve in both the short and long run under a flat tax.
<p>
Advocates are correct to insist that the flat tax would be much simpler than the current tax system. The new system would tax only the income derived from individual labor, after allowing for personal exemptions. There would be no deductions. The flat tax would tax business' net cash income at the same rate that applies to individual income, while eliminating all the special tax provisions that penalize some businesses while benefiting others.
<p>
One big problem with the current system is that it costs from $150 billion to $300 billion annually to operate. The flat tax, by contrast, would cost about 1/15th as much once fully phased in. These cost savings are equivalent to more than a $100 billion tax cut for the American people.
<p>
No tax system is perfect, and no tax reform proposal is without flaws. In the end, the flat tax's greatest strength is that it would remove the current tax system's depressing effect on the economy. This, over time, could make up for all the problems mentioned above. 
<p>
But before it can pass, the problems will have to be addressed.

<TITLE>FEULNER - LAW OF OUR LAND -- Heritage </TITLE>

<hr>
<center>
<h2>Law of Our Land</h2>


By<br><a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.</a></center>
<p><hr><p>
	When the government favors the "rights" of snails, owls and rats over the constitutional rights of property owners, it's time to question Washington's priorities.
<p>	The Supreme Court ruled recently in Babbitt vs. Sweet Home Chapter Communities for a Great Oregon that the feds can keep private landowners from developing their property if disturbing the land might bother the bugs or animals living there. The ruling was a setback for property owners who have been trying to save their land from environmental extremists who see endangered species under every rock. Once a listed species -- anything from a Kangaroo rat to the infamous spotted owl  --  is found, your property rights may be in serious danger.
<p>	The Constitution's Fifth Amendment says no one will "be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation."
<p>	Because these rights aren't adequately codified in law, it has been left to the courts to provide protection.
<p>	The courts' rulings have been a mixed bag in recent years.  In 1992, for example, the Supreme Court held, in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, that denying an owner productive use of his or her land requires appropriate compensation.  This was a step in the right direction.  But litigation is costly.  Not everybody can afford to sue the government.  And victory is anything but guaranteed.
<p>	Consider the Walker family of Oregon.
<p>	Donald Walker Jr. had worked as a logger for 30 years until August 1989 when his timber company was forced to shut its doors. He received a notice from the Forest Conservation Council informing him he could no longer log the land he, his father and grandfather had worked. The spotted owl must have a place to roost  never mind the Walker family.
<p>	"I have never seen a spotted owl on our place, and I have never met anyone from the Forest Conservation Council. So far as I know, it's never even been on our farm. But I do have a typewritten, single-spaced, four-page letter from their lawyer saying that what we have been doing on our tree farm for 60 years is no longer legal ... The pressure on us now is hard to describe," Walker is quoted as saying.
<p>	Congress clearly needs to balance the legitimate rights of property owners against the continued encroachments of regulators.
<p>	According to Nancie Marzulla, president and chief legal counsel for Defenders of Property Rights, the Constitution's "just compensation" clause was meant to avoid making individual property owners bear the costs of "social goods," such as environmental protection, deemed to benefit society as a whole.
<p>	The choice, she stresses, does not have to be an "either-or": a livable environment or rapacious development. Bureaucrats must use common sense when designing environmental rules. And if the government feels it has a compelling need to keep business owners or individuals from using their property, it should compensate them -- just as the Constitution requires.
<p>	The House of Representatives earlier this year passed legislation as part of the Republican "Contract with America" allowing property owners to seek compensation for losses caused by federal restrictions on their land. Hearings have been held on a stronger companion bill in the Senate, known as the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995. A vote is expected in the fall.
<p>	These first steps toward recognizing property owners' legitimate rights is welcomed. Americans will know their government is just only when a new land law -- one that protects landowners -- becomes the law of the land.

<title>Rector -- How to Reform Welfare -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h2>HOW TO REFORM WELFARE</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a></center>
<p>
	In the battle over welfare reform, the blame game already has started. The White House stands ready to point the accusing finger at Congress if lawmakers dare to take the tough steps that are needed, while Congress cowers in fear at the thought of being blamed for "lack of compassion." 
<p>	But hope springs eternal. Just in case Washington decides it wants to forget politics and "just do it," as the saying goes, here are a few of the steps it can take to get welfare spending under control and break the cycle of dependency:<p>
<ol>
<li>	The growth of total welfare spending must be capped at 3 percent per year. One reason welfare spending is out of control is because there aren't any controls on it. In 1965, Americans paid about 1.5 percent of gross national product (GNP) for welfare. By 1993, they were paying more than 5 percent, or $324 billion. In just three years, we're projected to be paying around $500 billion, or about 6 percent of GNP. 
<p>	A 3 percent cap on the yearly increase in welfare spending would force state welfare bureaucracies to grapple with illegitimacy and dependency. And reformers should note: A 3 percent "cap" is still a yearly spending increase of 3 percent. It's not a cutoff.<p>
<li>	 Limit welfare benefits to unwed teenage mothers. Welfare makes it possible for young, unmarried women to have children and set up house as single parents. This is another reason welfare costs are skyrocketing. The welfare rolls increase geometrically year by year because many welfare children grow up to do the same thing their mothers did. This must stop. Statistically, children born out of wedlock are by far the most likely to fail in school, take drugs and engage in crime. 
<p>	Instead of paying money directly to unwed teenage mothers, the money they would have received through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps should be given to the states. States could develop programs to assist teenage mothers, including promoting adoption, orphanages or assisting young mothers in tightly-supervised group homes. Since other families don't receive increased income when they have additional children, neither should women on AFDC and/or Food Stamps. Eventually, direct federal payments to unwed mothers of all ages should be eliminated, so there is no longer a government reward for having children out of wedlock.<p>
<li>	 The law requiring mothers on AFDC to identify the father of their children, routinely ignored by welfare workers, should be enforced. Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's father beyond a shadow of doubt. Once paternity is determined, fathers should be required to pay child support to offset welfare costs. If a father claimed that he could not pay, the government could require him to perform community service.  <p> 
<li>	 Reduce welfare's marriage penalty. When couples on welfare marry, their benefits decrease. This discourages marriage and contributes to illegitimacy. A pro-marriage tax credit should be extended to low-income married couples who support dependent children and have at least one parent employed. The tax credit should be worth $1,000, and families paying less than that amount in federal taxes in any particular year should be able to receive the remainder of the credit in the form of a check from the government.<p> 
<li>	 Establish serious workfare. Previous welfare "reforms," including President Clinton's  recent proposal, have talked about workfare without requiring many people to work. Work requirements should be imposed first on able-bodied, non-elderly, single persons on welfare, followed by fathers in two-parent families and absent fathers who fail to pay child support. All able-bodied persons in the AFDC-UP and Food Stamp programs and half of all single mothers on AFDC -- those whose children are school age -- should have to work for their benefits.<p>   
<li>	 Pass school voucher programs as part of a broader effort to promote cultural renewal. Members of Congress must recognize three rules for escaping poverty in America; no one who follows them will be "chronically poor": a) finish high school; b) Get a job -- any job -- and stick with it; and c) Do not have children outside of marriage. </ol>
<p>	Ample research shows that the church is the institution best suited to instill the values that encourage these behaviors. School voucher programs would help churches play a greater role in molding America's youth. Poor parents should be able to take vouchers worth the sum spent on their children in public schools and use them at schools of their choice, including private, religious schools. Many low-income parents, trying to save their kids from violence, drugs and sexual promiscuity, would love to place them in church-based schools. If voucher plans were set up in cities, dozens of high-quality, private religious schools would spring up, operating as adjuncts of urban churches. 
<p>	Congress and the White House have an opportunity to convert the welfare system from a one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility in which welfare recipients are given aid but also are expected to contribute something to society for assistance given.    
<p>	Or, they can just keep playing politics.

<title> Trade Deficit Myths -- Heritage </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>TRADE DEFICIT MYTHS</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a></center>
<p>
	The Clinton administration's near collision with Japan over automobiles and auto parts almost started a trade war with America's second-largest trading partner.
<p>	Fortunately, the White House backed off from insisting on numerical targets in trade agreements, even though numerical purchasing quotas were the heart of its position. Thus, what was largely a defeat for Clinton's managed-trade policy is a victory for the American consumer.
<p>	But the president and his trade team may not have learned the larger lesson from their defeat. Underlying the Clinton administration's policies toward Japan is an irrational fear of trade deficits and the belief that protectionist policies are necessary to combat them.
<p>	In fact, myths and faulty assumptions about trade deficits are the intellectual foundation of the administration's managed-trade policies.
<p>	Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The meaning of the U.S. trade deficit is that Americans can afford to buy more goods than their foreign trading partners.  This is a sign of America's wealth. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth by increasing our standard of living; it does not detract from it.
<p>	The way protectionists see it, most people run a trade "deficit;" with their grocer.  When you go to the supermarket and buy $150 worth of groceries, protectionist theorists could chalk this up as a trade "surplus;" of $150 for the grocer, while you have a "deficit" of  $150. But this is not the case at all. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while you have $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. Both you and the grocer are winners.
<p>	Another misunderstanding involves trade-deficit figures. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade-deficit figure consists of U.S. imports from overseas subsidiaries of American companies. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import: a "deficit" supposedly is created. If the car is then sold in the United States, why should this still be calculated as part of the trade deficit? Most of the money made from this sale stays in the United States.
<p>	Protectionists claim trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment. History shows, however, that unemployment typically drops as the trade deficit rises.
<p>	For example, while the trade deficit leaped from 1983 to 1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate fell from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent 6.7 percent. When it began to rise from 1992 to 1994, unemployment shrank from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent.
<p>	U.S. policy-makers often use Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits by managing trade and industry. A closer look reveals that too much government "management" may be responsible for Japan's current economic malaise. If living standards are the measure of success, Japan has lost the "economic war" with the United States. For example, the real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is 30 percent to 40 percent lower than that of American consumers. Thus, the Japanese are at least one-third poorer than Americans.
<p>	Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to managed trade and industrial policies that drive up the costs of consumer goods.  For example, policies that restrict agricultural imports force the average Japanese family to spend about 25 percent of its disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans.
<p>	Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit. But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The United States exported more than $697 billion in goods and services in 1994.  By contrast, Germany exported $607 billion and Japan only $395 billion.  Clearly, most U.S. exporters find overseas markets for their goods.
<p>	Many trade-deficit "hawks" argue that the United States has an open market, while Japan restricts U.S. imports. Thus,  Japanese protectionism is the cause of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. In truth, Japan and the United States have relatively equal levels of protectionism.
<p>	Most Americans don't realize that Japan is the largest overseas market for U.S. goods and services. Last year alone, Japan imported $51 billion in goods from the United States.  That was more than America exported to the United Kingdom and Germany combined ($25.9 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively).
<p>	Moreover, on a per-capita basis, Japan buys more from the United States than the United States buys from Japan.  For example, on average, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.  But because Japan's population is about half of America's, a deficit exists.
<p>	Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy.  If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today.

<title>Meese - "Conference of the States" -- Heritage </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY WE NEED A "CONFERENCE OF THE STATES"</h3>
By <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese</a>
</center>
<p>
When Congress failed to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the federal 
budget -- something an overwhelming majority of Americans say they want -- it showed 
the power of Washington to derail ideas it doesnt like.    
<p>
Thats why 50 state governors are calling for a "Conference of the States": To 
hold Washington accountable to the people. But they are meeting stiff opposition from 
groups on both sides of the political spectrum. These groups have succeeded in 
convincing 14 state legislatures to reject or defer plans to attend the first such conference, 
forcing planners to postpone it until next year. 
<p>
Those on the left fear the Conference of the States because it might influence 
Congress to restrict federal power. They are correct; it could, and probably should. 
<p>
Others, mostly on the right, are concerned that the Conference of the States could 
become "a constitutional convention in disguise." These people -- most of whom favor 
balanced budgets and fiscal restraint -- fear that big-government liberals could take 
political control of such a gathering, call a constitutional convention, and alter Americas 
founding document along lines that would further entrench Washingtons power. Its 
important to set the record straight on what a Conference of the States is all about.
<p>
Its true: As Attorney General under President Reagan I learned firsthand that the 
federal bureaucracy is hostile to ideas like government accountability, civic participation, 
and federalism -- conservative values most Americans hold dear. Washington isnt going 
to reform itself. But that is precisely why a Conference of the States is a good idea. The 
only way America is going to re-assert control over a federal government that has 
overstepped its proper authority is if the states begin to assert their rights.
<p>
The balanced budget amendment is a case in point. Creating dependency by 
spending more money than it has -- and then leaving taxpayers with the bill plus interest -
- is one way Washington has been able to extend its tentacles of power. Voters are on to 
this game, and want the budget balanced. But Congress is under tremendous pressure --
from special interests that feed at the Washington trough -- to reject anything that would 
restrict the federal governments expansion. 
<p>
Which side usually wins out? Congress has consistently opposed balanced budget 
amendments in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and on March 2 in the Senate. 
<p>
This is why reform must be driven by the states. Sponsored by strictly bipartisan 
bodies such as the Council of State Governments, the National Governors Association 
and the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Conference of the States will be 
convened if 26 state legislatures vote to send delegations. It will bring together the 
nations 30 Republican and 20 Democratic governors, and all the nations state 
legislatures. The delegations then will try to figure out the best ways to go about re-
establishing a proper balance between state and federal power. 
<p>
The conference then will send its recommendations in the form of a "States Petition" back to the states. If a majority of legislatures approve the petition, it will then 
be sent to Congress, as non-binding advice on what federal lawmakers should do. The 
political consequences of ignoring such a petition would assure that it receives a fair 
hearing in the nations capitol. 
<p>
Renowned conservative jurists such as Judge Robert Bork assure us that it is 
impossible for the conference to become a constitutional convention. Article V of the 
U.S. Constitution says Congress must call any such convention, after it receives "the 
Application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states." In the Conference of 
the States, Congress will play no role at all.     
<p>
Indeed, the principal architects of the Conference, Republican Govs. Michael 
Leavitt of Utah and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and Democratic Govs. Ben Nelson 
of Nebraska and Howard Dean of Vermont, came up with the idea as a way to bring the 
states together without having to call a constitutional convention. By opposing this idea,  
conservatives may actually be helping ultra-liberal groups that dont want the conference 
because they want to keep Washington in control of  public policy.
<p>
Americas founders believed the fastest road to tyranny for the new United States 
would be if the prerogatives of state and local governments were usurped by a distant and 
overpowering national government. America has teetered on that precarious slope for 
decades. States now realize this, and are trying to restore balance. 
<p>
A Conference of the States could be an important step in that process. It deserves 
support from everyone.

AMERICA IS VULNERABLE TO MISSILE ATTACK
<P>
By Edwin Feulner
<P>
 President Clinton may be willing to close the street in front
of the White House to guard against fence climbers and potential
truck bombers. But he resolutely sticks his head in the sand when
it comes to the need to defend America against possible missile
attack.
<P>
 Recently, one of the president's top national security advisors
told Congress, in effect, &quot;don't worry, be happy,&quot; because
there isn't any nuclear threat now and probably won't be one for
many years to come. Thanks, I feel so much safer.
<P>
 Apparently, if Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Jan Lodal is
to be believed, the administration's policy is to build a missile-defense
system only after some rogue regime like North Korea or Iraq has
in its possession ballistic missiles capable of striking Portland,
Maine, Ogden, Utah, or some other U.S. town or city. 
<P>
 And even then, Lodal told lawmakers, according to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty -- a pact signed with the now defunct Soviet
Union -- America could only erect &quot;a limited defense.&quot;
And by the way, he added, the ABM pact also means we would have
to get Russia's permission before we start building!
<P>
 The fact is that the threat of a ballistic missile attack against
America's cities could become all too terrifyingly real very soon.
And, presently, America is undefended. 
<P>
 Just last year the Pentagon's top intelligence experts told Congress
for the first time that North Korea is developing a missile called
the &quot;Taepo Dong 2,&quot; with a range of  up to 6,000 miles,
which means it could strike New York or Boston.
<P>
 Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria -- not exactly known for their love
of America -- also are working on nuclear weapons and the rockets
to &quot;deliver&quot; them.
<P>
 The potential threat is real -- and complicated further by the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union. Nobody knows for certain
that disaffected members of the former Soviet Red Army won't sell
some rogue nation or terrorist group some of the 1,300-plus ballistic
missiles now &quot;controlled&quot; by Russia. All it takes is
one.
<P>
 The People's Republic of China has an estimated 100 ballistic
missiles. Its CSS-2, with a range of 1,860 miles, was recently
sold to Saudi Arabia. Fortunately, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally
-- but can President Clinton guarantee that the next CSS-2 buyer
will not be a Saddam Hussein? In a few years, the list of nations
capable of threatening the United States and its allies with ballistic
missiles is likely to expand to 20 or more. How long before somebody
pushes the button?
<P>
 Most Americans have no idea that if America's leaders decided
to do so, we could erect an effective missile-defense system within
five years, capable of protecting the entire United States at
a cost of only $4 billion to $5 billion.
<P>
 The United States should erect defenses against ballistic missiles
regardless of whether it &quot;violates&quot; the ABM Treaty,
or what the Russians think about it. America has a sovereign right
to defend herself. She should do so, and quit pretending the threats
aren't really out there. 
<P>

<h3>WASHINGTON'S SPENDING ON SPECIAL-INTEREST GROUPS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
 For all of Washington's new-found &quot;cost consciousness,&quot;
you'd be amazed how easy it is for special-interest groups to
find some taxpayer-funded &quot;money faucet&quot; -- turned on
by the last Congress -- that hasn't been turned off yet. You just
have to know where to look for them.
<P>
 And the threat of having your funding cut off or reduced can
really motivate you to look. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, when House Speaker Newt Gingrich eliminated
Congress' 28 special-interest caucuses -- the Congressional Black
Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, Textile Caucus, Steel Caucus, Arts Caucus,
etc. -- many of the groups began poking around for other ways
to get at your money. And many struck paydirt.
<P>
 Take, for example, the Black Caucus, which has its own foundation,
the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF). How does it
plan to continue its activities now that it can no longer do so
with your money?
<P>
 With your money. The Black Caucus Foundation currently is seeking
 $900,000 in private donations to match a $900,000 grant it's
expecting from the U.S. Commerce Department. The money allegedly
will be used to link members of the Black Caucus to &quot;the
5000+ African-American city, state and county legislators and
officials, and African-American public policy organizations, to
provide information produced by the CBCF, other policy organizations,
and pertinent information produced on Capitol Hill that impacts
the delivery of service at the local government level.&quot; 
<P>
 That's Washingtonese for saying  that &quot;government money
will be channeled through the CBCF in order to link members of
the Black Caucus with their political constituency,&quot; to quote
my friend John P. Walters in a report by his New Citizenship Project.
How does CBCF plan to establish this link? Why, through the Internet.
That's where Commerce comes in.
<P>
 The Commerce Department runs a program called the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP), as
part of Vice President Al Gore's attempt to have government micro-manage
the &quot;information superhighway.&quot; One of the Clinton administration's
main goals in establishing TIIAP was to develop a telecommunications
component for the Clinton health-care plan. That plan didn't pan
out, but this didn't stop the government from giving out $24.4
million in TIIAP grants in 1994. Nor did it stop the 103rd Congress
from appropriating $64 million for TIIAP for 1995, or the administration
from requesting $99.9 million for 1996. 
<P>
 Somebody left the money faucet running. This &quot;cyberpork&quot;
program has yet to be targeted for extinction by the GOP Congress.
And the special interests are rushing in to lap up the runoff.
This is just one example, there are many others.
<P>
 Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not against there being a Congressional
Black Caucus, or any other kind of special-interest caucus. I
just question whether taxpayers should have to pay for them. 
<P>
 And just so you know I'm willing to put my money where my mouth
is, bear in mind that early in my Washington career I served as
staff director for the House Republican Study Committee. We did
a lot of good work, and the committee's efforts over the years
were instrumental in providing intellectual fodder for the conservative
takeover of Congress last November. 
<P>
 With my blessing, and in all fairness, Speaker Gingrich and the
new Congress cut off funding for the Study Committee -- along
with the 27 other special-interest caucuses -- and it was disbanded.
<P>
 Do you think that one went looking for government handouts?
<P>

PRIVATIZING THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
<P>
By Ronald D. Utt
<P>
 Politicians have been &quot;reforming&quot; Washington's General
Services Administration (GSA) for more than 15 years, yet waste
and inefficiency still plague the government's central housekeeping
agency. It's time to try something radically new like privatization.
<P>
 Breaking GSA up into its major functional parts, then selling
them to private companies working with groups of  the agency's
former employees would clean up the current mess. How big a mess
it is can be seen in the fact GSA charges government agencies
$2.21 for the same dozen BIC pens a private-sector firm sells
for 89 cents!
<P>
 The need to fix GSA -- often the focus since 1978 of wide-ranging
probes by government investigators and media exposes of fraud
and abuse -- is so obvious that even the National Performance
Review led by Vice President Gore said big changes are needed
in the agency.
<P>
 Doing something about GSA is important because its 18,500 employees
manage more than 268 million square feet of space in 8,000 federally-owned
or leased office buildings and warehouses.
<P>
 GSA's basic problem since it was created in 1949 has been its
legalized monopoly on providing support services to government
offices and office workers. This monopoly is why GSA's annual
$200 million annual operating budget is deceptive. Acting as a
middleman for other federal agencies, GSA actually controls about
$50 billion worth of  building leases and purchases, building
services, office supplies, telecommunications, and computer equipment.
<P>
 Gore's performance review said ending GSA's monopoly would make
the agency more efficient because it would then have to compete
for business from federal agencies just like a private-sector
company. If GSA became 25 percent more efficient than it is now,
the annual budget savings would be about $12.5 billion.
<P>
 But why stop there when GSA's own experience proves how much
more could be saved by privatization? According to the General
Accounting Office, between 1982 and 1992, GSA reviewed 731 commercial
activities carried out by its Public Building Service for contracting
out to the private sector.
<P>
 Ultimately, 73 percent of the activities reviewed were privatized.
On average, the low contractor bids received by GSA were 39 percent
lower than the government's own cost for doing the same activities.
For custodial services, the low contractor's bid was 50 percent
less than the government's cost estimate.
<P>
 Similarly significant savings will result from privatizing other
parts of GSA. Last year, several private firms reviewed the potential
savings from renegotiating federal building leases. They concluded
that government could spend as much as 25 percent less on rent
each year through such competition.
<P>
 So great and so certain are these potential savings that private-sector
firms have proposed taking over GSA's property-management functions
at no direct cost to the government, paying themselves only from
the savings they achieve for taxpayers.
<P>
 It is important that GSA's employees share in the fruits of privatization
as the various parts of the agency are taken over by private-sector
companies. The Federal Employee Direct Corporate Ownership  Opportunity
Plan (FED CO-OP), developed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
during the Reagan administration, provides a model.
<P>
 FED CO-OP sets up an &quot;Employee Stock Ownership Plan&quot;
jointly-owned by a contractor with employees working on a particular
activity being contracted out to the private sector. Employees
would thus be able to participate in the profits of the firms
that win contracts to take over GSA's commercial activities. The
program also provides guaranteed employment for a limited time
and high-quality out-placement services for employees who leave
the new firm within the first year after privatization.
<P>
 Fortunately, GSA should be the easiest federal agency to privatize
because its many services are available from the private sector,
whose many successful firms provide a blueprint for how a privatized
GSA could not merely survive, but thrive in a competitive environment.
<P>

<TITLE>Welfare: It Keeps Growing and Growing... -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER>
<h3>WELFARE: IT KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING AND ...</h3>
<P>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</CENTER>
<P>
 As Congress and the White House get down to the serious business
of reforming America's welfare system, it might be useful to figure
out how we got in the mess we're in. After all, when President
Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty back in 1965, he didn't
envision an open-ended expansion of the welfare state.  
<P>
 Johnson's vision of  a &quot;temporary&quot;  investment to help
the poor become self-sufficient and climb into the economic mainstream
has turned into a bureaucratic and fiscal nightmare whose  total
cost has been calculated at $5.4 trillion.
<P>
 Just how did this burgeoning welfare state develop?  
<P>
 America's descent into the welfare abyss is a relatively recent
development. For the first 150 years of its existence, the U.S.
government played a very minor role in welfare. &quot;Charity&quot;
was conducted mainly by private religious organizations. In 1929,
for example, total federal, state and local welfare costs were
just $90 million, or about $800 million in today's dollars.  
<P>
 Welfare work relief programs -- the Civilian Conservation Corps,
the Public Works Administration and others -- created to deal
with the harsh effects of the Great Depression, fueled an increase
in welfare spending to $46.6 billion in 1939. However, by the
start of World War II, most of the these Great Depression anti-poverty
programs had been terminated and welfare spending remained low
during the post-war years.
<P>
 During the 1950s and early 1960s, welfare spending grew slowly.
But starting in 1965 -- a year after President Johnson declared
War on Poverty -- new programs began an unprecedented proliferation
based on the concept of &quot;entitlement&quot;; older ones expanded
eligibility requirements. In just three years -- from 1965 to
1968 -- yearly welfare spending more than doubled, from $38.3
billion to $80.5 billion in today's dollars. 
<P>
 Between 1965 and 1975, yearly spending on cash aid welfare programs
nearly tripled; social-service spending did triple; medical aid
almost quintupled; food aid did quintuple; housing programs increased
sevenfold; and job-training funds increased fifteenfold! By 1975,
total yearly welfare spending had reached $119.4 billion, nearly
five times as much as a decade earlier. (All these figures are
adjusted for inflation.) By 1993, combined federal and state welfare
spending on poor and low-income persons had risen to $324 billion
per year.
<P>
 One way to get a grip on how quickly welfare has expanded is
to compare welfare spending with spending on other programs and
functions of government:
<UL>
<LI>In 1965, the United States spent just 17 cents on welfare
for each dollar spent on national defense. By 1993,  spending
on welfare had surpassed defense, rising to $1.11 for each defense
dollar. By the year 2000, America will be spending twice as much
on welfare as defense.  
<LI>In 1965, we spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar spent
by all levels of government on primary, secondary and post-secondary
education. By 1993, welfare  costs were 91 cents per education
dollar.
<LI>In 1965 the United States spent 51 cents on welfare for each
dollar spent on Social Security and Medicare. By 1993, the figure
was 77 cents in welfare costs for each Social Security and Medicare
dollar. 
<UL>
<LI>At the beginning of the War on Poverty, welfare spending absorbed
about 1 percent  of the gross domestic product (GDP). By 1993,
welfare spending was taking up  more than 5 percent of GDP.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
  And if current projections are to be believed, the situation
is only going to get worse. According to Congressional Budget
Office projections:
<UL>
<LI>Annual federal welfare spending will rise from $272.1 billion
in 1995 to $387.3 billion in the year 2000.
<LI>Combined federal and state welfare spending will rise from
$378.7 billion in 1995 to $551.7 billion in the year 2000. 
<LI>Between 1996 and 2000, the federal government will spend $1.6
trillion on welfare.
<LI>Add the cost of welfare to the states and that number increases
to $2.38 trillion. 
</UL>

<P>
 This kind of growth simply can't be sustained. That realization
-- on Capitol Hill and in the White House -- is one of the reasons
serious reform finally is being discussed.  What remains to be
seen is whether lawmakers are ready to take the political heat
for the total overhaul needed to bring welfare spending under
control.

<title>Government Relations -- Heritage Departments</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><IMG SRC="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></a></center>

<h2>Government Relations</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Led by Vice President Michael Franc, the twelve-member staff of The Heritage Foundation's Government Relations Department serves as an institutional link between the Heritage research team and the policymaking community, providing Congress and the Executive Branch with timely information and policy recommendations on matters of current interest.  House Liaison <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Senate Liaison <a href="/heritage/staff/carter.html">Mary Anne Carter</a> meet daily with Congressional staff to educate them on research findings.
<p>
The staff prides itself on being on top of the hot issues, in contact with key Members and staff, and in delivering important policy information in a timely, easy-to-use manner.  Additionally, Mason and staff are regularly contacted by the media to discuss Heritage analysis of current issues.
<p>
Since 1992, the Candidate Education Project has made our analysts and research  available to Democratic and Republican congressional and presidential campaigns. The first year the Department received calls from over 130 campaigns. The number rose to over 235 campaigns in 1994. For the 1996 election cycle, we have already received calls or visits from 30 campaigns. The grand finale of the Candidate Education Project is the New Members' Orientation Conference. All freshmen Members, their spouses and Chiefs of Staff are invited to this three-day issues seminar in early December, following the elections. The 1994 Conference hosted 60 Members and forced the cancellation of the traditional freshman orientation conference at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
<P>
Directed by <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, the Government Reform Project includes Union Watch, the Government Integrity Project, and the Congress Project.  Union Watch examines the political activities of labor unions.  Although organized labor's political efforts are generally funded through compulsory union dues, public opinion surveys regularly indicate that the agenda promoted by labor leaders is often at odds with the views held by the union rank and file.  The <a href="/heritage/library/index/h3.html">Government Integrity Project</a> seeks to highlight the practice of permitting tax- exempt organizations which engage in political or legislative advocacy to receive funds from the federal government. Weinstein also directs Heritage's effort to reform Congress, enact term limits and promote campaign finance reform.  Former Congress Project Director Dave Mason oversaw the publication of the book <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">"The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial Congress"</a>.
















<p>
Under the direction of Karen Miller, Heritage participates in the  <a href="/heritage/
jobs/jobs.html">Conservative Placement Network</a>. Since its inception in 1991, 
Heritage has helped place hundreds of conservatives in public policy positions.
<p>
In conjunction with Heritage's Research Department, the Government Relations staff has contributed to many publications, such as <a href="/heritage/issues96/tblcon.html"><i>Issues `96</i></a>, <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html"><i>Issues '94: The Candidate's Briefing Book</i></a>, <i>The 
New Member's Guide To The Issues</i>, <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/roll.html"><i>Rolling Back Government: A Budget Plan 
to Rebuild America</i></a>, and <i>Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for 
Rural Prosperity</i>. These timely publications are distributed to targeted congressional 
lists and congressional briefings are arranged.

<P>
<H2>Public Relations: Popularizing Conservative Ideas</H2>
<P>
 <HR>
<P>
 An integral part of  The Heritage Foundation's marketing program,
the Public Relations Department has as its mandate to popularize
and legitimize Heritage policy prescriptions and the broader conservative
vision of government.  Understanding the importance of marketing
is one of the things that makes Heritage different from other
policy institutes.
<P>
 Providing the media with information and commentary on the issues,
ideas, politics and policies of Washington, the Public Relations
Department also flags key issues that are likely to dominate the
policy debate in the near future, and makes sure the media never
has an excuse for not quoting a credible conservative on a key
policy matter.
<P>
 A long-time favorite of  talk radio, Heritage, in 1994, opened
new broadcast facilities to meet the growing demand.  With state-of-the-art
equipment, the studio enables talk show hosts to do live broadcasts
from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.  Heritage has become
a &quot;home away from home&quot; for dozens of talk show hosts
visiting the nation's capital to broadcast their shows.
<P>
 Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast
media program, began several years ago -- long before most other
organizations realized the potential impact of this alternative
communications medium.  Heritage experts have made literally hundreds
of guest appearances on radio talk shows, on major television
and  public affairs shows, and on the America's Talking, CNN,
CNBC, C-Span, and NET call-in shows.  Heritage lectures also are
frequently seen on C-Span.
<P>
 The Heritage &quot;op-ed&quot; page program gives Heritage analysts
and executives an opportunity to present their views on the important
issues of the day without having to go through the usual news
&quot;filtering&quot; process.  Heritage bylines regularly appear
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Washington Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>
and <i>New York Times</i>.
<P>
 While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass
media, targeted communications are also an important part of the
program.  The Speakers Bureau, for example, helps bring Heritage's
conservative message to college campuses and business, professional,
and civic organizations (for more information see the <A HREF="/heritage/spkbur.html">Speakers Bureau</A>).  Heritage also is the home of  the
Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press, an organization
of Washington-based Asian correspondents.

<p>
<H2> Information Marketing Department</H2>
<HR>
<P>
Heritage has created the new Information Marketing department to provide members of Congress, congressional staff, and others in the public policy arena with new ways to access Heritage ideas.
<P>
Information Marketing operates Heritage's popular Web site, <a href="/heritage"><i>www.heritage.org</i></a>, which puts the <a href="/heritage/library">library</a> of Heritage research, free of charge, at the fingertips of everyone with access to the Internet. It also publishes the papers and books that Heritage analysts produce in a variety of ways, both electronically and in print, all designed to facilitate access to Heritage's ideas. Information Marketing produces CD-ROMs, charts, slides, and transparencies, as well as a number of other derivative products. One new format is the "policy pocket card," which provides factual digests of Heritage's most important papers. Members of Congress and their staff have found the cards useful to provide quick references for speeches or to address inquiries from constituents or the media. Early in 1997, Heritage will install a new service to provide faxes of our papers on call 24 hours a day.
<P>

Information Marketing also works with all departments at Heritage to develop themes and focus for domestic and foreign policy issues, and it helps to coordinate activities, products, and events at Heritage to maximize their impact. All of Information Marketing's activities are directed at providing you with the information you need in the form you need it -- <I>whenever</I> you need it. Information Marketing continually conducts research to help Heritage more effective produce the products that target Heritage's ideas and focus research on those issues that that advance conservative ideas.
<P>
Please call Heritage's Publication Sales office at (202) 608-6260 or send e-mail <a href="mailto:pubs@heritage.org">pubs@heritage.org</a> to receive copies of any Heritage publication. Or log on to <a href="/heritage/"><i>www.heritage.org</i></a> to download the publications you need at any time of day.
<P>

For a more thorough description of the Information Marketing department, or to suggest additional information products that would be helpful to you, please contact Ann Klucsarits at (202) 608-6188, or email <a href="mailto:klucsaritsa@heritage.org">klucsaritsa@heritage.org</a>

<TITLE>Educational Affairs Department -- Heritage</TITLE>


</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><IMG SRC="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></a></center>
<P>
<H2>Educational Affairs Department</H2>
<HR>
<P>
 The Educational Affairs department includes <A HREF="/heritage/p_review/">
 <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></A>,
the quarterly journal of The Heritage Foundation, <A
HREF="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and
Seminars</A>, and Academic Programs. The Heritage Foundation's academic
programs are intended to encourage the interchange of ideas between
scholars and policymakers, while building a national network of
conservative scholars and educational leaders committed to academic
excellence and the principles of liberty and constitutional order.
<P>
<B>The Bradley Fellows Program</B>
<P>
 The Bradley Fellows Program at The Heritage Foundation is intended
to enable scholars and academically rigorous journalists to conduct
a long-term research project in Washington, D.C., and to produce
a book important to the future of the conservative movement. 

<P>
 Each author is in residence at The Heritage Foundation for one
academic year, during which time he or she is expected to complete
all or most of their book.  In addition to their individual research
projects, Bradley Scholars hold roundtable discussions at Heritage,
and add their academic expertise to Heritage's general intellectual
environment. Each Bradley Fellow will receive a one year stipend,
plus funds to cover expenses and materials needed to support their
work.  During and after the scholar's residency at Heritage, our
marketing departments will communicate the author's ideas to Capitol
Hill and the media.  Books are to be published commercially.
<P>
 Current Bradley Fellows are writing on practical solutions to
the crime problem in American neighborhoods, black churches that
are successfully strengthening local communities; and a conservative
model of corporate social responsibility. The Heritage Foundation
is currently interested in supporting work in, but not necessarily
limited to, the following six subject areas: How Immigrants Become
Americans (An examination of the institutions that historically
assimilated foreigners into the American mainstream); The Economic
Revival of Communities (A look at communities whose economies
have revived after terrible social and economic setbacks ); The
Other Washington (An examination of civil society in Washington,
D.C. in the shadow of both federal and city government bureaucracy);
The Case for Raising the Retirement Age (Examining the economic
and medical benefits of a later retirement age); Family, City,
State, Nation (A major philosophical work, written for a large
audience, that would explore which areas of policy are appropriate
for the federal government, which should be left for state government,
which for local government, and which shouldn't be handled by
government at all); Alternatives to Federal Funding of Scientific
Research; and Alternatives to Federal Funding of the Arts.
<P>
 The Bradley Fellows are chosen in an informal competition, based
on individual qualifications and project proposals.  Please direct
further questions or mail your proposal directly to the Manager
of Academic Programs at The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002.  The Bradley Program is
made possible by a grant from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
<P>
<B>The Salvatori Fellows Program</B>
<P>
 Through the Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership, The Heritage
Foundation assists those faculty and educational leaders who are
committed to the renewal of academic excellence and the recovery
of our nation's founding principles so as to encourage an enlightened
patriotism and bolster the foundations of liberty in America.
<P>
 Each year the Salvatori Center selects twenty-five young faculty
and doctoral candidates in the social sciences and the humanities
to participate in a ten-day summer colloquium which takes place
in Washington, D.C., entitled &quot;The Foundations of American
Liberty.&quot;  The colloquium examines the fundamental principles
of American constitutionalism as articulated in the important
documents of the founding era.  In addition, the colloquium considers
the history and present workings of our political institutions
-- the Congress, the courts, the presidency and the executive
branch bureaucracy, the two-party system -- as a means of better
understanding the principles underlying contemporary political
issues.  It includes meetings with congressional leaders and other
policymakers to study the role of ideas in public affairs and
the character of political leadership in American society.
<P>
 Each Salvatori Fellow receives an honorarium, travel expenses,
and a per diem allowance as a participant in the colloquium. 
After the completion of the program, Fellows will continue their
affiliation with The Heritage Foundation as members of a national
network of adjunct scholars, colleagues in the ongoing work of
reclaiming our educational institutions and enlivening the public
discussion of American principles. 
<P>
 For application information, please call write to the Manager
of Academic Programs, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002.  Applications require a
vita, references, a writing sample and a pr&eacute;cis of the
dissertation (for Ph.D. candidates).  The application and attachments
are due by February 15. The Salvatori Program is made possible
by a grant from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles,
California.
<P>
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html"><B>The Heritage Internship Program</B></a>

innovative college students to the policy-making process, involve
them in the important questions and issues of the day and encourage
them to become active and effective participants in public affairs.

<P>
 Each summer, The Heritage Foundation selects approximately forty

and humane approaches to substitute care. She advises governors, other policy 
makers and opinion leaders on practical steps that must be taken to 
restructure foster care and adoption and help tens of thousands of children 
find permanent families.

<P>
Born and raised in Northern California, Ms. Craig graduated with honors 
from Harvard College. At Harvard she wrote her honors thesis on the 
relationship between research and legislation on child abuse.  In the 
course of her research, she traveled across the United States, meeting 
not only with experts in child protective services but also with children 
in foster care, group homes and shelters. She met many children who, 
temporarily or permanently separated from their families of origin, 
languished for months or even years in state-run care. Her deep and 
abiding interest in discovering how best to serve these children led 
her to investigate how other countries approach substitute care. Ms. 
Craig has lived in Japan as a Harvard Graduate Fellow; there she studied 
child abuse and related issues. She has traveled throughout the world to 
research foster care and adoption practices; most recently, she has advised 
legislators and scholars in China, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea and the 
United Kingdom.

<P>
Ms. Craig's commitment to rebuilding foster care and adoption is rooted 
in her belief that children get a better start in life with a family and a 
loving, permanent home and that indeed every child deserves such a foundation. 
Adopted into a family that has to date cared for 110 foster children, Ms. 
Craig has spent her entire life involved in and very much aware of the 
"client" side of the foster care equation.

<TITLE>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN</TITLE>


<H2><CENTER>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN</CENTER></H2>

<H3><CENTER>CURRENT PROGRAMS - SUMMER 1995</CENTER></H3>


<P>The <B>INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN, INC.</B> creates and promotes innovative 
policies on foster care and adoption in America. What makes these 
policies "innovative" is a shift of focus away from building 
bureaucracies and toward helping children. The well-being of many 
thousands of youngsters depends on such innovation: across the nation 
50,000 children who could be adopted today are languishing in state-run 
foster care. The Institute for Children, a private, charitable organization, 
is reshaping foster care and adoption to make sure every child has a 
permanent, loving home.


<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Institute for Children is advising leaders. The Institute' s 
starting-point strategy plan, "What a Governor Can Do to Make Foster 
Care and Adoption Work," was one of the driving forces behind Governor 
William Weld' s November 1993 initiative, Assignment Adoption - A Home 
for Every Child.
</UL>
<I>The initiative has expedited adoption for many Massachusetts children: 
the number of 	foster child adoptions 
in the state has increased by 47% in one year, from 725 in 1993 to 
1,068 in 1994. The plan is now being studied in other states.
</I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Institute is extending its reach to governors across the nation and 
 to federal leaders, including members of the U.S. Senate, as today's 
 policy makers launch adoption and foster care reform.
<P>
<LI>The Institute is addressing urgent questions about foster care in its 
upcoming report, "21 Questions on Foster Care," to be co-published with 
the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis.
<P>
<LI>The Institute is creating blueprints for change. With the Reason 
Foundation (Los Angeles), the Institute will soon co-publish 
"Private-sector approaches to foster care," a how-to guide for state 
and local governments. The guide assesses the results of model programs 
in five states.
<P>
<LI>The Institute for Children is changing the rules that keep children in 
foster care for too long. The Institute is working with the Institute for 
Justice, a public interest litigation group in Washington, D.C., to develop 
targeted lawsuits brought on behalf of foster children who are legally free 
to be adopted yet -- because of regulatory and practice barriers -- are 
forced to spend months or even years waiting for permanent adoptive families.
<P>
<LI>The Institute' s president, Conna Craig, has been asked by a prominent 
publisher to write a book on foster care in America. The book will examine 
the history, scope, complexities, outcomes and costs of state-run substitute 
care. The purpose of the book is to add depth to the debate on how to best 
care for America' s parentless children and, ultimately, to spark the types 
of policy changes that will wrest children from long-term state care and 
allow them to grow up in permanent families.

<center><h2> Citizens at Bat: Baseball's Community All-Stars </h2>
<b>By Frank Fitzpatrick</b>
<p>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
<a href="toc.html">July-August 1996, Number 78</a></i>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Poor battered <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com">baseball</a>. It's got more problems than the Detroit Tigers pitching staff. Among Generation X's favorite sports, it ranks somewhere between beach volleyball and Mortal Kombat. Its TV ratings resemble Greg Maddux's earned-run average, and you can count its marketable superstars on one of Ken Griffey Jr.'s fingers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But baseball is tops in one dubious category. There are unquestionably more boors in baseball than in any other sport. As the game battles to repair its tattered image, its legion of louts just battles--their fans, reporters, opposing players, even themselves. They rebuff autograph-hunters. They berate sportswriters (when they aren't hiding from them). They charge the mound whenever a pitcher dares to throw inside. And some even abuse themselves with alcohol and drugs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Fortunately, this isn't the whole story.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There are many players who are doing much more than keeping tabloid reporters gainfully employed. They are as committed to their performance off the baseball diamond as on--old-fashioned role models for kids hungry to see even one adult stand by his word.	These players are using their resources and influence to help some of the neediest in their communities. Though most promote charitable causes, they are not merely mannequins on display for some local charity. Performance-based contributions--a homer for the heart association, a save for the Salvation Army, a grand slam for Goodwill--are fine as far as they go. But they do little to connect players with real people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The players profiled below have found causes they believe in and turned themselves into vigorous and effective advocates. And they do not do so in the Hollywood style--joining a cause-of-the-month club, strutting into congressional offices or the White House to plead for a new government program or grant. It doesn't seem to have occurred to these men to ask government agencies or politicians to lend a hand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	No, these celebrities are founding scholarship programs to give needy children a shot at college. They are small businessmen determined to create jobs where they live. They are mentors walking into inner-city classrooms and playgrounds and turning dust and debris into dreams. They're committed husbands and fathers for whom the word "sacrifice" means more than a way to advance a base runner.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	They are, in short, productive citizens.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not all jerks," says pitcher Jeff Montgomery, of the <a href="http://www.kcroyals.com/">Kansas City Royals</a>. "A lot of us know that we have a responsibility not just to our teammates or to the fans at the games, but to the entire community."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Here are nine prominent baseball players--call them "all-stars in citizenship"--that constitute an impressive lineup of caring athletes:<p><b>Jim Eisenreich</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/nl/phi"><I>Philadelphia Phillies</I></a>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
It was 11 a.m. on a game day. On the upper floors of Montreal's Le Centre Sheraton hotel, "Do Not Disturb" signs hung outside the rooms of most Philadelphia Phillies. At that moment, Jim Eisenreich was a long way from his sleeping teammates. He was sitting in a home in a distant Montreal suburb. There, a nine-year-old victim of Tourette's Syndrome, his face and body twitching violently, listened as the ballplayer tried to comfort him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I've got a mission with these kids," says Eisenreich, his own Tourette's symptoms harnessed by medication. "I try to show them they can dream too."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The illness, which now afflicts about a million people a year, is a genetically transmitted neurological disorder that causes vocal tics and muscle twitches. This particular youngster's problems were so pronounced, he had stopped attending school. Not long after Eisenreich's lengthy visit, he returned.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Frustration, pain, and depression had infected his entire family," says Sue Levi, medical and scientific director for the Tourette's Syndrome Association. "Jim spent 90 minutes with that child and, according to the mother, the discussion literally changed her son's life. He was able to talk about his problems openly afterward and was a happier, more relaxed kid."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It is a story repeated wherever the Phillies travel. Eisenreich, whose own childhood was marred by the disorder and whose baseball career was interrupted by it, meets kids with Tourette's in every National League city. He escorts the youngsters and their families into baseball's inner sanctums, answers their questions, and, most importantly, concludes each session with a message.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"My job is to be a good ballplayer who helps his team win. But it's equally important that I help these kids," says Eisenreich. "I believe that's God's plan for me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Phillies outfielder has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Tourette's causes and touched thousands of lives. Each week, he personally responds to as many as a hundred letters from victims of the disorder.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Sometimes, on the road, I'm up till 2 or 3 in the morning writing letters," says Eisenreich, who stands among baseball's most dependable utility players. "But I'd be in my hotel room anyway. I don't go out. I'm not a party person."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Now among the sport's most admired and well-liked players ("If you can't get along with Eisy, you're the one with the problem," says Phillies coach John Vukovich), Eisenreich had few friends growing up in Minnesota. "Other kids couldn't understand why I was making these strange noises and movements," he says. "They used to make fun of me. Their parents didn't like them playing with me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But Eisenreich could play baseball, and by 1982 he was a Minnesota Twins rookie hitting above .300. The pressures of big-league baseball aggravated his problem, though, and in three big-league seasons he appeared in only 48 games. One night in Boston he actually walked off the field; after only 12 games in 1984, he walked away from baseball.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Everyone assumed psychological problems drove Eisenreich from the game until a Minnesota specialist diagnosed Tourette's. Three years later, armed with new medicine that gave him some respite from the twitching, Eisenreich began a comeback. He was traded to the Phillies in 1993 and ended that season by homering in Game 2 of the World Series. By then, when his story was well known, he had committed himself to helping others with the disorder.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If I could ask one thing of people, it would be acceptance of us," he says. "They need to understand that we have no control over this."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Eisenreich and his wife, Leann, recently began the Jim Eisenreich Foundation for Children with Tourette's Syndrome, based in Kansas City, Missouri, his winter residence. Their goal is to establish a nationwide network of clinics where the afflicted can get counseling, support, and medical assistance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I don't want these kids to have to go through everything I did," Eisenreich says. "This work I do is my responsibility to them."<p><b>Dave Valle</b><br><a href="http://www.texasrangers.com/"><I>Texas Rangers</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Dave Valle's life changed 13 years ago amid a crowd of ragged youngsters at a ballpark in the Dominican Republic.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	As a 23-year-old playing winter ball in the hopes it would hasten his rise to the major leagues, Valle and his wife were met one night by a crowd of youngsters as they exited Santo Domingo's ballpark. It was hardly the Nike-clad, autograph-seeking crowds that big-league players encounter outside American stadiums.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"These kids had no shoes and very little clothing. They looked malnourished and they were begging for food," says Valle. "Right then I told my wife that if I was ever in a position to do so, I would come back here and help."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Two years ago, Valle and ex-Mariners pitcher Brian Holman decided that time had come. They founded Esperanza International (from the Spanish word for "hope"), solicited money, and sought advice on how the nonprofit agency could best deploy the funds in the Dominican Republic. "What we decided on was a program of microlending to women in the poorest of areas," says Valle. "We knew that to help the children, we had to help the women. In that culture, it's the women who are really involved in the nurturing of children. And the way it was there, unless they begged, stole, or sold their bodies, the children didn't eat."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Dominican women borrowed about $110 apiece. "That goes a long way there," says Valle. Holman, Valle, and other volunteers helped them start small businesses. Some sold chickens, a few did laundry, still others made articles of clothing. "We charged them 2.3 percent interest and they were required to save 10 percent of the loan's value while they were repaying it," says Valle.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The women borrowed money in groups of 15 to 20. Before any of them could get a second loan, they all had to repay the first. "It was a way of providing a little peer pressure, and it worked," says Holman. "More than 200 women have received loans and there has not been a single default. It has borne unbelievable fruit. Most of them are realizing profits of 300 to 400 percent on their loans."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Holman, retired for two seasons now, does most of the administrative work for the organization, which is based in Bellevue, Washington. Valle raises money and encourages other major-leaguers, like Seattle's Edgar Martinez, to join their cause. In the off-season, the 35-year-old Rangers catcher returns to the Caribbean nation to monitor Esperanza's work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I just believe that people as fortunate as us have to help," says Valle. "I just wish there was more I could do." Soon there might be. Valle's wife, Vickie, is Cuban; should the Castro regime tumble, Esperanza plans to set up a similar program there. "We'd like to help in the United States, too," Valle says, "but the problem is, $110 doesn't go very far here."<p><b>Mo Vaughn</b><br><a href="http://www.redsox.com/"><I>Boston Red Sox</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Boston educators will tell you that Mo Vaughn literally spends more time in the city's schools than some of the truants he's trying to reach. And his programs for inner-city kids go far beyond money and public-relations efforts. Vaughn, they say, has developed relationships with troubled teenagers, homeless mothers, terminally ill children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
"He has made a difference in the lives of many Boston youngsters," said Bob Elias, the director of Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Vaughn's parents were teachers and they instilled in their son two traits that linger still--a spirit of caring and an appreciation of education. The American League's Most Valuable Player in 1995, Vaughn is passionately involved in several education programs to help Boston's impoverished youth.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"These kids need to learn the value of an education," says Vaughn, a Seton Hall graduate. "Lots of times there is no one in their families who has been to college, maybe even no one who finished high school. They need to hear, in a personal-story kind of way, how it could change their lives."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Three years ago, he helped establish the Mo Vaughn Youth Development Program, an inner-city center where children gather safely for recreation and academic prepping. Volunteers tutor kids in classwork and in real-world work--they learn how to compose a resume, interview for a job, and open a bank account. "The main things we teach here are the value of education, self-esteem and learning a skill," says Roosevelt Smith, a program counselor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Baseball is my job," says Vaughn. "But my most satisfying day was the day we graduated eight kids to the next level in my program and I could see how it changed their lives. Some of these kids get a bad rap. They are facing tough situations every day and sometimes they don't make the right decisions. I try to spend time with them, to talk with them, because they want to know how life really works."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	ABCD director Elias says more kids are making the right decisions because of Vaughn. "He has had a definite influence for good. And the most impressive thing is that he wants to do more."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Vaughn, 28, also works closely with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, paying for equipment and activities and escorting groups to Red Sox games. He also is a visible spokesperson for the Greater Boston Food Bank and Catholic Charities. "Mo Vaughn," says Red Sox coach Frank White, "can't say no. He is just a great young man. Baseball needs more like him."<p><b>Jim Abbott</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/al/cal"><I>California Angels</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If you peeked into the bedroom of an American child born with a physical deformity, there's a good chance you'd find some reference to Jim Abbott--a signed photo, an autographed baseball, perhaps even a framed letter from the Angels pitcher.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Born without a right hand, Abbott pitched the U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in 1988, reached the major leagues a few years later and, in 1993, threw the first no-hitter by a New York Yankee in a decade. He is, in a way, the Jackie Robinson of handicapped athletes, a pioneer who changed his game and the perceptions of others.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"He has become an idol, an inspiration, a tremendous figure in the lives of these kids," says an Angels spokesman. "You wouldn't believe how much mail he receives from them. And he makes sure that every one of them gets some kind of response with a hopeful word."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Abbott works with numerous children's agencies, particularly Amigos de Los Ni&#241os (Friends of the Children), an organization that assists disabled, abused, and handicapped children. He frequently lectures, raises money, and signs autographs for the organization. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But that's just the tip of the iceberg: Disabled children constantly seek out Abbott, and if they can't get to him, he'll track them down. The pitcher once showed up at a game between two teams of disabled kids in an Orange County  (Calif.) Little League. He walked unannounced onto the field, shook each youngster's hand, talked with them, and then pitched an inning.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"The kids didn't come back to earth for weeks," says league president Kim Weingarten.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's also not unusual for Abbott to spot a disabled child in the crowd after a game and bring the youngster onto the field. Several of Abbott's game balls now reside in these children's trophy cases. But he has something more to offer them than an autograph or a baseball. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Someone has to convince these kids that they can accomplish whatever they want in life and their disability won't stop them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Like Johnny Appleseed, Abbott planted those seeds of hope and inspiration throughout Southern California in his first stint with the Angels. Now, after playing in New York and Chicago, he is back in Anaheim.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"When Jim was traded away it was like Orange County had lost one of its treasures," says Cindy Eigenhuis of Amigos de Los Ni&#241os. "He was so involved in activities for the kids. Now, thank God, he's back."
<p><b>Jeff Montgomery</b><br><a href="http://www.kcroyals.com/"><I>Kansas City Royals</I></a><br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Even the most devoted baseball fans admit that the game lacks the action and pizzazz of basketball, football, or hockey. For Jeff Montgomery, that's the point: He contends that the slow pace of baseball makes it an ideal setting for a father to interact with his son or daughter. The rhythm of baseball--with its foul balls, pitcher substitutions, pickoff throws to first base, and so on--creates a great climate for father-child quality time. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Montgomery thinks a lot about fathering--so much so that he has become an important spokesman for fatherhood in Kansas City. "All the evidence suggests that kids need some kind of fathering input in their lives," he says. "For me, as someone who has a lot of visibility, I think it's important to be out there identifying good fathers and informing young men about the joys and responsibilities of being a parent."The pitcher has joined with the National Center for Fathering, a nonprofit agency based in Kansas City that is aggressively promoting the virtues of fatherhood. And in a nation in which nearly 40 percent of all children under 18 live apart from their biological fathers, the cause of fathering needs all the relief help it can get.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Montgomery recently recruited his entire family to star in a public-service announcement for the center. He appears at NCF fund-raisers and has persuaded other Kansas City athletes to publicly support the cause of fathering. He is the prime force behind an NCF-sponsored essay contest, in which children are asked to explain why their fathers are important to them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're always looking for fathering advice," he says. "So I've been encouraging kids to write a brief essay on what their fathers mean to them. Some are not only touching and well written, but are of enormous benefit to the fathering center. They look at these essays and turn some of the messages into recommendations on how to be a successful father."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the four-year-old agency sought a prominent spokesperson for the virtues of fatherhood, Montgomery, it seemed, was recommended by everyone in Kansas City. "Jeff is extremely active in this community," says Peter Spokes, an NCF official, "and the work he has done for us has given our organization tremendous visibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Montgomery's life is indeed packed with charitable causes. The 34-year-old pitcher also helps the K.C. chapter of the American Heart Association, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the City Union Mission, the YMCA, and the Boys and Girls Club.<p>

	Montgomery was due to reveal the winner of the fatherhood essay contest on Father's Day, during a ceremony at the Royals' Kaufmann Stadium. The lucky youngster will walk to the mound, shake hands with the pitcher, read his or her essay over the microphone--"and, hopefully," says Montgomery, "every father at that game or watching on TV will go away a better parent having heard it."<p><b>Steve Finley</b><br><a href="http://www.padres.org/"><I>San Diego Padres</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Twenty-five teenagers from San Diego's worst neighborhoods stood nervously with 25 professional ballplayers on the first-base line at Jack Murphy Stadium. The players, all Padres, were there to help award the youngsters $5,000 academic scholarships. Center fielder Steve Finley stood there alongside Berenice Alcantara, a student at Palm Middle School.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Alcantara and her peers might never have gotten there without Finley's determination.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Shortly after a 1994 trade sent him from Houston to San Diego, Finley learned of the team's plan to start a scholarship program for impoverished, academically talented students. Though short of a tuition-waiver, the money could help put college within reach of needy kids. Great idea, he thought, but he had a suggestion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Both my parents were middle-school teachers back home" in Tennessee, says Finley, 31, the National League's Gold Glove center fielder last season. "They were loving with their students but they could be tough too. In fact, my dad, who was a principal, had a plaque on his desk that said, 'Attila the Hun.' But they always insisted that the time to reach out to kids, to get involved in their lives in a positive way, was when they were in middle-school."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Steve Finley remembered what "Attila" had told him. He convinced the Padres to aim the program at kids in middle-school, not high school, because "that's when kids are most susceptible to the lure of drugs and the streets," Finley says. "By high school, it might be too late. With a program like this, we'd be able to identify them as young teenagers and say, 'Hey, don't worry. You are going to college.' " <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Padres liked the idea and after much locker-room arm-twisting by Finley, the Padres Scholars program was launched. Finley guaranteed that he could raise $60,000, and the club said it would match the total. "You never saw anything like it," says Charles Steinberg, the Padres' director of community development. "There was Steve, carrying a yellow legal pad, walking slowly from locker to locker in the clubhouse, soliciting donations from his fellow players and convincing them of the worthiness of his cause."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Almost immediately he signed up Tony Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Brad Ausmus, and other Padres stars, as well as manager Bruce Bochy and his coaching staff. He was so convincing that many of his teammates soon became as active in the program as Finley. When San Diego traded pitcher Andy Benes to Seattle late last season, his final act as a Padre was to walk into the front office and write a check to the program for $10,000. And when Finley collected a bonus for winning the Gold Glove, he turned over a big chunk to the Scholars fund. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"This is something we should have been doing for a long time," says Finley. "Players and owners should be working together in their communities. And education is a common denominator."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Finley and Alcantara have grown as close as teammates through the Padres program. The ballplayer keeps an eye on her academic progress and is often the first one the teenager calls when she scores well on a test.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"This is definitely a two-way street," he says. "We're helping these kids, but we feel as if we're doing something for ourselves and the community, too. Sometimes as players, we get asked to help so many different causes that it's hard to see the benefits. But with this program, we sponsor individual kids and we see them. . . . We can see first-hand their progress and how this affects their lives."<p><b>Don Mattingly</b><br><a href="http://www.yankees.com/"><I>New York Yankees </I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Don Mattingly wants to play baseball again. And if, later this season, a team decides to call the 34-year-old former Yankee first baseman, he's easy to find: He has a couple of businesses to run.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A native of Evansville, Indiana, Mattingly operates two small businesses in his hometown. He lends his sweat, not just his name and money, to Mattingly's 23, a restaurant and sports-bar downtown, and Diamond Five Farm, his horse farm in the Indiana countryside. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	His roots in Evansville mean a lot of people are watching to see how well his businesses perform. And that means he must spend a lot of time not only building up his operations, but the network of locals who will help them to thrive.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
"I'm from Evansville," says Mattingly, speaking from his farm. "What happens here affects everyone who lives here and that includes me--especially since I'm not playing this year." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Mattingly opened the restaurant, named for his uniform number, a decade ago, and bought the horse farm in 1993. "He would be in the kitchen cooking something up, or in the office checking on some numbers," says Kevin Edmonds, the restaurant's general manager. "He even got involved in some of the hiring himself. He was a very hands-on owner." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The restaurant-bar, which can seat 350 and serves traditional American fare, employs about 40 people. Mattingly drifts in often, making sure people are getting seated, looking over the menu to see what's hot with customers, and checking on new employees. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There are a lot of players who, having made their fortune, will move to a sunny beach somewhere and build a wall around themselves," says Ray Shulte, the player's agent. "Some get involved in business, invest some money, let someone use their name and then wait for the checks. Not Don. He feels a responsibility to Evansville. And by being a successful businessman there, he is giving people work and giving something back."<p><b>Jeff Brantley</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/nl/cin"><I>Cincinnati Reds</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Jeff Brantley hails from Jackson, Mississippi. To grow up in a poor city in one of the nation's poorest states is to know something about poverty. Brantley watched how a welfare system helped to ensnare families in ramshackle neighborhoods, creating places where there were too many kids with too little to do.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Those kids had nothing," he says. "No opportunity. No hope."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Not even baseball. "Even if they wanted to play baseball, they had no equipment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So three years ago, Brantley, 32, decided to start a baseball league in Jackson's largely African-American west side. The Calvary Youth Baseball League began with eight teams and roughly 60 boys, ages 9 to 12. Today it has grown to 150 boys and 10 teams.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"He didn't just lend his name to that project," says Cal Wells, a close friend. "It was an eight-team league, a great project, and he got the whole thing together. He provided the money and the equipment. He got the ballpark and personally got involved in finding the coaches."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To Brantley, the coaches are crucial. They help set a tone, an attitude. "He wanted to make sure that the coaches were people of character, people the kids could look up to. He was as hands-on as you could possibly be, and yet he wanted his involvement kept real quiet," says Wells, a Jackson attorney.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For every good thing you know about Jeff Brantley, Wells says, there are 10 good things you don't know. One day last winter, the pitcher heard that a child dying of cancer had asked a shopping-mall Santa for a ball autographed by Jeff Brantley. "A few days before Christmas there was a knock at that family's door," Wells says. "There was Jeff, delivering the ball himself."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
 A religious man, Brantley said the combination of his Christian ideals and his professional good fortune compelled him to get involved in the lives of disadvantaged youngsters. "It's not so much a sense that, 'Well, I've done real well, I've got to help others,' " says Brantley. "I have a strong faith and I saw a need out there for kids to have some direction in their lives."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Mississippi State graduate got the idea for his hometown league early in his big-league career, when he was a Giants reliever. Brantley worked with a youth baseball league in a drug-plagued section of San Francisco. "There I just sponsored the team," he says. "But even at that level of involvement you could see the potential for good."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Brantley knew that to alter conditions in Jackson he needed to touch the parents as well as the children. League rules stipulate that the parents of players must attend a certain number of games and lend a hand in league activities. "The way I look at it," says Brantley, "the league is a little evangelism, a little baseball, a little fun."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And a lot of Jeff Brantley. <p><b>Craig Biggio</b><br><a href="http://www.astros.com/"><I>Houston Astros</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A Sunday afternoon game concludes at the Astrodome. Half-dressed Houston players linger at their lockers, talking with reporters or each other, picking at plates of postgame food, waiting for treatment in the trainer's room. Craig Biggio is dressed and heads for the door.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Told the kids I'd take them out for ice cream," explains the all-star second baseman.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Baseball separates families for most of the year and, more than other sports, confronts its players with constant temptations on lengthy road trips. "Anybody who thinks it's easy to maintain a normal family life in baseball is fooling themselves," says Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland. "Just look at the number of second and third marriages in the game. It requires real effort and commitment on everyone's part."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And, according to many in baseball, no one works harder at his family life than Biggio.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Like it or not, we are seen as role models by kids," Biggio says, "and if they can see an athlete they admire in a healthy family relationship, maybe it will have some sort of influence on their lives." So, while many ballplayers shelter their personal lives, he and his family--wife Pattie and sons Connor, three, and Cavan, one, make it a point to live much of theirs in public.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Biggio believes that a family is not unlike a baseball team. Its members function best when they function as a unit. So it's not unusual to see the Biggio clan at a black-tie charity affair--with high chair and baby nestled among the diners--or in the children's unit of a Houston hospital.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Biggio family's activities add a new meaning to the expression "family planning." "Craig's schedule is a very carefully orchestrated affair," says Gene Pemberton, the Astros' community-development director. "He leaves ample time for baseball, of course, but they make sure there is time for their causes."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"The all-American family is a clich," Pemberton says. "But in Craig's case it really applies. He and his wife and two kids do everything together. And he gets a lot of requests for his time, naturally, but he won't do anything without clearing it first with Pattie. A family man is what he's all about."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A pet project of the Biggio family these days is the Houston chapter of the Sunshine Kids, an organization that tries to fill the needs of terminally ill youngsters and their families. Whenever the Astros are at home, Biggio and his family visit sick children, either in local hospitals or in their homes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	You could say they belong to a sort of extended family--and no one's family is extended more than Biggio's. Which is just the way he wants it.<p><I>Frank Fitzpatrick is a sportswriter with the Philadelphia Inquirer.</I>

<blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
<b><font size="+2">W</font>illie Brown</b>, then the Speaker of the California Assembly, predicted in March 1995 that the <a href="http://www.publicaffairsweb.com/ccri">California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI)</a> would be defeated if it were given the "face . . . of a white woman." Opponents of the CCRI -- an amendment to the state constitution that would prohibit state and local governments from granting preferences or discriminating based on race, ethnicity, or sex--are taking Brown's advice. They're trying to define the initiative, on the ballot in November, as "anti-woman." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The <a href="http://www.now.org">National Organization for Women (NOW)</a> has made defeating the CCRI its top priority for 1996. Its leaders fear that a CCRI victory might herald the end of preferences in other states--and perhaps even nationwide. "A lot of the success or defeat of feminist issues will hinge on the fight against the CCRI," California NOW president Elizabeth Toledo told the <i>News for a People's World</i>. To show a unified feminist front against the CCRI, NOW chose San Francisco as the site of its annual rally in March.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Even previously nonpoliticized groups such as the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) have joined the opposition to the initiative. For 176 years, the YWCA has avoided involvement in political activity. But last December, the Los Angeles YWCA held a rally that featured preschoolers chanting "give girls a chance--girls are strong, too." At a press conference in San Diego sponsored by NOW and the YWCA, city councilman George Stevens called the CCRI "the most racist initiative that has ever been put on the ballot." Stevens called white males "the devil in the blue suit," claiming that white males are pushing the initiative as retribution against white women for being unwilling to serve their men at home. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Anti-CCRI activists cite arguments by law-school professors such as Erwin Chemerinsky (University of Southern California) and Laurie Levenson (Loyola) that the CCRI's Bona Fide Qualifications (BFQ) clause will lower the legal standards against sex-based discrimination. These assertions are absurd. The BFQ clause, taken directly from the 'bona fide occupational qualification" language of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, says, "Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as prohibiting bona fide qualifications based on sex which are reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education or public contracting." The clause exists to protect women, not to victimize them: It merely prohibits such things as the supervision by men of girls' locker rooms and strip searches of female prison inmates by male guards.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It is no mystery why sex is being emphasized. Preferences based on race are as unpopular in California as they are in the rest of the nation. From 1986 to 1994, the American National Election Studies biennial survey consistently measured the opposition to racial preferences at around 80 percent. Proponents of preferences find themselves in the position of having to defend the indefensible: the aggressive categorization of citizens in a democracy by race, ethnicity, and sex so as to give unearned benefits to some at the expense of others. So they are trying to scare women into thinking that the CCRI will lead to discrimination against them. But the strategy won't work. Polls by Charlton Research show no gender gap in the support for the CCRI, with 57 percent of both men and women supporting the initiative. There are four major reasons why women tend to support the California Civil Rights Initiative. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The first is that women, like men, believe in equality before the law. They believe that racial, ethnic, and gender preferences violate the fundamental principle of our political system: the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and the voting booth have come not by departing from America's founding creed, but by showing that America wasn't living up to its own political principles.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters. They are concerned about the unfair treatment of their sons, husbands, fathers, and brothers in the current system of group preferences. Responding to a pro-affirmative action editorial in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys whose husband recently lost his job, wrote, "I find 'affirmative action' and the like racist and sexist. . . . Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of 'unequal opportunity' toward our sons."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Third, women themselves are often treated unfairly by the current regime. For example, the University of California at Berkeley has had an official policy of giving preference in admissions to out-of-state minority students, even wealthy ones, over poor California residents of both sexes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Consider Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A resident of Los Angeles, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she managed to accumulate a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 (on a four-point scale), due to credit for advanced placement classes. Her combined SAT score was 1340 out of a possible 1600. In addition to working 15 hours a week, Lydia wracked up an impressive list of awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry and varsity letters in cross country, soccer, and track. She aspires to a career in engineering. She is exactly the candidate for which Berkeley claims to be looking: high-achieving, well rounded, poor, and a woman interested in science.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	None of this mattered. In March 1996, Lydia received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." There is little doubt that McDonald would have been admitted under a race-neutral system that placed an emphasis on academic achievement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Patricia Ribeiro worked for the Head Start program from 1962 to 1971. Five years ago, she applied for a teaching position in the Head Start program of the Long Beach Unified School District. When she asked why the district never acknowledged her application, Ribeiro was told by the programs coordinator, "Don't bother me about your application. I don't care how qualified you are, I am not going to hire you." When she asked why, she was told that the district had "enough white teachers already; you would not match the community you would be serving."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Preferences do benefit some women in public contracting. By statute, California must seek to award 5 percent of the nominal value of all state contracts to women. But no good data exists on how many women are actually in a position to benefit from these preferences. And proponents of preferences never explain how women would suffer under a gender-neutral system that awards contracts to the lowest bidder.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from gender preferences. A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of goal-based affirmative action. Women certainly have made tremendous progress in the work force in the last thirty years. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from race- and sex-based preference programs. Jonathan S. Leonard, an associate professor in Berkeley's School of Business, concluded in a 1989 journal article that "affirmative action has contributed negligibly to women's progress in the workplace." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	As Anita K. Blair, the executive vice president of the conservative Independent Women's Forum, recently wrote, the most important reason for this progress is that "women went to college." In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. Over the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees--M.B.A.s, M.D.s, and J.D.s--by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of preferences, but of changing cultural patterns and personal choices that enable women to excel in fields formerly dominated by men.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. In addition, women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1980, women owned approximately 2 million businesses with about $25 billion in sales. By 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned almost 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Just as organized feminists wrongly attribute women's success in the workplace to the protective hand of government, they also point to the glass ceiling and the alleged wage gap between the sexes as proof that preferences are still needed. The wage gap, however, is not so much proof of discrimination as a failure to account for statistical differences in age, education, and continuous years in the work force. June O'Neill, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, has found that childless women between the ages of 27 and 33 earn 98 percent as much as men with the same demographic characteristics.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The glass ceiling, too, is more the result of disparities in age, education, and career goals than the product of discrimination. Women who choose to invest in professional skills are doing well in our free economy. According to a recent study by Korn/Ferry International, from 1982 to 1992 the proportion of female executive vice presidents more than doubled, from 4 to 9 percent, and their share of senior vice president positions increased from 13 to 23 percent. This study also found that, on average, women were younger than the men surveyed and that women reached the $100,000 salary level earlier than men. Women don't need the protective and guiding hand of government. Just like men, they simply need opportunity. And equal opportunity for everyone is the driving principle of the CCRI.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The operative clause of the 10-sentence initiative reads, "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting." In other words, the CCRI aims to reinscribe in California's law the noble language and original purpose of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which has suffered three decades years of quiet subversion by unelected judges and bureaucrats.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It is no coincidence that the effort to roll back group preferences originated in California. Steeped in racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity, California urgently needs to dismantle the government's ethnic spoils system. If we are to create a truly vibrant community out of such diverse individuals, race and ethnicity must confer neither advantage nor disadvantage under the law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	This sentiment was expressed in Justice Harlan's ringing dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), in which he wrote, "The destinies of the two races in this country are indissolubly linked together . . . and the interests of both require that the common government of all shall not permit seeds of race hate to be planted under the sanction of law." Today, however, "grievance politics" threatens to destroy our understanding of a common national identity. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	At its core, the CCRI is a project of community-building, the first step in an effort to recover the animating principle of American citizenship, the Declaration's "self-evident truth" of human equality. This implies that all rights in America are vested in individuals, not groups. Thus, a woman's right to pursue happiness in America is secure, not because she is a woman, but because she is a person. A society in which individual rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial for women as it is for men. As such, the crusade to convince California women of their victimhood will fail. Expect the CCRI to pass in November with the strong support of women.<p><I>Sally C.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great's favorite field marshal and reputed lover, Grigori Potemkin, built phony villages one block deep throughout Russia's Black Sea provinces to give the tsarina a false sense of the region's prosperity. Two hundred years later, cynical denizens of Atlanta's poorest communities might wonder if the Olympic stadium and the surrounding Olympic village amount to a modern Potemkin village.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like any Olympic host, Atlanta is putting on its best face for its visitors. The Atlanta Committee for the <a href="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org">Olympic Games</a> is spending $1.7 billion and employing 99,000 workers to show the world the best of Atlanta and America. Indeed, the underwriting of Atlanta's expenses by home-grown corporate powerhouses such as Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola demonstrates one of Atlanta's greatest strengths: As one of America's entrepreneurial capitals, Atlanta is a thriving commercial center. A bastion of black enterprise, the city also boasts many distinguished universities and the world-champion Braves baseball franchise.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like most American metropolises, however, Atlanta also suffers from staggering urban blight. With 27 percent of its overall population, and 43 percent of its children, living in poverty, Atlanta rivals cities like Newark, New Jersey, as a center of decay and degradation. Forty-two percent of its households are headed by single women. Of America's 100 largest cities, Atlanta ranks second in its rate of violent crime.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the organizations charged with battling these social scourges have bungled. Take <a href="http://www.emory.edu/CARTER_CENTER/urban.htm">The Atlanta Project</a> (TAP), the multi-million-dollar nonprofit founded by Jimmy Carter four years ago to organize and stimulate 20 of Atlanta's most depressed communities. An internal audit of the organization's activities, released in January 1995, criticizes TAP for cultivating little input from the communities it serves, imposing cookie-cutter solutions from a bureaucratic central office, and focusing too much of its resources on small feel-good events like community clean-ups. TAP has faltered so badly that it recently eliminated all of its 89 full-time positions as part of a major restructuring effort. TAP's greatest achievement to date: consolidating application forms for social services from 64 pages to 8. All of this for $33.6 million.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If TAP typifies the flashy, top-down approach to community renewal, what follow are stories about the squads of private agencies engaged in a bareknuckled bout with poverty, homelessness, and crime. Unlike many nonprofits serving America's cities, these are not publicly funded extensions of government agencies. Nor do they receive the fanfare of an Olympic event. A tour of some of these ragtag, innovative organizations, each the product of dedicated citizenship, reveals what works in easing urban pathologies--one person, one family, one neighborhood at a time.<p><b>Victory for the Homeless</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Homelessness is one of Atlanta's most persistent social problems. Task Force for the Homeless, an Atlanta nonprofit that runs a hotline for the homeless, received requests for shelter from about 24,000 individuals last year alone--a thousand more than in the previous year and two thousand more than in 1993. "We need folks who come at the homeless problem from a tough-love approach," argues Russ Hardin, of the Atlanta-based Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation, which gave $3.9 million last year to organizations fighting homelessness.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They don't get much tougher than the church-based Victory House at 979 Boulevard SE, run by pastor Craig Soaries. Though it's the only shelter in Atlanta, according to Task Force, that admits people while they're still high--most of its residents are alcohol or drug abusers--they don't stay that way for more than an evening. The pastor's detoxification program is simple: Anyone who expects to receive Victory House's assistance must quit cold turkey.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The men's regimen has the feel of a boot-camp. Residents must wake by 7 a.m. and be at work by 9 a.m. Because ready cash is a quick ticket back to drug use, residents cannot work for money their first 30 days. Soaries gives them maintenance work on Victory House property and has them help with the shelter's fast-food, used-furniture, and used clothing businesses--all excellent incubators for learning job skills. After 30 days, those who are ready seek full-time employment while still at the shelter. They pay $50 in rent and place one-third of their salaries in a mandatory savings account. The men must observe a curfew, forswear smoking and cursing, and seek permission to leave the premises.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last year Victory House took in about five hundred men and provided fifteen hundred with food and clothing. It has helped 12,000 men since it opened in 1992. Hundreds are off the streets and in the workplace: According to an internal study, 75 percent of the men who participate hold down a job and stay drug- and alcohol-free at least six months to a year after leaving the three-month program.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soaries credits the program's spiritual content more than its regimen for its long-term success. Though men are not required to make a faith commitment to stay at the shelter, all must attend worship service Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. They must also participate in group prayer and counseling on Thursday and hold daily devotionals.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I do not apologize for who I am," says Soaries. "I have no other answer to addiction than the Scriptures."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ed Lindsey is 40 years old and had failed at drug rehabilitation three times before coming to Victory House. Says Lindsey, "Soaries was the first person to tell me that I didn't have a drug or alcohol problem but a problem with my inner spirit." Lindsey has been clean for eight months. To Soaries the message is clear: "Without a spiritual element, we would not be successful."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soaries' Bible-based approach to helping the homeless compels him to avoid most government funding. Most government contracts, for example, would prohibit his program from requiring attendance at worship services. As a result, Victory House gets 85 percent of its $152,000 budget from corporate and individual donors. The remainder comes from government contracts that do not infringe upon the spiritual content of the pastor's program--such as funds for certain capital expenditures.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A sign in front of Soaries's nondenominational church reads "Tired of Just Going to Church? Expect a Miracle Tonite!" Miracles seem to be happening in the inner lives of the residents of 979 Boulevard SE.<p><b>Four Walls and a Dream</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many advocates for the homeless insist that a lack of affordable housing is the principal cause of long-term homelessness. The success of groups like Victory House demonstrates that, for those literally "on the streets," drug and alcohol addiction is often the culprit. But there are many low-income families, living in cramped yet expensive apartments and run-down housing projects, who know first-hand how little decent, affordable housing there really is. For these people, homeownership is a dream out of reach.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just ask Constance Vining, a working divorced mother of six struggling to make ends meet. "I never thought I'd be a homeowner," Vining says. "I never thought I'd be able to scrape together a down payment."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She didn't have to. At 46, Vining has become the first member of her family ever to own a home. It wouldn't have happened without Charis Community Housing, a nonprofit urban-development program helping Atlanta's working poor (families earning $18,000 a year on average) become homeowners.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis helped Vining finance and build a new house in Atlanta's Summerhill neighborhood in exchange for an in-kind down payment: her "sweat equity" in helping to construct her own home. Now Vining pays $296 a month on a zero-interest loan for a one-story, three-bedroom, one-bathroom house. Previously, she had rented a run-down, two-bedroom apartment that cost her $550 a month and left her nothing to show for it. "Now I have something to leave my children. My dream has come true," she says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis is a subsidiary of a community-development corporation called FCS Urban Ministries, which coordinates the ideas and resources of local and suburban churches. (FCS stands for Family Consultation Services, although the organization is recognized only by its initials.) Charis has built 128 such homes since 1982. It is supported by three thousand volunteers, and 99 percent of its funds come from the private sector.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Candidates for Charis housing are put through a rigorous screening process. Charis reviews credit reports, scrutinizes character references, assesses current living conditions, and interviews candidate families--twice. It chooses only eight out of every 100 applicants. Those selected must participate in seminars on everything from home maintenance to budgeting, and receive financing deals similar to Vining's. In many ways, Charis follows the model of Habitat for Humanity, the low-income homebuilder based in Americus, Georgia. But there are a few interesting twists. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis builds houses in mixed-income bunches called "subdivisions." Only one-third of the homes built on Charis-bought property are targeted for the working poor. Charis volunteers and future homeowners build these homes. But Charis invites outside contractors to develop the rest of the property, building one-third of the remaining homes for lower middle-income families and one-third for middle-income families and above. "We don't want to recreate low-income neighborhoods," says executive director Nancy Flippin.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, Charis's commitment to its beneficiaries doesn't end when the last door is hung. "You don't change somebody's life just because you put them in a new house," says Flippin. Charis homeowners make a commitment to maintain their homes and are subject to surprise inspections and foreclosure if they don't keep their end of the bargain. Charis relies on an informal network of volunteers living in the communities it serves to help Charis beneficiaries tackle the challenges of homeownership and make sure Charis homeowners succeed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The overwhelming number do succeed. Program officials have had to foreclose on only five homes. "I was even happy to file a tax return when I could first file as a homeowner," laughs Vining. Charis homeowners in Summerhill once banded together to shut down a crack house. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Aretha Smith, a 36-year resident of Summerhill, sums up what homeowners like Vining mean to her neighborhood: "Most of them are working people over there. They're bringing the neighborhood back. Whatever they do, I just hope they keep building."<p><b>Alternative to Failing Schools</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As in many big cities, Atlanta's public-school system is costly, yet not terribly successful. It spends $6,495 per student--more than school districts in Detroit, Chicago, and Los Angeles--and its students on average score just 760 on the  combined SAT, below the 30th percentile on both the math and verbal sections.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirroring organizations in Indianapolis, San Antonio, Milwaukee, and other cities, the Children's Education Foundation (CEF) gave scholarships to 128 Atlanta school children this year to help them escape this system. CEF students now attend 45 private, mostly religiously affiliated schools and one suburban public school. Each scholarship covers half of a student's tuition up to $3,000; the average stipend is about $2,000.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CEF was founded with a $1-million grant from an anonymous private philanthropist, who has donated an additional $300,000 to cover the foundation's operating expenses and to ensure that his original investment goes directly to foundation scholarships. Families of four earning less than $28,000 per year and families of two earning less than $18,500 are eligible for scholarships, and students are awarded stipends on a first-come, first-served basis.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"My two oldest children were in public schools for two years and they had a very hard time," says Sandra Carter, a 16-year teaching veteran and mother of five, of her children's experience at Dodson Drive Elementary School. "My son was beaten up almost every day, and my daughter wasn't learning." Jason Grandison, a sixth-grader who attended West Clayton Elementary School, in College Park, recalls similar experiences. One boy even brought a gun to school. "I didn't learn much," says Jason, who had homework only one night a week and complains that his classes were too large for teachers to afford him much attention.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now Jason attends St. Anthony's Catholic School, in Atlanta's West End. Jason, who isn't Catholic, trots to school every day in his uniform--a yellow polo shirt and blue slacks. With class size averaging 15 students, Jason and his fellow students receive plenty of individual attention. He is kept busy after school with tutoring sessions and extracurricular activities--opportunities missing at his old school. There is no violence at St. Anthony's; rules are strictly enforced. And Jason gets homework every night. "Even Fridays," Jason says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Jason's grades are up, he is more engaged in school, and he has stayed out of trouble. CEF president Chuck Johnston reports that every recipient has improved his or her performance while on scholarship. None has ever had a scholarship terminated for poor grades or bad behavior.	But the attention, discipline, and academic training that students receive at CEF schools only partly explain these academic achievements. Scholarships normally cover only about half of a student's tuition costs because parental involvement is considered critical to the program's success. "We have found the success rate is considerably higher when the parent is making a sacrifice," Johnston says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Jason Grandison's mom, a single parent earning just $12,000 a year, has moved them into a single-bedroom apartment so they can afford Jason's $3,200 tuition. With that kind of love, it's hard to imagine that Jason will pass up his opportunity, or that his mother will let him.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Parents don't seem to mind. "Education is a partnership, which means parents must do their share," says parent Quinette Igherighe. And with that attitude, one man's philanthropy is becoming a winning investment. Says parent Gladys Porter, "For the future, in return for his money, he's going to get a lawyer, a teacher, and an engineer--my three kids."<p><b>Altruism for Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In any large city, hundreds of children drop out of school each year and get into trouble with the law. Metropolitan Atlanta's juvenile courts monitor 4,200 children on any given day through detention, probation, and counseling services. Most of these young offenders graduate neither from school nor from crime-ridden streets: Nearly 60 percent of them become repeat offenders, and 30 percent eventually move on to the adult court system.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clayton County's experience with juvenile offenders is typical of the metropolitan area. In 1995 alone, juvenile court there received about 3,400 youth offenders for misdemeanor and felony offenses. Clayton County probation officers are each responsible for as many as 250 juvenile offenders.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So when local karate instructor Debbie Swank approached the juvenile court, offering to work with young offenders, harried veteran probation officer Suzanne Igler recalls saying, "This is a waste of my time. Let me go back to my work." Now Igler volunteers for a private agency that Swank founded to help the county's youngest delinquents.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Swank founded Hearts to Nourish Hope, based 20 minutes southwest of downtown Atlanta, to provide troubled teens with unconditional love and a sense of family. A labor of money as well as love, Debbie started Hearts with funds from her karate school, American Tang Soo Do. Now Hearts takes in 60 to 75 juveniles on probation a month. The centerpiece of its program is a food pantry operated totally by the kids.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Working the pantry gives the teens valuable job training. They must report to work on time, maintain the facility (which doubles as Swank's karate studio), manage finances, take inventory, and solicit donations.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They also abide by a strict set of rules. Time earned toward their community-service requirements can be canceled if they shirk business responsibilities, disrespect their elders, wear gang clothing, or stir up mischief.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Anyone who has received food more than once is required to volunteer at Hearts. "We don't want to just give out food," says Amber, 15. "If you're trying, okay. But if you're just going to sit around, then you're not going to get our food."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the pantry is much more than just a job-training program for wayward youth. The experience transforms the children, many of whom come from broken families. "Sometimes I'll come here feeling gloomy and mad at someone or something," says "T," a 15-year-old who came to Hearts after committing five burglaries. "But when someone comes for a basket [of food], it makes you feel good to have helped somebody. " 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Hearts's success is best gauged by the number of teens who participate in the program but don't have to. More than one-third of the teens who perform their community service through Hearts come back after their time is up.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider Kristy Brown, who has been incarcerated six times. On January 31, she completed 95 days in prison for totaling an uninsured car while drunk. Since her release, she has remained clean, is working as an apprentice in a hair salon, and has just taken her GED exam. She attributes her recent victories to Hearts. "This place has made a real difference. Now I want to own my own hair salon and work with teens who have had problems like mine--to give them the help I've been given here."<p><b>Hammering Home Citizenship</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A consortium of construction firms is employing some of the entrepreneurial energy that has made Atlanta famous to build--literally--a better city.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A few years ago, FCS Urban Ministries wanted to convert GlenCastle, a three-story, 18th-century stockade, into affordable housing for the working poor. Atlanta's 11 largest building contractors--normally fierce competitors--collaborated on the project. They charged no overhead, no fees, and earned no profit. And they engaged in what project organizer Chris Humphreys half-jokingly calls "competitive begging": They convinced lumber yards, lighting stores, and other suppliers like Georgia Pacific, Home Depot, and Lithonia to donate materials or sell them to the contractors at cost. FCS trimmed its project expenses from an estimated $3.5 million to $2.5 million, a savings of nearly 30 percent.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now GlenCastle, with its three-foot-thick stone walls and an imposing watch tower, houses 125 people in 68 efficiency apartments. The residents include the mentally ill, the physically handicapped, recovering addicts, the elderly, and single-parent families.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"When we finished GlenCastle, no one expected it to keep going," says Humphreys. "But under their own initiative, the contractors got together and said, 'let's keep it up.' "	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In honor of its first project, the consortium calls itself GlenCastle Constructors, Inc. Over the last six years, it has built some of the most important nonprofit social-service ventures in Atlanta.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On land donated by Georgia Pacific, for example, they built Camp Twin Lakes--a 250-acre wooded summer oasis for kids suffering from chronic illnesses like cystic fibrosis, cancer, asthma, and kidney disease. They equipped the camp with a mini-hospital (including dialysis machines), and a wheelchair-accessible pool. GlenCastle delivered the project for $1.2 million less than it would have cost at market rates. Now about 2,000 children and 500 volunteers enjoy this privately operated and funded camp each summer. "Kids literally survive to get to their week at camp," says one camp counselor. "For some of them, it's the last fun thing they do."GlenCastle can finance its projects as cheaply as it does in part because it will not work for groups that receive government funds. If it did, federal law would mandate that it pay "prevailing union wages"--that is, above-market wages. Instead, union and nonunion workers labor side by side for the same wages. They also avoid mountains of paperwork. "We really don't do reporting," says Humphreys. "We don't want to explain how we bought paint when we got half of it for free."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These companies can also afford to divert their manpower and resources to GlenCastle projects because participation on a project by all 11 companies minimizes the burden incurred by any single company.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some still marvel to watch the city's leading construction firms collaborate on nonprofit projects. "I would have run over half these guys before the GlenCastle project," says Jimmy Humphries, the chairman of Humphries and Co. The 11 GlenCastle contractors beat each other up each day for 80 percent of the Atlanta construction market. But when it comes to helping the city's neediest, they have put their differences aside and their bulldozers together for nine major projects, with more planned.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list of Atlanta's successful nonprofits doesn't stop here. There is Birthright International, which persuades 85 percent of the two thousand women who visit its Atlanta office annually for free pregnancy tests to bring their children to term. There is also Genesis Shelter, which provides transitional housing to homeless families with newborns and teaches 60 percent of them to achieve independence once they leave.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of these agencies share three keys to success. First, they are dedicated. They have to be, because they operate on shoestring budgets and rely heavily on volunteers and the 80-hour work weeks their leaders put in. Second, they are demanding--of their beneficiaries as well as themselves. And third, they are independent. Unencumbered by the regulations that come with government social-service contracts, they are free to be innovative and flexible.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of Atlanta's nonprofit community, however, rejects these lessons of effective social outreach. The Open Door Community, a co-operative of Christians dedicated to serving the homeless, is philosophically opposed to helping the poor help themselves, says resident volunteer Todd Chioffi. With Task Force, it protests violations of "homeless rights," such as ordinances against aggressive pan handling and loitering; and it rallies for the city to install public urinals so that, as one man living in the Open Door Community sloganizes, the homeless can "pee for free with dignity."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Metropolitan Atlanta Community Foundation, which hands out $12 million a year to groups like Task Force, Atlanta Legal Aid, and Georgians for Choice, refuses to give money to faith-based charities because "no one has the right to tie social services to religion." Says executive director Alicia Philipp, "In my mind that's preying on people."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whatever their rationale, much of the city's corporate and foundation philanthropy remains disconnected from the real gold-medal winners of Atlanta's nonprofit sector. This gap is costly both in human terms and in spiritual terms: It allows social ills to persist and prevents needy Atlantans from sharing in the dreams of achievement the Olympics inspire. But should these nonprofits accept the torch that organizations like Victory House, Charis, and GlenCastle hold out for them, they will be able to tackle the truly Olympian task of building not a Potemkin village but an Atlanta of flourishing, vibrant communities.<p><I>Christopher Garcia is the assistant editor of</I> Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.<p></blockquote><P>Subscribe to <A HREF="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html"><i>Policy Review: The Journal of

<blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A story like this begins perhaps a thousand times every day: A woman's hand trembles as she scans the big-city Yellow Pages. The ads for abortion clinics have flowers and birds and slogans about caring, and one shows a pretty couple grinning at each other at the seashore. That makes her start crying again. Her boyfriend never looked at her like that.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But elsewhere on the page she sees an ad showing a woman curled around a baby. The phone number ends with the letters H-O-P-E. She hadn't thought about hope, but she feels like she really needs to talk to someone who has some, right now. She dials the number.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Half a year later, she is stepping out of the Hope Pregnancy Center. It's her first visit since the birth. Her little boy fusses while everyone hugs her. She stands for a moment in the spring sunshine. She's made it through these months after all. It's taken courage, and it's been tough, but this precious child has been brought through safely and given the gift of life. Without the love of the women at the center, this child would have died. She looks down at his wizened face. He is all she has now. Tears prick her eyes again, as she turns and walks to the bus stop.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What happens to mother and child next?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It horrifies me sometimes," says Pat Evans, the unpaid director of Birthright, a crisis-pregnancy center in Annapolis, Maryland. "She's on the list for public housing, but that housing is invariably in bad sections. But if she turns it down, she's off the list, or put back on at the bottom to wait all over again."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And how does she support herself? "She probably gets $225 a month on welfare, and there's food stamps, WIC [nutrition aid to women, infants, and children], and medical assistance," says Evans, who has counseled thousands of women in her 16 years there. "In all these years, I've seen less than a half-dozen find a way to work. Once they have that baby, how can they find a job that pays enough to buy a car to get to the job, and cover day care as well?" Evans's center, which assists about 1,200 women a year, can help some with housing for a year after the birth, but can't offer permanent housing or employment. "I don't see any answer to that; it's almost impossible. When she has a child, everything gets very hard."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's 3,000 pregnancy centers have been rescuing women and their unborn children for 30 years now. When we list the nonbureaucratic, grass-roots organizations that are doing the most to save threatened lives, pregnancy centers must rank near the top.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These privately funded, storefront operations offer women material and emotional support free of charge, and they help hundreds of thousands each year to have their babies. Perhaps more than any other institution, these centers are shaping attitudes about abortion and the unborn--one person at a time--in a decidedly pro-life direction. While conservatives debate the wisdom of a pro-life agenda for the 1996 presidential campaign, tens of thousands of volunteers are quietly keeping a candle glowing through the darkest night of many women's lives.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the old joke, a grandmother peevishly greets the exhausted hero who has just rescued her grandson from a frozen lake: "But where are his mittens?" The pregnancy centers and their staff endure difficult, lifesaving work, little or no pay, and obscurity occasionally alleviated by insult. It hardly seems right for those of us who value these centers' hard work to punctuate our praise with grumbling about lost mittens. But the recent evolution in society's attitudes toward welfare compel a closer look.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For all the good crisis-pregnancy centers do, 80 to 90 percent of their clients--about 200,000 a year--eventually set up single-parent households. Most of these mothers and their children soon find themselves on their own, with no reliable means of financial support. Many end up permanently dependent on government welfare. Some even slip into homelessness. And we all know the eventual outcomes for many of the children born into such households: poverty, low academic achievement, susceptibility to crime. If pregnancy-counseling centers are to serve the best long-term interests of children, many of them will need to think beyond pregnancy and birth--to finding each one a two-parent home.<p><b>A Welfare World View</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To Evans and others like her, welfare is a necessity. Without it, the young women they serve would grow even more desolate and desperate. "We do put people on welfare," says Evans. "We do create the single-parent homes, but at least the baby is alive. Someone has to help us if this is going to change. As it is, the volunteers are doing it all themselves--counseling, giving supplies, taking women to live in their homes."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But it is important to acknowledge that welfare causes more crisis pregnancies. By making single-parent households possible, welfare dollars remove the stigma of sex and pregnancy outside marriage. Girls who grow up without a father are more than twice as likely to have a baby out of wedlock themselves.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time for the pregnancy-care movement to broaden its vision of how best to help unwed mothers. Such a change has already begun in the last six years or so. The movement once focused narrowly on saving unborn babies; now it emphasizes giving the mother practical support so she can save her own child.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The movement's next step is to seek the best possible future for both mother and child. Too often, the crisis mentality of the moment envisions only two possibilities: The woman will have an abortion, or she'll "keep the baby," usually as a single mom. In reality, there are two other options that merit pro-lifers' support.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A poll conducted by <a href="http://www.frc.org/">Family Research Council</a> in 1995 asked respondents which course they thought would be best for an unwed, pregnant teen. Twenty-nine percent thought her best choice was to place the child for adoption. Slightly fewer, 24 percent, felt she should marry the father of the child. Eleven percent thought single-parenting was her best course. Only 8 percent recommended abortion.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Reality turns these numbers upside down. In 1991, 46 percent of pregnancies to unwed mothers ended in abortion. Most of the rest, 44 percent, were carried to term. (Miscarriages make up the difference.) Of those births to unwed moms, only 2 percent were placed for adoption; the remainder of the unwed moms kept their babies. How many of those also married the babies' dads is unknown; pregnancy-care workers reckon the figure is quite low.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the pregnancy-care movement could find effective ways to encourage women to choose <a href="http://www.infi.net/adopt/">adoption</a>, they could help give children a two-parent home and offer both the children and their moms greater security. By thinking beyond merely "saving that baby" or getting the woman through pregnancy, counselors can help bolster the social institutions that undergird a healthy society and replace welfare bureaucracy with family-based alternatives.<p><b>Talking about Adoption</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Most two-parent homes are created by marriage, and a few pregnancy centers encourage their clients to consider this option. But in general, pregnancy centers seem better equipped to incorporate the adoption option into their work. June Ring, the coordinator of adoption resources for Presbyterians Pro-life, is one of a handful of pro-lifers who are charting such a course. She has devised a seminar, "Adoption: Making a Plan for Life," to train the center's staff to present adoption as an attractive alternative. The counselors' first duty is to raise the topic in the first place. "One study found that in 40 percent of counseling situations, adoption was not even mentioned to the client as an option," Ring says, "even though the majority of counselors felt favorably toward adoption." She proposes that pregnancy-care workers resolve to mention adoption to every single client. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to the National Council for Adoption, a 1991 study found that pregnant, unmarried teens who were counseled in a program that mentioned adoption to every client were seven times more likely to choose it. When the teen's parents were involved in counseling, they were six times more likely to choose adoption. Teens asked to compare adoption with single parenting were also six times more likely to choose adoption.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But pregnancy centers are cautious about how they discuss this option. Some women who placed their infants for adoption have subsequently sued the centers where they had received counseling, saying they had felt coerced. In Florida, state authorities warned a pregnancy center that volunteers could not discuss adoption with clients, since the center was not a licensed adoption agency. A federal court later declared this "gag rule" unconstitutional.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Incidents like these tend to scare off cash-poor pregnancy centers. They may use a "reality therapy" approach, helping clients compare the tough life of a single parent with that of a mom who chooses adoption, but they won't state that adoption is better. "We don't coerce, convince, or make the decisions, but we do give complete, objective, and accurate information," Ring says. "We want the client to consider adoption equally and in as much depth as other options."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One problem many centers confront is the one-visit client. A woman comes in for a free pregnancy test, gets a positive result, and leaves, never to be seen again. Even then, Ring says, the center can "plant an adoption seed" by mentioning that alternative. "Emphasize her motherhood," says Ring. A positive result on the pregnancy test means she's already the mother of an unborn child. What does she think goes into being a good parent? Might those be things an adoptive couple could do for her child? "Help her see that planning an adoption can accomplish those parenting goals for her."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ring's cool phrasing about helping the woman "accomplish parenting goals" avoids a trap that ensnares some unwitting pregnancy workers. When counselors see only two alternatives, aborting the child or giving it life, they may try to tip the scale toward life by awakening the maternal instinct. As the woman falls in love with her unborn baby, the center may shower her with baby gifts, give her a handmade quilt or blanket, and introduce her to previous clients who are now cuddling beautiful babies. Once her maternal emotions are ignited, the mom might not be able to let her child go. (The 1991 study cited above found that pregnant teens counseled in programs that introduced them to teen parents were four times less likely to choose adoption.) 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Counselors must strike a delicate balance: Encourage mothers-to-be to love their babies enough to give them life, yet still be willing to place them with two-parent homes. To some women, planning for adoption smacks of abandoning the child and of being a bad mother.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anne Pierson, of a group called Loving and Caring, is also trying to increase awareness of adoption. Pierson, who offers training to pregnancy centers and maternity homes, has incorporated Ring's materials into her "A Future and a Hope" seminar. "The pregnant woman needs to see that she's giving the child the gift of a family," Pierson says, "not that she's giving the adoptive couple the gift of a child. She is being a very good parent by making a good plan for the child."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While counselors target the client, Pierson targets the counselors. Those who have had children may harbor an unconscious bias against adoption, she says, because many cannot understand how another mom could "give up" her own child. "We find that one reason counselors are ineffective in presenting adoption is that it's not settled in their own hearts," says Pierson. "They don't understand what it means to be an adopted child of God; they don't understand Scripture." Pierson believes that a better understanding of the biblical teaching about adoption--how it suggests God's unconditional acceptance of people into his spiritual family--can help counselors present it more effectively.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Counselors need practical advice as well, and Loving and Caring is setting up seminars to deliver it. "We work with them on key issues: how to bring it up, how to talk about it, the experience of grieving, the mom's experience of learning new things about herself," says Pierson. "The journey of adoption, the entire process, is as important as the decision itself." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the LIGHT House maternity home in Kansas City, Missouri, 10 percent of the clients--well above the national average--choose adoption. One reason is that the home strips away myths about motherhood, adoption, and abortion. "We don't push one decision or another, but we do help them make an informed decision," says Shirley Gibson, the director of residential services and adoption. "We want them to have a realistic view of being a single parent--not only the financial but the emotional cost." Residents talk frankly about the good and bad sides of any decision, including the grief they may feel after an adoption placement. But it's hard not to be starry-eyed over the prospect of cuddling a sweet baby.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of a pink cherub, however, clients get to hold "Baby Jamie"--an electronic infant that records such things as how long the girl takes to respond when it cries, how long to feed it, and whether it's being abused. Girls who think they'd like to parent can take a turn with Baby Jamie. They must carry a diaper bag and get up in the night for "feedings," while keeping to their regular school schedule.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another reason for the high adoption rate at LIGHT House is its emphasis on reaching abortion-minded women. "Women who are considering abortion are more open to adoption," says Gibson. "Some people don't mind being pregnant. All they want is free medical care. Our primary goal is alternatives to abortion." If the woman is considering abortion because she doesn't want to raise a baby, adoption can accomplish her goal as well.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to individual counseling, women contemplating adoption participate in an intensive, 20-week adoption class. The course covers everything from legal issues like the birth father's rights to preparing for birth, handling grief, and deciding whether to write a letter to the child that the adoptive parents can put aside for later. (The LIGHT House does not encourage ongoing contact between the birth mother and the adoptive family.) "The scariest part is these feelings you're having," Gibson says. "You think you're the only one having them. It's reassuring to learn that [all] birth mothers feel the same way. After the birth, if you feel like changing your mind, that might be an intellectual decision--or it might be an emotional decision. We ask them to think: Are the reasons you initially decided for adoption still valid?" 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most pregnancy counselors agree that adoption needs to become more visible. Mariam Bell, a would-be adoptive mom in Annandale, Virginia, spends many Saturday mornings with friends setting up a table outside a nearby abortion clinic. The table is covered with a gingham cloth, and stocked with coffee and doughnuts; helium balloons and signs reading "Choose Adoption" and "We Care About You" complete the scene. If cars pause on the way in, Bell hands the passengers a packet containing information about adoption and profiles of prospective adoptive couples. Many passengers stop to talk, then leave without entering the clinic. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Many girls are crying as they're being driven in," Bell says. "They're not joyfully exercising some right to privacy; they are in trauma. Seeing that was very important in reinforcing my belief that this is the approach we need to take." An approach, that is, that demonstrates pro-lifers can stand outside an abortion clinic doing something peaceful, positive, and ultimately hopeful.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among society's most pressing problems is the seemingly endless supply of pregnancies to unwed mothers. Pregnancy centers have 30 years' experience in offering mothers the personal support and encouragement needed to make a life-affirming choice. But once born, that baby deserves a better life than welfare and single-parenting can offer. Pregnancy centers, which have already done so much to better the prospects of women and children, need to expand their vision one more time. They should do far more to encourage mothers to consider adoption. This is less a criticism of pregnancy centers' valiant work than a discovery. It turns out that we've found the mittens after all. We just need to put them to use.<p><I>Frederica Mathewes-Green is a syndicated columnist and the author of</I> Real Choices: Offering Practical, Life-Affirming Alternatives to Abortion<I> (Questar, 1994).</I>

<h2>How Business Delivers the Good</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
<blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	By anyone's definition, Jerome Lemelson is a great philanthropist. Lemelson has donated tens of millions of dollars over the years to organizations ranging from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to local charities across the country. He has devoted much of his philanthropy to extolling the virtues of technological innovation. He has given millions of dollars to universities and the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C., to create programs to teach and promote invention. The first annual Lemelson--MIT Prize (a $500,000 "Nobel" of sorts for American inventors) was awarded in 1995. At his death, his foundation is expected to be worth at least $300 million.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By honoring invention, Lemelson's philanthropy merely reflects his life's work. Jerome Lemelson holds more patents than any living person. Since 1949, when he created a typewriter eraser as an undergraduate project at New York University, Lemelson has patented some five hundred inventions, from video telephones, audiocassette players, and videocassette recorders to spark plugs, ice skates, and Silly Putty. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; We associate inventors with gadgets and "gee whiz" discoveries to such an extent that we often forget how important their innovations are to daily life. No matter how hard Lemelson tries, the value of his charitable work could not possibly match the value of his contributions to American society as an innovator and entrepreneur. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Take just one of his inventions, an automated system for reading bar-code labels. Without this seemingly modest technology, which Lemelson helped pioneer, much of modern industry simply would not exist. Manufacturers such as automakers and computer companies rely on bar codes to track the flow of parts in factories and the movement of finished goods in the distribution chain. Most Americans encounter bar codes every day in retail stores, where their use speeds up checkout lines and reduces errors.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Such information helps firms adjust production and distribution to the changing desires of consumers. This commonplace technology supplies new retailers with daily information about consumer demand and inventories, allowing them to cut prices, increase product offerings, and serve customers better. Wal-Mart, Toys 'R' Us, Blockbuster, and Home Depot all owe part of their success to the revolutionary impact of bar-code readers. Measuring the value that the bar code has added to the economy would be virtually impossible, but it must be billions of dollars, at least. Lemelson's praiseworthy philanthropic activities pale by comparison.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lemelson understands the social value of entrepreneurship. "Innovation and invention have helped build the greatest industrial economy the world has ever known," he once told Entrepreneur magazine. "But inventors have always been left on their own. My goal is to make Americans more conscious of innovation." Meanwhile, however, the debate over the responsibility of business to society will continue to focus on noncommercial activities deemed socially beneficial, rather than on what firms actually make and sell. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; So Vermont-based Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream is regarded by many as the prototype of a "socially responsible" corporation because it gives away 7.5 percent of its profits to charity (the average for U.S. corporations is a little over 1 percent), limits the salaries of its top executives, and conspicuously supports social causes. Yet its main enterprise is making and selling premium ice cream, a luxury good (unlike rice or shoes or electric power) that, one could say, harms the health of many Americans by filling their bellies with fat and sugar. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even, it should be noted, to employ people. Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic mission--such as their employment practices, their participation in community or cultural life, or their waste management--distracts us from the benefits that businesses confer on society. To satisfy the ever-changing needs of consumers, successful firms must constantly invent new products, new services, new ways of doing business more efficiently. This they do better than other social institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of governmental or charitable action.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, journalists and politicians thrive on bad news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring and compensation practices. Yet business innovation historically has helped liberate American women. Technological advances have promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more freedom to pursue education and employment.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Similarly, automation and computers have improved workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and devise solutions to systemic problems. More generally, it now takes fewer employees to manufacture goods in America--and that means fewer chances for injuries, illnesses, and accidental deaths as more workers move into services.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Advocates of "corporate social responsibility" spend a lot of time talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to consumers. They can applaud Ben & Jerry's or the Body Shop as exemplars of responsibility, because ice cream and cosmetics do little "damage to the ecosystem." On the other hand, they rarely save lives, alleviate pain, or feed the hungry.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being nonbiodegradable and polluting. Yet plastic is the essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Even where activists concentrate their attention--such as the relationship between employers and employees--they get the story wrong. They allege that in the absence of government regulation or a sense of responsibility beyond the profit motive, companies will inevitably mistreat their workers. But in most American workplaces today, employers are constantly mindful of the well-being of employees. If workers are not competent, healthy, and motivated, businesses will fail.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Social-responsibility analysts usually employ flawed measurements of responsibility. They gauge the fairness of employment decisions by whether a firm's work force reflects the racial and gender composition of the surrounding community, not by whether the firm actually discriminates unfairly. They measure responsibility towards families by the number of workers covered by company health insurance, or by the presence of on-site day care. But in many cases, such benefits are not worth as much to an employee as are higher wages, flexible benefits plans that allow workers to choose the nonwage compensation most valuable to them, or the freedom to work part time rather than full time.<p><b>Doing Well, Doing Good</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	On a more fundamental level, social-responsibility activists barely understand how the search for economic return on investment can motivate companies to "do good." When downsizing, for example, it is almost always in the interest of companies to treat their workers with respect and to help them find new jobs. For one thing, layoffs affect not only workers being let go, but also those who remain. Retained employees watch how their former coworkers are treated and wonder what will happen to their own livelihood.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Poorly handled layoffs can cripple employee morale and so hurt productivity. After the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, AT&T was forced to reduce its work force by more than 100,000 employees. To head off morale problems, the company created a "safe landing" program to help laid-off workers find other jobs.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Also, firms can save money in severance payments by getting their former workers re-employed. One study by Washington State University professor Duane E. Leigh found that job-search assistance was an effective tool for re-employing people, because it "allows for quick intervention before workers disperse after layoffs and plant closings; and, given their modest cost per worker, the evidence suggests that [job-search] services are cost-effective" by reducing severance and unemployment insurance costs. Health One Corp. discovered this after deciding to close Metropolitan-Mount Sinai Medical Center, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Instead of just handing pink slips to 1,200 employees, the company found jobs for 90 percent of them. Health One actually saved more in unemployment and severance expenses than the $500,000 it spent on job training and placement.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The corporate social-responsibility movement harbors an unrealistic, ahistorical view of commercial activity. Critics of corporations zero in on the Exxon Valdez oil spill or the Bhopal chemical-plant disaster because they are well known. All too often, we take for granted what goes right and dwell on disasters and villains--which are notable precisely because they are exceptional. The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely recognized.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In our search for heroes, we lionize political leaders or military commanders or make-believe TV characters. Yet the real heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and overcome the fundamental problems of humanity. It's a pity that, with few exceptions, those who create the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity.

<b>Michael Reagan Surfs the Web</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Watch out, Al Gore. Popular conservative radio commentator <b>Michael Reagan</b> has joined the information superhighway. Brought on-line on October 1, 1995, the <b>Reagan Information Exchange</b> web site has since drawn 265,000 Internet visitors. The site's offerings range from the serious to the comical: from "Hot Topics," a politically frank discussion of current events, to "Liberal Man," a comic strip about the adventures of a liberal superhero. Web surfers will also find quotes from Reagan's father, the former president, and an opportunity to share thoughts with Reagan. "It's a way to bypass the traditional media and to get the information from Mike's show in the hands of the people without the spin of the liberal media," says Andy Beal, the president of MediaFax Technology, who manages the site. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those of you who don't share Reagan's enthusiasm for technology could tune into his radio show, broadcast by nearly two hundred radio stations across the country between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST. Of particular note is Reagan's Constitutional Minute. Part history lesson, part hard-hitting commentary, it examines how lawmakers can distort the principles of the Constitution to escape its constraints.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While the major networks draw fire for their vulgar entertainment programming, a small network is tackling profound issues at the heart of good citizenship. <b>National Empowerment Television's Political NewsTalk Network</b> offers television programs focused on limited government and personal responsibility, the cornerstones of a free society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Launched in December 1993, NET broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week and reaches 12 million households. Programs include "The Right Side," with social commentary by columnist Armstrong Williams; "Straight Talk," a show on the politics of the family hosted by Family Research Council's Gary Bauer; "BorderLine," which features live discussions about immigration, language, culture, assimilation, population, and the environment; and "Legal Notebook," which showcases live debates about court rulings, court opinions, and judicial appointments.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>Americans for Tax Reform</b> has declared July 3 <b>Cost of Government Day (COGD)</b>--the day of the calendar year on which the average American worker has earned enough in gross income to pay off all of his or her government-imposed financial obligations. These obligations include federal, state, and local taxes; federal regulatory costs; and state workers' compensation and tort-law costs. They do not include state regulatory costs, which are substantial but difficult to quantify. Still, by year's end, the average American will have spent 184.6 days--more than half of the year--in essence working for the government. COGD arrives one day earlier than last year in part because 1996 is a leap year. In recent years, the day has fallen as late as July 11, but defense cuts have offset continued growth in social and discretionary spending. Republicans have also reined in the growth of some spending programs.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	February 29 was the occasion for the launch of the <b>Center for New Black Leadership,</b> a D.C.-based think tank devoted to promoting "a market-oriented, community-based vision of public leadership for black communities in America." It supports policies consistent with the black community's long-held commitment to individual initiative and personal and civic responsibility. The center sponsors debates, symposia, and conferences; publishes essays, papers, and op-eds; files amicus briefs in important appellate court cases; offers testimony before Congress; and holds media roundtable discussions. Run by president Brian W. Jones, the center is guided by a distinguished board of directors that includes Minnesota banking executive Peter Bell, Arianna Huffington of the <a href="http://cec.pff.org">Center for Effective Compassion</a>, Shelby Steele of the <a href="http://hoover.stanford.edu">Hoover Institution</a>, Phyllis Berry Meyers of the National Center for Leadership Training and Recruitment, and Glenn Loury of Boston University. To date, the Center has filed an amicus brief in support of school choice in Milwaukee, commissioned a scholarly analysis of Clarence Thomas's jurisprudence, offered testimony to the U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee regarding federal contract set-asides for minority contractors, and commissioned a review of polling data on the black community's attitudes on important social and political issues.<p>

<a name="what"><h2>WHAT WORKS</h2><P> <b>Businesses BID to Improve NYC</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All across America, businesses are pooling their resources to pick up where city government is leaving off. Nationally, there are approximately a thousand Business Improvement Districts (BIDs)--local business zones whose corporations tax themselves to pay for cleaning and patrolling surrounding city streets and to provide services to the homeless. Unencumbered by bureaucratic rules and procedures or inefficient labor contracts, many have blazed trails in solving social problems.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With 34 already in place and 39 to come, New York City has a greater number of BIDs than any other city in the country. The most famous is the Grand Central Partnership (GCP), which covers a 50-block section of midtown Manhattan and represents 14 percent of Manhattan's total office space. In <I>City Journal,</I> <b>Heather Mac Donald</b> holds up this district and others in New York to demonstrate that BIDs work. The improvement of midtown Manhattan is palpable. Since it started in 1988, GCP has reduced crime in its jurisdiction 60 percent; graffiti has disappeared; new lampposts, planters, and trash receptacles have been installed. GCP is doing a better job battling urban blight than the government ever could. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, BIDs have their critics: business "experts" and academicians who complain that additional taxes will drive businesses from cities, social-service professionals whose jobs are threatened by successful BIDs, liberals who object to private action in public spaces, and redistributionists who fear that BIDs contribute to growing disparity between the rich and the poor. But Mac Donald notes that the Partnership's 24-hour social service center has helped move the area's homeless into jobs and off drugs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>"BIDs Really Work," by Heather Mac Donald, City Journal, Spring 1996.</I><p><b>Welfare Reform</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In "Welfare Reform in the States," a two-part series published in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/crc"><b>Capital Research Center</b></a>'s Alternatives in Philanthropy newsletter, leaders of 17 state public-policy think tanks examine state-level welfare reform and propose new ideas for transferring responsibility for welfare services to charities and nonprofit organizations. Lawrence W. Reed, president of the Michigan-based <b>Mackinac Center for Public Policy,</b> demonstrates how Governor John Engler has revolutionized welfare in Michigan by requiring welfare recipients to work in exchange for benefits and allowing welfare beneficiaries to keep their earnings without receiving a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their welfare benefits. David G. Tuerck of Massachusett's <b>Beacon Hill Institute</b> wants to encourage private charity by giving taxpayers a 100 percent federal tax credit for contributions to private charities--up to 25 percent of their total federal tax liability.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tom Tancredo and Dwight Filley of the Colorado-based <b>Independence Institute</b> believe welfare reform is a key weapon in the battle against fatherlessness. Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post of California's <b>Pacific Research Institute</b> support a welfare-reform initiative in their state that would reduce benefit levels and eliminate welfare increases for households in which there is any increase in the number of adults or children but underscore the importance of delivering social services privately by highlighting two successful California nonprofits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Joseph Bast of the Illinois-based <a href="http://www.heartland.org"><b>Heartland Institute</b></a> criticizes reforms in his state for "throwing good money after bad, and reshuffling bureaucracies." Peter Barwick of the Pennsylvania-based <a href="http://www.oneworld.org/com_fnd"><b>Commonwealth Foundation</b></a> defends work requirements against three criticisms, including the argument that they undermine family.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amy Frantz of the <b>Public Interest Institute</b> in Iowa backs Individual Development Accounts--IRAs for low-income people that are managed by and can receive matching funds from community organizations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Kelly McCutchen of the <b>Georgia Public Policy Foundation</b> writes that welfare reform as conservatives understand it receives overwhelming support from Georgians--across race lines.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Writing for the <b>Nevada Policy Research Institute,</b> state senator Maurice E. Washington describes three faith-based organizations that are helping the needy in his state achieve self-sufficiency.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Gary Palmer of the <b>Alabama Family Alliance</b> highlights a privately funded Christian elementary school that charges no tuition and breaks the welfare dependency cycle by giving its children an outstanding academic and moral education. And John Hood, president of the North Carolina-based John Locke Foundation wants to reform the largest of all welfare programs, Medicaid, by issuing vouchers to low-income people to purchase private health insurance, enroll in managed care, or make deposits to medical savings accounts.	<p>

<b>Property-Rights Reversals</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Average Americans oppose legislation that protects their property from uncompensated takings by the government. This is exactly what land-rights activists discovered in Washington state when a statewide referendum on property rights in the fall of 1995 went down to defeat by a 3-2 margin.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ed Carson explains in <a href="http://www.deltanet.com/reason"><b>Reason</b></a> how this counterintuitive vote happened and teases out lessons for land-rights activists. The 1994 Republican revolution created a tremendous opportunity for property-rights activists in the state legislature. The result: Initiative 164, which requires the state to compensate property owners when land-use regulations diminish the use and value of their property, passed into law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Opponents quickly gathered signatures to put the initiative on the last year's November ballot as a popular referendum. The referendum on preserving the property-rights law as is failed by a resounding 3-2 margin, primarily because property-rights activists failed to sell the proposal to urban and suburban voters. Having spent so many years as a minority lobby in a minority party, the referendum's supporters hadn't developed a way to relate the effects of uncompensated takings (higher housing prices and limited job opportunities) to the lives of all Washingtonians.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Opponents capitalized on widespread distrust of Republicans--even by Republicans--on environmental issues. They also argued persuasively that suburban taxes would rise to pay for new bureaucracy. Finally, the referendum was vague and poorly written. Carson concludes that land-rights activists will be successful pushing their agenda only if they pull suburbanites on board.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>"Property Frights," by Ed Carson, </I>Reason,<I> May 1996.</I><p><b>Older Men, Pregnant Teens</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welfare reform correctly targets teen pregnancy as a cause of welfare dependency, Kathleen Sylvester of the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org"><b>Progressive Policy Institute</b></a> reports. Forty-three percent of long-term AFDC recipients were 17 or younger when they gave birth the first time. But welfare reformers only attack half of the teen pregnancy problem when they attempt to reform young female behavior. Seventy percent of babies born to teen moms are fathered by men 20 years or older. At worst, these children are the product of child abuse or molestation; at the very least, they are the result of statutory rape--what many states now call "unlawful sexual intercourse." If we want to combat teen pregnancy, Sylvester argues, we need to punish these predators.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stiffening penalties for child abuse and unlawful intercourse is not enough--many states have already done so to no avail. The real problem: Child molesters and statutory rapists are prosecuted less frequently than other sex offenders. Prosecutors fear that teens are unreliable witnesses. And when they are prosecuted, these offenders rarely receive the stiffest penalties under the law.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The importance of punishing men who prey on teens is underscored by the generational cost of failure. Studies show that even teens who consent to sex with older men often do so because they were once sexually abused and search for the stability an older man symbolically affords. But children born to women who have been subject to sexual abuse are often abused themselves. Failure to address this problem now will contribute not only to welfare dependency but to the continuation of child abuse as well.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>"Punish the Predators," by Kathleen Sylvester, New Democrat, May/June 1996.</I><p><a name="thoughts"><H2>THOUGHTS ON CIVIL SOCIETY</H2><p><b>Marriage</b>		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The May/June "issue of <b>American Enterprise</b> is devoted to the premise, as editor Karl Zinsmeister puts it in his introductory essay, that, "Marriage is the cornerstone upon which most of the rest of our social order rests." Once this cornerstone begins to crumble, all of our remaining social institutions are bound to become shaky, too. "That's why marriage reclamation must precede other forms of societal reform," he writes.		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One reason so many marriages are in trouble, argues film critic Michael Medved, is an ubiquitous but pernicious custom that "not only misleads individual couples, but also serves to undermine the best foundation for stable marriage in this society." This custom is known as the honeymoon. 		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"A union that emphasizes at its outset the shallow and fleeting pleasures of a few days in the sun," Medved argues, "cannot have the staying power of a partnership of common purpose, supported by similarly committed friends and family." Medved contrasts the modern honeymoon with the Jewish tradition of Sheva Berachos, and with the 19th-century marriages between pioneers celebrated in the Aaron Copland-Martha Graham ballet, Appalachian Spring. In both cases, rather than escaping to some exotic locale, the newlyweds are joyfully inducted into the community in which they intend to make their lives. "Instead of thoughtlessly accepting the idea that newlyweds need to be cut off from company, we all have a stake in promoting wedding traditions that connect couples to their communities," Medved concludes.		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another reason marriage is in trouble, argues sociologist Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, is that prominent feminist thinkers no longer believe that it is important. She quotes feminist Katha Pollitt, who contends that "[i]f single women can have sex, their own homes, the respect of friends, and interesting work, they don't need to tell themselves that any marriage is better than none. Why not have a child on one's own? Children are a joy. Many men are not."		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But it turns out, Whitehead argues, that the big losers in any society that devalues marriage are women. "A society of more informal and easily dissoluble intimate unions, " she writes, "is a society where there is likely to be more male aggression against women--for crimes of violence against women are rooted mostly in male jealousy." The O.J. Simpson case was only "the most sensational" in a series of recent celebrity trials for battery and rape. As the American marriage takes on the characteristics of the American job--"short-term, contingent, subject to abrupt termination"--the occasions of "sexual rivalry, brinkmanship, and violence" are bound to increase, and the perennial war between the sexes will take on "a more aggressive, openly vengeful, and even violent edge."		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because churches and synagogues conduct three-quarters of all marriage ceremonies in the United States, they have a special obligation to help couples accomplish two goals, argues nationally syndicated columnist Michael McManus: "First, avoid a bad marriage before it begins. Second, learn to resolve conflicts that are inevitable." 		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some churches and synagogues are rising to the challenge. Marriage Encounter, a lay movement that came out of Catholicism and now involves a dozen denominations, conducts weekend retreats led by couples with fulfilling marriages. Designed to help marriages that are under stress, Marriage Encounter has enjoyed phenomenal success. "Studies show that 80 to 90 percent" of the couples attending their weekend retreats "literally fall back in love."		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To counsel engaged couples, David Olson, a family psychologist at the University of Minnesota, developed a "premarital inventory" called PREPARE. Consisting of 125 statements that the engaged man and woman are both asked to accept or dispute, PREPARE is easily administered by a pastor or mentoring couple. "Remarkably," writes McManus, "PREPARE predicts with 86 percent accuracy which couples will divorce, and with 80 percent accuracy who will have a good marriage. More importantly, 10 to 15 percent of those who take the test break off their engagements . . . avoiding a bad marriage before it begins."		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given these results, McManus concludes that any church can significantly reduce its members' divorce rate, provided that it thinks of itself as a marriage-saving institution rather than simply a "wedding factory." "Our churches need to involve themselves in preparing couples for life-long marriage, in strengthening existing marriages, and in saving unions headed for the rocks." 		<p>

<a name="sidebar"><h2>PRIVATIZATION COMPETITION AWARDS</h2>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>The Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy (PRI),</b> based in San Francisco, is a think tank that offers less costly, more efficient government with market-oriented solutions. On May 7, PRI hosted its fourth annual Privatization Competition Awards Dinner, honoring citizens and private organizations who have developed successful alternatives to government-managed social services in California. The nominees were judged by William D. Eggers of the Reason Foundation, Arianna Huffington of the Center for Effective Compassion, and Eloise Anderson, the director of California's Department of Social Services. A description of this year's five winners:		<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Chrysalis</b> helps the homeless in Los Angeles find jobs by teaching job-hunting skills, offering assistance in writing resumes, videotaping mock interviews, teaching typing and word processing, and providing its clients with bus fare and work clothes for job interviews. Chrysalis places some individuals in need of job experience or temporary employment with a street maintenance company or employs them through its own temp agency. Since 1984, it has helped three thousand homeless (63 percent of the people it has served) find and retain jobs for at least 90 days. Chrysalis is 80 percent privately funded.			<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Redwood Gospel Mission</b> on average serves 6,116 hot meals and provides 2,256 beds to the needy and homeless of Sonoma County each month. The Mission also provides food and clothes, prepares the homeless for job searches, and treats drug and alcohol addictions. It accepts no government money. 			<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Challengers Boys & Girls Club</b> is an after-school program that provides at-risk Los Angeles youth ages 6 to 17 with an alternative to crime and delinquency through education, leadership projects, physical education, and social activities. Challengers requires parent participation. It receives less than 20 percent of its budget from government sources.			<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Center for Black Concerns</b> is a think tank that has assembled a resource bank ofeducators, social workers, counselors, psychologists, and parole officers to address the needs and concerns of black people. Through Project Pride, the Center mentors minority students in danger of not completing school. The Center also operates a drug-free housing program for adult substance abusers. The Center does not receive any government funding.			<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>4-H After-School Program</b> provides 1,200 children in public housing with after-school activities at 23 sites throughout Los Angeles. Participants receive tutoring and participate in community service projects. Fifty-five percent of 4-H's budget comes from the private sector.		<p>

	Wendelyn Martz has lived on both sides of the mommy wars. An urban planner in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, she had always intended to pursue her career. She took a leave of three months after the birth of her son; five weeks after her daughter was born, she raced back to work to finish a high-profile project. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Slowly she began to burn out. Her husband was working long hours, so all the duties at home landed upon her shoulders. Something had to give. "I thought, 'This is not right. I'm cheating someone and I'm probably cheating everyone,' " she says. "I needed to be home." Finally she resigned. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nevertheless, she loved her work and wanted to continue her professional interests. "I need work outside of my family," she says. "My whole world cannot be successfully reduced to just taking care of my children. I'm trying to find that middle ground." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A few years ago, Martz and a partner started a home-based business designing and marketing greeting cards. Sales took off, her husband began providing his marketing expertise, and today her Pathway Art can be found in every corner of the country, from the Borders Books chain to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C. Her son, age six, even helps assemble orders and offers editorial comment on new designs. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Martz's story is becoming increasingly familiar. A growing number of career women are leaving established companies to start their own. Aided by the tools of the Information Revolution--computers, modems, and fax machine--many women with young children are becoming entrepreneurs by establishing home-based businesses. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, U.S. women own 3.5 million home-based businesses. Additionally, they provide full-time or part-time employment for an estimated 14 million people. Martz and her peers are joining an impressive group: Mrs. Field's Cookies, Est&#233e Lauder Cosmetics, Lane Bryant, Stairmaster, even Steinway pianos, all started as home-based businesses. Kim Hackett, the executive director of the Women's Home Business Network, says that information and computer-based businesses such as desktop publishing, graphic design, free-lance writing, and consulting are among the most successful such businesses. But women are finding that their skills as lawyers, accountants, real-estate agents, and public-relations professionals also translate well to businesses based at home. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's driving this wave of women entrepreneurs? For the first time in our history, the majority of babies less than a year old have mothers in the paid work force. In fact, the fastest-growing segment of mothers in the work force are precisely the ones with the greatest child-care responsibilities--those with children under six years of age. Since 1960, these mothers have <i>tripled</i> their work force participation. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The efforts of women to juggle babies and briefcases exact a stiff price: A recent issue of <i>Parents</i> magazine concluded that, among mothers, "emotional conflict is epidemic." In a startling reader survey of 18,000 women, the magazine discovered that only 4 percent of respondents would choose full-time employment if they could do "whatever they wished." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What do women really want? Most want flexibility: 61 percent of the women said they would choose part-time work if they could. Similarly, a 1995 poll of 3,000 women done by Roper Starch found that 43 percent of employed women with children would prefer to stay home. Another poll found that 87 percent of women want to spend more time caring for their children. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, the discussion of women and workplace issues in the women's movement and in the public-policy realm remains focused on the "glass ceiling." Women call for flexibility in employment and more time with their children while the public debate centers on day care. Even the Republican-dominated National Governors' Association favors more federal spending on day care. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the real working woman appears to be voting with her feet. According to <i>Fortune</i> magazine, "The generation of women that blazed new trails into the corporate suites is, evidently, blazing its own trails out." In 1995, <i>Fortune</i> surveyed three hundred executive women and found that 87 percent said they had made or were considering making a major change in their lives. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Home-grown entrepreneurship offers many women a way to honor their commitment to family while pursuing professional challenges. This entrepreneurial spirit has allowed some women to regain control of their lives; home-based work supplies the flexibility missing in the formal workplace. Technology and the economic dynamism of the 21st century will make home businesses a more attractive option for millions of American women.<p><b>The Taxman Cometh</b> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Public policy threatens to stifle the vigor and creativity of the small home-based entrepreneur. "Consider the tax code," says Dianne Floyd Sutton, of the National Association for the Self-Employed. "It stands like King Canute, commanding the waves of modernization to recede." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a> greets the home-based worker with downright hostility and discrimination. Start with the home-office deduction. At the first national conference on home-based business, in 1994, an IRS representative commented in a workshop that "everyone who took a home-office deduction in 1993 is red-flagged for an audit." Here's the problem: To deduct the expenses of a home office, tax expert J.K. Lasser explains, you "must be able to prove that you use the home area exclusively and on a regular basis" for one of two reasons--either as a place of business to meet with customers in the normal course of your business, or as your "principal place of business." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The IRS interpretation of this law has been exceptionally stringent. Lasser points out that one woman who ran a roadside stand selling home-prepared items a mile from her home was not allowed to deduct her home-office expenses, because the IRS ruled that the stand was her principal place of business. In a similar case, a challenge to that interpretation reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1993, the Court  ruled that a deduction is not allowable when the home office is used only for administrative purposes and not for seeing customers. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This ruling hits women especially hard. In a hearing before the Small Business Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Beverley Williams, the president of the <a href="http://www.aahbb.org">American Association of Home-Based Businesses</a>, testified that not allowing deductions for business owners who conduct business outside their home offices raises a safety issue. "Many women choose . . . to not receive their clients who are strangers into their homes," Williams said. "They should not be asked to compromise their safety or perception of safety for the sake of business deductions that other small businesses enjoy." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other legal minutiae can bog down home-grown businesses:<ul><p><li>The "exclusive use" clause raises a hurdle for people caring for dependents, such as mothers with young children. An IRS auditor who found a diaper-changing table in a home office, for example, might disallow the deduction.<p><li>Home-based businesses are caught between local zoning laws and IRS rules. Zoning laws sometimes preclude home-based business owners from meeting clients in their offices, thereby jeopardizing their deductions. But business owners who rent offices outside their home have no difficulty deducting these office expenses, even if they, too, always meet clients elsewhere. What justifies the disparity?<p><li>IRS rules are murky in defining when a home-based business can claim "independent contractor" status. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~nickles/">Don Nickles</a> of Oklahoma laments, "This distinction is determined by an arbitrary 20-part Internal Revenue Service common-law test. This inconsistent method has been the bane of small business owners who often face bankrupting penalties and taxation despite good-faith efforts to properly classify employees for tax purposes."	<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last seven years, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines. Nickles and Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/bond.html">Christopher Bond</a> of Missouri have introduced the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1610:">Independent Contractor Simplification Act</a> of 1996 to reform tax rules in favor of home businesses. Representative <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Republican from Nebraska, has introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1972:">similar bill</a> in the House, collecting more than 200 cosponsors.<p><li>Health-insurance costs are only partially deductible for home businesses. Author Paul Edwards, an expert in home-based businesses, points out that corporations may deduct 100 percent of health-care costs for their employees. Moreover, the health-care benefits are not counted as taxable income for the employees. But home-based firms can deduct only 30 percent of their health-care costs. President Clinton recently signed a bill increasing this deduction by 5 percent a year--but the increase will top out at 50 percent, maintaining the bias against home-based businesses.</ul><p><b>Resources </b> <P>

Second, it helps if your customers, clients, and colleagues know when they can regularly reach you. (And third: some people will need to limit their work.)<p>2. Hire a baby sitter. Main benefit to being home: being with your kids. Big obstacle to productivity: being with your kids. It can be done without a baby sitter and, after all, the point is to see them more than you would working away from home. But most people should plan to use some kind of baby-sitting. A home-based career offers lots of creative opportunities: Some moms have arranged baby-sitting co-ops in their communities. Many churches have pre-school or "mom's mornings out" programs.<p>3. Be professional. There's nothing like trading the perks of an office and an expense account for baby spit-up and dirty dishes to undermine a professional attitude. And our society sends not-so-subtle messages that moms and home are not cutting edge. Don't buy it. A professional image is critical and begins with inner confidence. Authors Paul and Sarah Edwards say that "being taken seriously" is the one of biggest challenges for home-based workers. The antidote is careful professionalism.<p>4. Network, network, network. Other challenges for the home-based worker are marketing, becoming out-of-touch, and personal isolation. These are disparate problems; the answer to all three is the same: use networking to help identify your home-based business or job . . . and then don't stop. Keep in touch with former colleagues. Drop notes. Do lunch. One mother who downshifted her career began giving dinner parties to maintain contacts; she's still in the loop and in demand.<p>5. Measure twice, cut once. One size does not fit all when it comes to work/family arrangements. Home-based businesses are not for everyone: it's wise to "count the cost" before beginning. Run with your talents, and recognize your limit
ations; if you are a people person who needs structure, a home-based situation might not be for you. And, although professions such as desktop publishing are suited to home-based operations, others are not.<p>It is tempting to whitewash the sacrifices involved in switching gears in your career, but there are no easy answers to the work/family dilemma. Facing that reality squarely raises your chances of success by allowing you to focus on the rich rewards of working at home, rather than on the opportunities left behind.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In recent years, the debate over gun policy has been dominated by two federal initiatives: the Brady bill's waiting period for the purchase of handguns and the ban on so-called assault weapons. While these federal issues have riveted the nation's attention, however, a quiet revolution in gun policy has spread throughout the states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten years ago, only a half-dozen states routinely issued permits for trained citizens to carry concealed handguns for personal protection. Most states gave police departments wide latitude to issue such permits, which were rarely given to persons other than retired police officers and people with political connections. Today, however, 30 states comprising half the nation's population grant concealed-carry permits to law-abiding citizens. In the long run, this movement will be far more significant than either the Brady waiting period (which expires in 1998) or the ban on certain semiautomatics (which expires in 2004).	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This movement began in the early 1980s, when gun-rights activists in Florida joined with law-enforcement lobbies such as the Florida Chiefs of Police Association to reform the state's handgun law. They proposed legislation that entitled any citizen who clears a fingerprint-based background check and passes gun-safety classes to receive a permit to carry a concealed handgun for protection.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the legislature passed the concealed-carry bill several times, it was vetoed repeatedly by Democratic governor Bob Graham. But his successor, Republican governor Bob Martinez, signed the bill in 1987. Since then, a steady progression of states has adopted concealed-carry laws modeled on Florida's, and more are likely to follow.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whenever a state legislature first considers a concealed-carry bill, opponents typically warn of horrible consequences: Permit holders will slaughter each other in traffic disputes, while would-be Rambos shoot bystanders in incompetent attempts to thwart crime. But within a year of passage, the issue usually drops off the news media's radar screen, while gun-control advocates in the legislature conclude that the law wasn't so bad after all.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In some respects, the concealed-carry movement has become a women's issue. In fact, about a quarter of those who apply for and receive carry permits are women. When Alaska governor Walter Hickel signed concealed-carry legislation in 1993, he explained that the constituents he found most compelling were "the women who called and said they worked late and had to cross dark parking lots, and why couldn't they carry a concealed gun?"	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading <a href="http://www.moa.sonnet.com/nvrpc/index.html">advocates</a> for concealed-carry laws include female victims of crime such as Suzanna Gratia Hupp, whose parents were murdered five years ago in a mass killing in Killeen, Texas; Rebecca John Wyatt, the founder of <a href="http://web.wn.net/~usr/chris/web/swarm.html">Safety for Women and Responsible Motherhood</a>; and Marion Hammer, the new president of the <a href="http://www.nra.org">National Rifle Association</a> and an activist in the Florida concealed-carry debate. Hammer once brandished her handgun to ward off a gang of would-be robbers.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Has this movement toward concealed-carry laws made America safer or more dangerous? In an article for the Tennessee Law Review, historian Clayton Cramer and I examined homicide rates in states that had adopted concealed-carry laws, adjusted for the effects of national homicide trends. In all but one state we examined, homicide rates did not appear to change as a result of the laws. We saw fluctuations, of course, but nothing out of the ordinary.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The lone exception was Florida, where the murder rate started an immediate, steady decline. Before the law, Floridians were about 36 percent more likely to be murdered than other Americans; after a few years, the Florida rate was equal to or slightly less than the national rate. As for other violent crimes, Florida was the worst state in the nation both before and after the new law. Florida's overall violent-crime rate, however, rose much more slowly since 1987 than did the national violent-crime rate.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We also examined violent-crime data in California, where permit policies vary widely by county. Counties that issue permits liberally had lower violent-crime rates than counties with restrictive policies; restrictive counties had lower rates than counties with prohibitive policies. A graduate student at Southwest Texas State University compared states that adopted concealed-carry laws with demographically similar states that did not. This study found strong support for the hypothesis that concealed-carry laws reduce the homicide rate, and weak (but still positive) support for a reduction in robbery and serious assault.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Advocates of gun-control advocates sometimes cite a 1995 study of concealed-carry policies by three researchers from the University of Maryland. The study looked at five urban areas and found that in four of them, the handgun homicide rate rose after a concealed-carry law had been enacted. But David McDowall, one of the authors, says that the small set of data limits the conclusions to be drawn from the study. He also states that there is no evidence permit holders commit crimes. The study is a classic illustration of how changing the parameters of a "before-and-after" analysis can change the results. For each city, McDowall and his colleagues averaged the yearly crime rates from 1973 until the year before the law went into effect, and compared that figure to the average rate of all subsequent years. If, instead, we compare the year before the law went into effect with the most recent year for which we have complete data (1994), then the homicide rate declined in three of the five cities.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of the research about concealed- carry laws has been eclipsed by a comprehensive study by University of Chicago law professor John Lott, with graduate student David Mustard. Examining crime data for 3,054 counties, Lott and Mustard found that while concealed-carry reform had little effect in rural counties, in urban counties reform was followed by a substantial reduction in homicide and other violent crimes such as robbery. At the same time, there was a statistically significant rise in nonconfrontational property crimes, such as larceny and car theft. Apparently many criminals concluded that the risks of encountering a victim who could fight back had become too high.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Lott and Mustard estimated that if all states that did not have concealed carry laws in 1992 adopted such laws, there would be approximately 1,800 fewer murders and 3,000 fewer rapes annually. Thus the adoption or improvement of concealed carry laws in more than a dozen states since 1992 may be one of several causes for the current decline in murder rates.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, data alone cannot measure the benefits of concealed-carry reform. If a gun permit helps a woman feel safe enough to go jogging, her increased sense of security is an important social benefit--even if she never has to draw a gun. If she does encounter a criminal, the chances are small that she will actually have to fire, and less than 1 percent that he will take the gun away. In the most thorough study ever done on this subject, Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck found that most instances of a citizen drawing a gun in self-defense end with the assailant simply retreating.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although solid proof of the effect of concealed-carry laws in reducing violent crime is relatively recent, it has long been clear that they do not threaten public safety. The most detailed information we have about the behavior of such permit holders comes from Dade County, Florida.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Florida's law went into effect, Miami's police chief ordered his officers to compile detailed reports of all police encounters with permit holders. In Miami, the number of permits increased from 1,200 in September 1987 to 21,092 in August 1992, when the police department decided that the behavior of permit holders did not merit further study. In five years, permit holders were convicted in these instances of criminal misuse of a firearm: two cases of aggravated assault involving a firearm, one case of armed trespass, and one case of a motorist shooting at another driver. In addition, one permit holder unthinkingly attempted to enter the secure area at Miami's airport with a firearm in her purse, and another accidentally shot himself in the leg. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Dade County police also recorded the following incidents involving defensive use of licensed concealed firearms: two robbery cases in which the permit holder produced a firearm and the robbers fled; two cases involving permit holders who intervened to attempt to stop a robbery, but the robbers were not apprehended (and no one else was hurt); one robbery victim whose gun was seized by the robber; a man who shot a pit bull that was attacking him; two cases of a citizen capturing a burglar; three cases of a burglar who was frightened off but not captured; one case of thwarted rape; and a bail bondsman who fired two shots at a fleeing bail-jumper wanted for armed robbery. There were no reports of permit holders shooting innocent people by accident.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Florida as a whole, 315,000 permits had been issued by December 31, 1995. Only five had been revoked because the permit holder committed a violent crime with a gun. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Permit holders are not angels, but they are an unusually law-abiding collection of citizens. In Florida, for example, permit holders are about 300 times less likely to perpetrate a gun crime than Floridians without permits. Florida's experience has been copied nationwide. This should not be at all surprising: A person could carry a concealed handgun without a permit and, unless he gives himself away by committing some other offense, he would never be caught. Hence permit applicants tend to be those citizens willing to pay a large fee (usually more than $100) to comply with a law they could probably break with impunity.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although 1 to 4 percent of the adult population exercises the freedom to carry a handgun for protection, a much larger group believes they should have such a choice. Polls usually show that one-half to two-thirds of the population supports concealed-carry laws. Higher rates are reported when respondents are informed about the various restrictions--such as training requirements--typically included in concealed-carry laws. These laws appeal to citizens who object neither to gun ownership nor to the use of force in self-defense, yet welcome moderate regulation to screen out undesirables.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Similarly, law-enforcement organizations in many states have supported concealed-carry laws. In Colorado, 53 of the state's 63 sheriffs voluntarily issue carry permits to citizens who pass a background check--even in liberal Boulder County. As these peace officers recognize, the government cannot in practice guarantee the safety of citizens in their daily lives. Therefore government must not prevent a responsible, trained individual from seeking to protect herself. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The concealed-carry movement is based on the principle that responsible citizens should not expect government to provide them with the essentials of life. Providing for the safety of one's self and one's family is first of all a personal duty.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, everyone is a potential beneficiary of concealed-carry reform. Since criminals do not know which of their potential victims may be armed, even persons without carry permits would enjoy increased safety from any deterrent effect. Moreover, a Psychology Today study of "good Samaritans" who came to the aid of violent-crime victims found that 81 percent were gun owners, and many of them carried guns in their cars or on their persons.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concealed-carry reform is no panacea for the high rates of crime in this nation, but it will be an important component of an anticrime strategy based on the right and duty of good citizens to take responsibility for public safety.

<b><a name="citizen">Citizen Initiatives Fertilize the Grass Roots</a><br>
By Lawrence W. Reed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There may be no better barometer of citizen involvement in politics than ballot initiatives, and this year's bountiful crop suggests that activism at the state level is surging. Grass-roots conservative activists are not waiting for the Republican Congress to take up their causes. From school choice to tax cuts to affirmative action, ballot issues backed by conservatives seem to outnumber liberal causes for the first time in recent elections.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Initiatives reach state ballots after aroused citizens surmount an obstacle course of petition requirements, filing deadlines, and occasional court or legislative challenges. Designed to amend state constitutions or enact statutory law, they allow disaffected voters in the 24 states that permit them to vent their frustrations and allow activists to force reforms past unwilling legislators.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1981 through 1992, according to the Council of State Governments, 346 initiatives appeared on state ballots--more than in the previous 40 years. Eighty-eight more were put before voters in 1994. By early May of this year, 26 initiatives had qualified for the ballot of November 5, 1996, while petitions were still circulating on behalf of about 300 others. In the end, only a small fraction will actually make it onto the ballot. This year's proposals tackle some of the most contentious issues in American politics:	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Affirmative action. Kolt Z. Jones, an expert on initiatives at <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform,</a> says that all points of the spectrum are represented by this year's initiatives. Liberals back measures to raise minimum wages in several states and to limit campaign spending; conservatives are pushing term limits, supermajority requirements for tax hikes, charter schools, and school vouchers. But "the mother of them all," he says, is the <a href="http://www.publicaffairsweb.com/ccri/">California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI).</a> 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CCRI would ban the state from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to any individual on the basis of race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, public education, or public contracting. It would effectively end affirmative action in California state government. Passage of the initiative, says Brian T. Kennedy of the <a href="/claremont">Claremont Institute's</a> Sacramento office, "would be more than a first step in rolling back affirmative action across America, it would be a giant leap in that direction." Similar initiatives to prohibit racial discrimination are circulating in Florida, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington, but the fate of CCRI  could decide the course of the movement to roll back racial and gender preferences.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although polls have consistently shown strong support for the initiative, millions of dollars in attack ads may narrow the margin between now and November. Still, a strong antiquotas measure on the ballot cannot be good for Bill Clinton. Says Katherine Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco, "The California Civil Rights Initiative poses a big problem for the president, who has hedged on the issue of preference programs with a 'mend, don't end' policy. California is critical to the Clinton re-election strategy and if the president comes out on the popular side of the issue, he would alienate core constituencies of his own party everywhere." (For more information, contact the Claremont Institute at 909-621-6825, or the Pacific Research Institute at 415-989-0833. Also, see <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/pipes.html">"Smart Women, Foolish Quotas,"</a> by Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch, page 30.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Political reform. Two of the four initiatives that have qualified for the California ballot so far would cap contributions to political campaigns. The one backed by Common Cause would put stiff limits on personal contributions to local and state campaigns. Observers think the limits are so low that they would virtually end TV campaign ads in California. The other measure, pushed by Naderite groups, contains similar restrictions with a loophole that would permit unions to get around the limits.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the conservative side of political reform, the term-limits juggernaut has put initiatives on the ballot in Wyoming and Maine, while other measures still need signatures to qualify in Alaska, Florida, and Nevada. At least 22 states have already enacted term limits for state and/or federal officeholders, all but one through citizen initiatives. (For more information, contact Citizens for Term Limits at 703-421-8635 or <a href="http://www.termlimits.org/ustl.shtml">U.S. Term Limits</a> at 202-393-6440.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum wage. The drive in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.15 an hour parallels a similar effort at the state level. Most economists agree that no legislature can make a person worth a certain amount by making it illegal to pay him less. One suspects that organized labor is more interested in attracting Democratic voters to the polls than in helping the downtrodden worker. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An initiative to raise the statewide minimum wage in California may qualify for the ballot. This proposal would hike the minimum wage to $5 in 1997 and to $5.75 a year later. The main sponsor, not surprisingly, is the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a>. A ballot measure in the District of Columbia, if approved, would raise the minimum to $6.75 over three years. A similar initiative in Oregon would boost the state's minimum wage from $4.75 to $6.50.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The preamble to the Oregon initiative touts the measure this way: "[T]o increase economic independence, to reduce the need for public benefits, to enable families to raise their children in dignity, to increase meaningful employment, to increase the purchasing power of low-income citizens, and thereby expand the tax base, Oregon law is revised to create a more livable minimum wage." Says Steve Buckstein of the <a href="http://www.cascadepolicy.org">Cascade Policy Institute</a> in Portland, "Makes you wonder why they didn't raise the minimum to $20 or even $50 per hour. The workers' paradise is just one election away!" (For information about these initiatives, contact the Cascade Policy Institute at 503-242-0900.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Tax reform and property rights. This year activists are pushing dozens of initiatives to limit or abolish taxes. Nevadans and Floridians will vote on whether to require a two-thirds "supermajority" vote in the legislature to raise taxes, and similar proposals are circulating in Arizona and Ohio. Proposed initiatives in Arkansas, California, Florida, Michigan, and Missouri would require voter approval, in some cases by a supermajority, of tax increases. Petitions to reform or eliminate property taxes are circulating in at least 10 states.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Florida may get a chance to vote on a measure that requires government to compensate property owners for state actions that harm property values. (For more information, contact Americans for Tax Reform at 202-785-0266.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;School choice. The country's hottest school-choice debate is likely to be in Washington state, where voters will face two initiatives that have riled the teacher unions. Jim and Fawn Spady, citizen reformers whose frustration with the public schools finally pushed them into political action, can take most of the credit for getting a charter-school proposal on the ballot. It would allow parents, teachers, or anyone else to organize an independent, deregulated, and publicly funded school, bypassing the local public-school bureaucracy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ron Taber, a candidate for state superintendent of schools, led the effort to put a voucher plan before voters. His plan would give parents a voucher worth $3,400 for each school-age child that parents could use at any public or private school with space available.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies, in Seattle, is optimistic about the proposals. "For the first time in memory," he says, "the people of our state are fed up enough with the WEA [Washington Education Association] to pass one or both of these initiatives. If that happens, we'll break the monopoly grip of both the WEA and the Olympia bureaucracy on our children's education." Petitions to put school-choice measures on the ballot are circulating in Arkansas, Arizona, California, and Florida. (For information, call the Washington Institute for Policy Studies at 206-938-6300.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Parental rights. Colorado voters may be the first in the country to vote on a so-called parental-rights amendment, a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing that "the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children shall not be infringed" by government action. This proposal is part of a movement, backed by the advocacy group Of the People, to counter unwanted government interference in such areas as sex education. (For more information, contact Of the People at 703-351-5051.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Direct democracy. Initiatives themselves are under attack in Colorado, where voters will decide the fate of a referendum initiated in the legislature. It would stipulate that the state constitution could be amended only by a supermajority of 60 percent of the voters, rather than the current simple majority. In the view of Dennis Polhill of the Independence Institute, in Golden, the plan is to "take power out of the hands of the voters and thereby allow the general assembly, the courts, and the executive branch to operate without fear of citizen initiative." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This hostility of legislators toward initiatives is not confined to Colorado. In fact, it may be the rule. Twenty-six states do not permit them at all, and many legislators in the states that do regard them as an unwarranted end run around their own authority. Sometimes, legislatures stymie the implementation of initiatives passed by voters.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the other hand, citizen initiatives have sometimes presaged nationwide movements in such issues as tax reform and term limits. State activists are currently circulating groundbreaking petitions that would allow public employees to avoid compulsory union membership, either grant or prohibit legal protections based on sexual orientation, and cap lawyers' contingency fees, among other things.	<p>

<h2> Making Public Schools Safe for Religion </h2>
<b>by Joe Loconte </b>
<p><p><P></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even in the lazy days of summer, when most schools are as noisy as a mausoleum, classrooms are rattling with the ghosts of First Amendment debates left unresolved: A parent sues a Mississippi school district for allowing prayers over the school intercom. A California high school prevents students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia bars a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, conservatives in Congress may soon unveil a religious-liberty amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as promised by House Speaker Newt Gingrich after the Republican victories in November 1994. <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.121:">One version of the bill</a>, introduced by Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, would not allow any government agency to "deny benefits or otherwise discriminate against any private person or group on account of religious expression." Supporters hope the bill's language will prevent educators from muzzling legitimate forms of religious speech--from class reports to lunchroom prayers.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues, isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to James Madison's historic formula for church-state relations. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "I would argue that we still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Making the Amendment "work" first means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, collaborates with Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center. Both played a role in getting religious and civil-liberties groups last year to sign a Joint Statement of Current Law, outlining wide freedoms for student-initiated speech (see sidebar, page 21).
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But just because religious expression is legal does not mean it is uncontroversial. Working district by district, Haynes and Thomas are bringing together educators, parents, and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules for setting policies on religion in schools: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, even those of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debate must always be conducted with respect and civility.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for "rights," "responsibilities," and "respect"), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="http://lsnt7.lightspeed.net/~mgehrett/nation.htm">Christian Educators Association International</a>, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states--including Georgia, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah--are moving ahead with the initiative as even their most homogenous school districts absorb rising numbers of ethnic and religious minorities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The lesson is that pluralism need not hush all religious voices in public schools. Haynes insists that the First Amendment is animated by a respect for individual conscience, and that it implies a set of civic principles for affirming religion in the public square--in all its diversity. "If it's done right, the First Amendment will make the schools, for the first time in our history, places where deeply religious people will feel confident in sending their children to be educated," Haynes says. "But getting it right is going to take a great deal of work."
<p>
<b>Diversity Central</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's painfully true in California, eventual home to roughly 25 percent of all who immigrate to the United States each year. The state draws large numbers of racial and religious minorities; the student body in some districts comprises up to 90 different native languages--and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Church-state disputes came to a boil in 1990, when the state prodded public schools to adopt a social-studies curriculum that teaches the central role of religion in U.S. and world history. Most schools weren't ready: Teachers typically received little or no training in world religions or in raising religious issues in class. During public hearings on proposed textbooks, police were actually called out to restore order.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Haynes and Thomas met with school officials and community leaders throughout California. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and then build community support. If all of that sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is--and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the Snowline School District in southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for another contentious church-state drama: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; a school-board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library, but officials were unsure whether the school was allowed to use them; a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer, but a parent objected.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The community, however, was ready. Snowline had recently adopted the Three Rs Project to accommodate the religious-liberty rights of an increasingly diverse school system of 6,000 students. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad."
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That's a deceptively simple manifesto: Bewilderment, misconceptions, and fear of religion still grip many school districts. The church-state questions at Snowline, for example, all involved acts considered defensible under federal court rulings--and yet incidents like them tend to provoke bitter lawsuits or muffle legitimate expressions of faith. "Most teachers are extremely wary of allowing any religious expression in their classroom because they are afraid they may be breaking the law," says Jennifer Norton, a high-school teacher in Jackson, California, who has trained more than 250 teachers in the Three Rs program.
<p>
<b>New York State of Mind</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	To creche or not to creche, as the school's superintendent puts it--that was the question that sent tremors through the South Orangetown District in Rockland, New York, several years ago. The school followed a now-familiar script: The topic of Christmas and Hanukkah decorations in district classrooms provoked heated public discussions. Unable to reach compromise, school officials banned the display of any religious symbols. "We were trying to teach tolerance, but many people felt we were teaching people to be afraid of asking questions," says Phoebe Rosenwasser, a PTA co-president and the parent of four children attending public schools in the district.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To ease tensions, newly arrived school superintendent Mort Sherman helped form a "We the People" committee modeled on the Three Rs program. After several community meetings, the school board last fall approved a policy instructing district schools to teach about religion at virtually all grade levels. "The proper role of religion in the public schools is in its educational value and not in religious observance nor in religious celebration," the policy states. The committee is now placing curriculum development among the district's top priorities.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"You won't walk into our classrooms and see Christmas trees or creches or menorahs," Sherman says. "But you can walk into our classrooms and hear discussions about what Christmas means. . . . It's part of the formal curriculum." Says Rosenwasser, "It's done a marvelous job of bringing us together."
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Haynes dared to imagine such results nearly a decade ago, when he joined the Williamsburg Charter project to commemorate the bicentennial of the First Amendment. That effort, led by social thinker Os Guinness, brought together a national cast of politicians, educators, and religious leaders to publicly agree on the Amendment's intended role in American life: to nurture religion.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The charter, though successful as a public compact, lacked the practical tools to affect local policy. Haynes and Thomas produced a handbook for teachers and administrators called <I>Finding Common Ground: A First Amendment Guide to Religion and Public Education.</I> A comprehensive look at legal and practical questions about the relationship between church and state, it forms the basis of the Three Rs program.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Haynes agrees with conservatives and others who see widespread secularism in the nation's classrooms as inherently dangerous to democracy. Sociologist Peter Berger writes that one of the hallmarks of totalitarianism is the urge to drive underground man's quest for God--to impose everywhere "a world without windows." Haynes fears that such is the world being created behind many schoolhouse doors. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But he also seems eager to remind audiences of the perils of majoritarian religion. He takes issue with some conservative Christians who recall 19th- or early 20th-century America as a golden era of religious influence in public schools. In fact, Protestants and Catholics argued over which version of the Bible to read and what prayers to say, while Jews and other religious minorities were deeply uncomfortable with the Protestant overtones of their children's instruction.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Religious consensus in the United States is not possible, and any attempt to impose one in public education would be unjust and unconstitutional," Haynes says. "People who look back to the good old days should remember that there were no good old days in public schools. We were very bitterly divided." 
<p>
<b>Unlikely Allies</b> 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given the groups contending for and against a religious-liberty amendment in Congress, the Three Rs Project continues to attract a peculiar coalition of supporters. Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, calls the initiative "indispensable." In December, when Haynes released <I>A Parent's Guide to Religion in the Public Schools,</I> he got the backing of Education Secretary Richard Riley and Joan Dykstra, the president of the National PTA. "The freedom of religion is one of the most important guarantees in our Constitution," Dykstra says, "and continues to be the basis of our nation's strength." Dykstra intends to have 30,000 copies of the guide distributed to PTA presidents nationwide.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a memorandum last year, President Clinton directed the U.S. Department of Education to send guidelines explaining students' religious rights to each of the nation's 14,800 districts. "Nothing in the First Amendment converts our public schools into religion-free zones," Clinton wrote in the memorandum. The guidelines, which borrowed heavily from last year's Joint Statement of Current Law, seem to be diffusing some suspicion about the Three Rs project.
Some groups, however, remain skeptical. Elliot Mincberg, of the liberal group People for the American Way, says he endorses the educational goals of the project but fears that conservatives will use it to further a political agenda--and so remains judicially vigilant. "It's got to be bilateral disarmament,." he says. "I can't disarm as long as they don't."
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Steven McFarland, the director of the Christian Legal Society, doubts that a civic-education project can undo a string of judicial rulings hostile to religion. The Rutherford Institute similarly faults the Clinton directive and the 1995 Joint Statement for ignoring unfavorable court decisions. In <I>DeNooyer v. Livonia Public Schools,</I> for example, a federal court allowed a school to single out a student's religious speech for disparate treatment. "Only an amendment can head off decades of additional discrimination and costly lawsuits," McFarland recently told <I>Christianity Today.</I>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Haynes, Thomas, and scores of educators and parents are betting against such a forecast. They're convinced that changes in public attitudes about religion must come from the bottom up--one school district at a time. They consider the breakdown in trust in public education as a threat to civil society; such trust, they argue, cannot be restored until schools break their silence about the historic role of faith in American culture.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"We can take religion seriously in public education while protecting the conscience of every parent and student," Haynes says. "But we cannot go forward as a country if we try to keep religion out of the schools. . . . There is simply no choice but to try to get this right."

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over the past few months, the V-chip has quickly become the most celebrated piece of computer circuitry in America. In swift succession, President Clinton championed this little byte of technology in his State of the Union address, Congress passed legislation mandating its use, and the major networks grumbled loudly about challenging the law in court. The drama finally culminated in February at a summit at the White House, where the TV industry's chieftains grudgingly accepted the president's challenge to do more for America's parents and create a ratings system compatible with the V-chip.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The story of the V-chip unfolded so fast, and its potential impact is so great, that the media has spent most of its time struggling to answer a host of basic questions: How does this signal-blocking technology work? When will it be available? How much will it cost? Will it live up to its billing? Some are still not even sure what the "V" actually stands for. (It originally stood for "violence," but it seems everyone has their own interpretation. I hope it comes to mean "values.")
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a Senate cosponsor of the V-chip bill along with Democrat Kent Conrad, I know these details matter, but I also believe the media's focus on them has obscured a larger point. Far more important than what the "V" stands for is what the coming of the V-chip tells us about the public's plummeting regard for the product that television delivers to our homes. Although this invention may merely be an irritant to those in the television business, to millions of Americans the V-chip is a surrogate for their anger at the entertainment industry for degrading our culture and our society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That anger is clearly reflected in any number of public opinion polls, which uniformly show that the public is fed up with the rising tide of sex, violence, and vulgarity in the entertainment media. These surveys are useful, but based on my conversations with people in diners, schools, and small businesses back in Connecticut, I believe they barely begin to measure the public's intense feelings toward television.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My experience tells me that beneath the surface of the Telecommunications Revolution bubbles a revolution of another kind -- a "Revolt of the Revolted," as <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and I have taken to calling it. It is being fueled by a growing sense that our culture is not only out of touch with the values of mainstream America, but out of control as well. Many people believe that there are no standards that television will not violate, no lines television will not cross. Broadcasters may see the V-chip as a threat to their independence and financial well-being, but many average citizens see television as a threat to their children and their country. In the V-chip, they perceive a modicum of protection for their families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why are people afraid of television? Much of the news media has focused on the violence, but that is only part of the problem. Millions of Americans are fed up with explicit sex scenes and crude language during prime time and with the pornographic content of those abysmal talk shows and soap operas during the day. They feel television is not only offensive, but on the offensive, assaulting the values they and most of their neighbors share.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	People are angry because they cannot sit down to watch TV with their children without fearing they will be embarrassed or demeaned. And they are angry because they feel our culture has been hijacked and replaced with something alien to their lives, something that openly rejects rather than reflects the values they try to instill in their families. In the world they see on TV, sex is a recreational pastime, indecency is a cause for laughter, and humans are killed as casually and senselessly as bugs. It is a coarse caricature of the America they love.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	David Levy, the executive producer of the Caucus for Producers, Writers, and Directors, aptly describes this situation as "television without representation." Some critics tell me that, in the zealous pursuit of the prized demographic cohort of young adults, the industry has shut out the rest of the public, and let the tastes of a few dictate the menu for all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Average viewers may not be aware of market dynamics at work, but they certainly understand the consequences. They have a growing sense that the anything-goes mentality permeating our electronic culture contributes to the moral crisis facing America. I believe this notion -- that the contemporary entertainment culture is affecting our values in a deeply troubling way -- is at the core of the brewing cultural rebellion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a very anxious time in our history. The bonds of trust that people once took for granted in their neighborhoods and schools and workplaces are withering, and the social order that once anchored their lives and their communities is breaking apart. Stability is giving way to an increasingly chaotic and threatening world in which a snowball fight can quickly escalate into fatal shotgun blasts, as happened recently on a major thoroughfare in the city of Hartford.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The source of this social breakdown, many people believe, is the collapse of fundamental values. A critical connection exists between the erosion of morals and the explosion of social pathologies around us -- brutal violence committed more and more often by strangers, the disintegration of the family, the epidemic of illegitimacy. In much the same way, many of us see a critical link between this erosion of values and the plummeting standards of decency on television and in our culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some in the entertainment industry continue to argue that they are merely holding up a mirror to our culture, and scoff at the notion that the entertainment culture is responsible for all our social ills. The time has come to take a torch to this straw man. Neither President Clinton nor <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> nor I nor anyone I know is suggesting that any individual entertainment product, or even the whole of the entertainment industry, has single-handedly caused the rise in juvenile violence or illegitimacy. We are saying that the entertainment culture is immensely powerful, more powerful than any lawmaker in Washington, and that this power is wielded in ways that make our country's problems worse, not better.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider a few facts. There are 95 million households in America with televisions, which means more households own TV sets than telephones. Sixty-five percent of those homes have at least two TVs, which on average are turned on seven hours a day. The typical child watches 25 hours of television every week. That is more time than most of them spend attending religious services, talking to their parents, reading books, or even listening to their teachers. Many kids spend more time watching television than any other activity except sleeping.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No one can seriously deny the potential influence that kind of constant exposure carries with it. And because of that power, those responsible for television programming do not just mirror, but also mold, attitudes and behaviors. Whether they want the responsibility or not, they are influencing our values. And whenever they air degrading programs, they contribute to -- not cause, but contribute to -- the moral and social breakdown we are suffering.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So many studies have documented the threat posed by steady exposure to violence on television that the point should not even be subject to debate. But to add yet another voice to the mix, consider this passage from a stunning article Adam Walinsky wrote last year in the Atlantic Monthly, in which he warned of a coming generation of "superfelons" who when they mature will likely make the cities of today look peaceful:
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media violence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may feature scores of killings in two hours time, vying to show methods ever more horrific. . . . Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their listeners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill police. . . . These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you read."
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The media's messages are not transforming these young people into killers, Walinsky says, but they are feeding into a cycle of violence that is getting harder and harder to break and that has dire repercussions for our country. Much the same could be said about the effect of sexual messages sent to our children. No single show is corrupting America's youth, or creating the epidemic of teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. But television as a whole says over and over to our children that sex is as devoid of consequences as a game of charades, and they are missing out on something great if they don't have sex right away. It is hardly surprising, then, that a recent poll of kids aged 10 to 16 found that nearly two-thirds believe TV encourages them to become sexually active too soon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you still doubt the influence that television wields, just listen to America's parents. I cannot tell you how many times I've heard mothers and fathers say that they feel locked in a struggle with the powerful forces of the electronic culture to shape their children's values -- and that they're losing. They feel that television and the culture undermine their fundamental duty as a parent -- teaching right and wrong, instilling a sense of discipline -- and that their kids' lives are increasingly controlled by careless strangers a world away.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the concept of the V-chip is so appealing to parents. It offers them a silicon hard hat to protect their kids from television's falling standards. The implications of the V-chip's popularity are remarkable. The public feels so strongly that their children need to be shielded from words and images in the entertainment media that they are turning to the government for help -- not censorship, but help. Considering the low esteem with which Americans today regard Washington, this should tell us something about the public's faith and trust in the TV industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The public's fear and anger is understandable when you consider the industry's thoughtless response to its concerns. For instance, after hearing a growing chorus of complaints last year about the quality of prime-time programming, capped by last summer's debate in Congress over the V-chip, the major networks reacted by unleashing what critics widely assailed as the crudest, rudest new fall season in history. All too typical were scenes like the one from <I>Bless This House</I> on CBS, broadcast during the old Family Hour, when a female character said she was so sex-starved that she wanted to "do it on the coffee table." To that another character responded, "Don't you ever get your period?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This rash of vulgarity is only the latest step down in an ongoing trend. A study done by a research team at Southern Illinois University recently found that the frequency of indecent and profane language during prime time had increased 45 percent from 1990 to 1994.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the most disturbing thing about this fall's "slow slide into the gutter," as the <I>Hartford Courant</I>'s TV critic called it, was that much of it was happening in the 8 p.m. time slot when millions of children are watching. As the Media Research Center documented in a recent report, this crossover marked the death knell of the traditional Family Hour. Among other things, this study found that in 117 hours of programming reviewed over a recent four-week period, 72 curse words were used, including 29 uses of the word "ass," 13 uses of "bitch" and 10 uses of "bastard."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If these developments are not enough to drive parents to embrace the V-chip, then consider how several network executives responded recently to criticism of the decline in prime-time standards. One top official's justification was that "sexual innuendoes are part of life." Another said, "Society has become crasser, and we move with that." And yet another said, "It is not the role of network TV to program for the children of America."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After hearing these comments, I can't help but ask how these industry leaders would feel if I came into their home and used some of this kind of foul language in front of their children. I doubt they would stand for it. But why then do they feel it is perfectly acceptable and appropriate to use that kind of language in my home, in front of my child? That is essentially what is happening when they decide to send these shows into my living room -- they are speaking to me and my family, which includes my eight-year-old daughter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The same question could be asked of the major syndicators who produce and distribute the daytime "trash TV" talk shows. I recently joined <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and Sam Nunn in a public campaign to focus attention on these degrading, offensive, and exploitative programs. The point we are trying to make is there are some things that are so morally repugnant that they should not be broadcast for mass consumption, least of all by the eight million children who watch these shows regularly. The examples we cite, such as the teenage girl who slept with more than a hundred men, or women who marry their rapists, were unequivocally beyond the pale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yet, although we have received comprehensive public support for our efforts, not one of the major communications companies that own the shows we raised concerns about -- such as Gannett, Tribune, Sony, Time Warner, Viacom -- would publicly acknowledge that their products were problematic in any way. Nor, to our disappointment, has the leadership of the broadcasting industry stepped forward to talk about this genre's excesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those same corporate leaders tried to kill the V-chip in its legislative crib, and for a long time they seemed prepared to pursue a court challenge at all costs. But to their credit, the networks and the National Association of Broadcasters dropped their opposition following the president's appeal in his State of the Union address and agreed (albeit reluctantly) to create a comprehensive, self-enforced rating system. Regardless of how it came to pass, this was a historic breakthrough. The tools offered by the V-chip and a ratings system will go a long way toward empowering parents to keep overly violent and offensive programs out of their homes and out of reach of their children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the industry must realize that these tools will not eliminate the fundamental problem that is fueling the deep-seated anger felt by so many Americans: the deterioration of the industry's programming standards. The V-chip is no panacea; the harmful messages abounding on television are still going to reach many young kids. Moreover, the V-chip is no substitute for network responsibility, for recognizing that the programming they send into our homes carries with it enormous influence. Simply put, the American public wants more from television than just good warnings on bad programming.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There is some reason for hope. A growing chorus of voices within the industry is calling for fundamental changes in the way television does business. For instance, in a recent high-profile speech, Richard Frank, the president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, recently said, "Why do you think people such as C. Delores Tucker, William Bennett, Tipper Gore, Reed Hundt and many others are attacking music and the media? Because <I>the reality is frightening</I>" (emphasis added). Frank went on to urge the industry to use the enormous power at its disposal to take some risks and set higher standards. "We cannot and will not ignore the important issues facing television," he said. "We must deal with them responsibly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most important steps the industry can take now to address the concerns we have raised, and to begin to restore public confidence in its programming, would be to adopt once again a voluntary code of conduct. I know that some in the creative community will charge that such a code is an attempt to chill their free speech, but the truth is that self-regulation is common sense, not censorship. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The time has come to recognize that not every aberrant behavior or hostile voice has the right to be featured on television on a daily basis, especially at times when large numbers of children are watching. That means asking the industry to draw some lines which programmers cannot and will not cross, something Court TV has already done by adopting a code of ethics for its own programming.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I hope that the industry will include in any voluntary code they develop a commitment to bring back the Family Hour and to recreate a safe haven for children during prime time. The major broadcast networks would not only be helping parents by taking this step, they would also be helping themselves. There clearly is a market for high-quality, family-friendly material, as evidenced by the fact that Nickelodeon was the top-rated cable network in the nation last year. This channel has viewers that ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox could win back.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lastly, we must not just focus on what is bad about television, we must also talk about what could be good and even great about television. One of the most revealing studies I've come across recently showed that at-risk children who watch <I>Sesame Street</I> score significantly higher on math and verbal tests than peers who do not. Just imagine what we could do for the nation's children if there were 20 variations of <I>Sesame Street</I> to choose from after school instead of 20 <I>Jerry Springers</I>. While that is not likely to happen any time soon, it's a safe bet that the president and many others will continue to push the industry to increase the amount of quality educational programming for kids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These are just a few suggestions. The devil here is not in the details but in the big picture -- or rather, in all the troubling pictures and words the TV industry is pumping into our homes, and in the damage that the sum of those messages inflicts upon our society. The people who run television have a choice before them: Respond to this Revolt of the Revolted, or face the Sentinels of Censorship. The last thing I want is the government setting standards, but I fear the public will soon turn again to Congress to take stronger actions if the TV industry continues on its path downward.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must avoid that outcome at all costs. To do so, the TV industry must see the V-chip for the powerful symbol of discontent it is, and treat it as a beginning and not an end. More and more these days television is becoming a pariah in America's living rooms, and no slice of silicon can block out that reality.<p>

<title>Trade Secrets: Global Markets Spur Toledo's Turnaround - Policy Review - May-June 96</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>Trade Secrets<br>
<i>Global markets spur Toledo's turnaround</i></h2>
<p>
<b>By Christopher Garcia</b> <p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>May-June 1996, Number 77</i> <hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If we didn't have international trade, we'd lose jobs," says Bob Babcock, a sorter at Sauder Woodworking Co. in Toledo, Ohio. Babcock had been laid off for 18 months before finding uninterrupted employment at Sauder, which exports to 70 countries worldwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"If we can't win in the international market, then something is wrong with us," adds Harry Eschedor, an employee at New Mather Metals, Inc., a Japanese-owned firm in Toledo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 Even union leaders agree. "Everybody has to have free trade -- it's a global market," says Ron Conrad, United Auto Workers unit chairman at Chrysler's Jeep assembly plant in Toledo. "Our philosophy is not Pat Buchanan's philosophy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Holy Toledo! Isn't this Ohio city the kind of blue-collar, ethnic town that was supposed to falter in a world of computerization and global competition? Didn't Toledoans watch thousands of auto-parts jobs flee overseas in the late 1970s? Weren't they handed pink slips when Owen-Illinois and Owens-Corning downsized in the 1980s? Weren't they jarred by the takeover of glassmaker Libbey-Owens-Ford by Britain's Pilkington? And isn't this the Toledo whose unemployment rate soared to 12.6 percent in 1982? In short, isn't this the kind of Rust Belt community that economic nationalists want to protect with a wall of tariffs and protective barriers? What's going on?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Trade, trade, trade. Refusing to turn its back on the world, Toledo has turned rust to riches by exploiting international trade opportunities. As a result, employment has reached a 25-year high, unemployment has plummeted to 4.8 percent, manufacturing jobs are growing at 7 percent a year, and waiting lists have formed for the 300-500 new housing units under construction downtown. Meanwhile, community life is flourishing -- from taverns to bowling alleys to Rotary Clubs. Notwithstanding the griping of economic nationalists, Toledoans are proving that exports and imports translate into more than just low prices and expanded consumer choice. They mean good jobs at good wages and vibrant, healthy American communities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Evidence of Toledo's global efforts can be found everywhere. In 1991, Burlington Air Express located its international hub in this northwest Ohio city. Burlington now employs 1,000 Toledoans and ships two million pounds of air freight a day from Toledo to destinations including Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In 1993 Toledo created an International Studies Center to teach students and businessmen Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Russian, and Spanish. Says Joe Rutherford, a former assistant superintendent of schools, "Learning foreign languages is part of our economic-development strategy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At the center of Toledo's comeback stands Chrysler's Jeep plant. Originally built in the 1880s, this factory is the oldest continuously operating auto-assembly plant in the United States -- and looks it. An antique brick smoke stack, still belching smoke, bears the name of Willys-Overland, the plant's one-time occupant and long-forgotten jeep inventor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the plant's time-worn exterior belies its vitality. Inside, scores of Jeep workers busily inspect Jeep Cherokees under a banner that reads, "The customer is our final inspector." The final inspector for many of these Cherokees will be Japanese. Or Chinese. Or Egyptian. This year the plant will ship 40,000-50,000 Cherokees, or 30 percent of its total production, to 130 international destinations. And these figures do not include exports to Canada, whose market is so integrated with our own that it is not measured separately. Nor does it include the completed but disassembled Jeeps the plant will ship to China, Egypt, Venezuela, and Argentina.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The plant almost closed in the mid-1980s. "We had let our guard down a bit," explains Toledo Mayor Carleton Finkbeiner. "We had become comfortable with our market share, but our days of domination were over." International competitors were beating the overalls off of American automakers, and Chrysler could not afford to operate Jeep factories in both Toledo and Kenosha, Wisconsin.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our plant generated more workmen's compensation costs than the rest of the Chrysler assembly plants combined," admits Ron Conrad of the UAW. To boost production, Jeep workers have slashed workmen's comp costs and lost-time injuries by 41 percent since 1990, and have cut employees' grievances from 1,665 in 1985 to 30 today. Workers at Jeep have even initiated a Product Quality Improvement (PQI) program in which Jeep employees work in teams (there are now 282) to identify ways to cut costs and generate efficiencies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to its higher productivity, this plant survived to become the first American auto plant to produce right-hand-drive vehicles for Japanese and European markets. In 1995, the plant shipped 30,000 right-hand-drive Cherokees overseas, up from 18,000 in 1994. This year it will send 12,000 to Japan, 25,000 to Europe, and thousands more to Australia. Jeep has shaped up to ship out: Exports constitute this plant's fastest-growing market.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such success benefits the local economy, not just Chrysler's shareholders. "We have used the growth in the export market to grow our plant," says Gerald Huber, a Toledo plant manager  until his recent promotion. A plant that in 1973 employed approximately 3,000 Toledoans now employs 5,600. Workers earn $45,000-$50,000 a year, on average, and were rewarded for their efforts in 1994 with $8,000 profit-sharing checks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jeep's recovery has been a boon for community life on Toledo's historically Polish North Side. A shop called Cakes, Candies, and Crafts is doing a thriving business teaching locals how to make <I>pierogi</I> (Polish dumplings). Betty and David's restaurant, located across the street from St. Wojciecha's church, serves one of the best breakfasts in town to a full house every morning. Real estate is "as good or better than it's ever been," says Brent Gagn, who has sold real estate in Toledo since 1971. In the mid-1980s joblessness made it difficult for people to qualify for a mortgage, and seller-assisted financing constituted 75 percent of Gagn's business. Today's buyers get mortgages on their own. And two of the North Side's most venerable institutions, Central Catholic High School and St. Vincent's Medical Center, recently made capital investments that will keep them in the North Side well into the next century.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	John Henry Fullin, a North Side resident, talks about "an explosion of people getting involved to make things better." North Side denizens, for example, have devised a community-policing program that has reduced crime 42 percent. And many residents have become involved in Toledo's volunteer-based Sister Cities program with foreign cities. Through Sister Cities, residents established a Jeep dealership in Szeged, Hungary, that now imports Jeeps from the Toledo plant.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Jeep is not the only company in the greater Toledo area to have hitched its wagon to the global market, nor is the North Side the only Toledo community to reap the benefits of international trade. Companies throughout the region demonstrate that imports and foreign direct investment, in addition to exports, can benefit communities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New Mather Metals produces stabilizer bars, which control automobile suspension systems during cornering. It has been a staple on the North Side for 80 years. In 1987, the company employed 70 workers. It now employs 175, and its growth shows no sign of slowing. The plant recently purchased two pieces of property and plans to add four new production lines, or 20 new jobs. While New Mather ships a small percentage of its stabilizer bars directly overseas, its domestic customers install a large percentage of New Mather's bars in cars intended for overseas markets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sauder Woodworking Co., situated west of town, is the world's largest manufacturer of ready-to-assemble (RTA) furniture. RTA furniture is made of particle board that is covered with micropaper laminate to give it the appearance of genuine oak or cherrywood. Approximately 260 Sauder workers owe their jobs to exports, and international sales, which have skyrocketed 400 percent the last five years, will soon enable Sauder to add 750,000 square feet of factory space to its existing facility.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Delta, an industrial suburb, a primarily residential landscape is being interrupted by the construction of a $425-million steel mini-mill. The mill will recycle scrap steel from junked cars and appliances and will generate 350 jobs and $16 million in payroll. A portion of the steel processed at this mill will be exported to Canada, helping revise America's recent record as a steel importer.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Imports and foreign direct investment are essential to these businesses. Delta's mini-mill, for example, is a joint venture between a privately held American firm and Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia. New Mather Metals, on the other hand, is entirely foreign-owned. It was bought in 1987 by NHK Spring of Yokahama, Japan, to supply Japanese car makers. And in a business where a table is often judged by its cover, Sauder imports from Japan the micropaper it uses to cover its furniture. New Mather also imports: Nearly all of its equipment comes from Japan. Jobs at Sauder, New Mather, and Northstar/BHP are bound up with either foreign money, foreign imports, or both.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with the Jeep plant, the success of these companies in the global market affects the communities around them. Just ask Anne Summers, who owns a bar called The Village Tavern in Delta. "If you drink in this town, I probably know you," she boasts. But Summers twice considered closing her doors in the 1980s, because factory closings emptied her bar stools. Now business is booming. With a gleam in her eye, she reports that contractors will employ 3,000 workers this summer to complete construction of the mill. Summers is also excited that her two grandchildren will benefit from a new computer lab Northstar/BHP has installed in the local public elementary school.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Back in Toledo, a different small business is feeling the effects of the export-led surge in employment. Tony Packo's, a restaurant made famous by the 1970s hit sitcom M*A*S*H and well known for its Hungarian hot dogs, has served the Hungarian community for more than 60 years. Antique signs bearing the names of companies from Toledo's industrial past, like Champion, remind visitors that Packo's has seen the best and worst of Toledo's fortunes. Diana Chastien, a Packo's manager, has just hired five new employees and plans to hire more. She attributes a recent surge in the establishment's business to the turnaround in the Toledo economy. She has also noticed that Hungarians who had moved out of the community during the downturn in the 1980s are moving back.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even bowling seems to be affected. Bowling in Toledo had declined during the lean 1980s, when cheaper forms of entertainment, like video rentals, became popular, but has held its own in the 1990s. Larry Nworowski, the president of the Greater Toledo Bowling Association, reports that leagues will even gain a couple of hundred bowlers this year. Approximately 25,000 Toledoans bowl in league play -- out of a total metropolitan population of 750,000. In Toledo, it seems, citizens don't bowl alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, everywhere you turn in Toledo international trade seems to be leaving its imprint. Demand for hotel rooms is up 20 percent from last year. Kevin Mann, a clerk at the Fairfield Inn, attributes full occupancy there to "international types." Convention business is also booming. In February, Toledo hosted the International Air Cargo convention. And international companies are supporting philanthropic causes like the revitalization of the century-old Valentine Theater and the construction of a center for science and industry.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The volume of international freight passing through Toledo is one final but important sign of the impact of trade on Toledo. The port of Toledo exported 2.8 million tons of freight to Canada, Japan, Europe, and Africa last year. Five thousand people earn $110 million in payroll in jobs related to the port's trade activities. Sauder itself sends 105 truckloads of furniture out a week, a good portion of which is destined for international markets. And trucks will line up all year to carry 50,000 Cherokees to all international points.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toledo isn't the only American community prospering thanks to international trade. International powerhouses Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Hills Pet Products have helped create 12,000 jobs in Topeka, Kansas, since 1988. John Deere's Augusta, Georgia, tractor plant expanded its payroll 50 percent last year while importing parts from 10 countries and exporting tractors to 33. In Priest River, Idaho, Hartford Communications, a firm that refurbishes telephone systems and whose export sales are growing 50 percent a year, is hiring unemployed lumber workers. And in Rochester, New Hampshire, the state's second-largest employer, Cabletron, which will derive 50 percent of its revenues from exports by 1997, is hiring five Rochesterites a day. The list goes on.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But protectionist doomsayers insist that American communities like these can't survive without tariff and quota walls -- a kind of government-enforced affirmative-action program for U.S.-made goods. It seems of little consequence to them that America has become the world's largest exporter under a free trade regime. U.S. exports have grown more than 45 percent in the last 10 years and 12 million Americans now work in export-dependent jobs. Trade free of government interference is vital to the millions of Americans and thousands of American communities benefiting from it. Says New Mather's Eschedor, "Protectionist countries only push their people backwards. Our jobs, our prosperity, and our future depend on free trade."<p>

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>May-June 1996, Number 77</i><hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The Founders of our nation understood that no idea was more central to our Bill of Rights -- indeed, to government of the people, by the people, and for the people -- than the citizen jury. It was cherished not only as a bulwark against tyranny but also as an essential means of educating Americans in the habits and duties of citizenship. By enacting the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution, the Framers sought to install the right to trial by jury as a cornerstone of a free society.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today that cornerstone is crumbling. In recent years, a parade of notorious criminal trials has called into question the value of citizen juries. The prosecutions of Oliver North, O.J. Simpson, William Kennedy Smith, the Menendez brothers, and the assailants of Rodney King and Reginald Denny have made armchair jurors of millions of Americans. Now the failings of the system seem obvious to anyone with a television:
<ul><p><li> In search of "impartial" jurors, the selection process seems stacked against the educated, the perceptive, and the well informed in favor of those more easily manipulated by lawyers and judges. Attorneys exercising their rights to strike candidates from the pool cynically and slyly seek to exclude jurors on the basis of race, gender, and other supposed indicators of bias.<P>
<li> Courts subject citizens to repeated summonses, intrusive personal questioning, and long and inefficient trials. Unsurprisingly, many citizens avoid jury duty.<p>
<li> In court, jurors serve a passive role dictated by rules that presume jurors are incapable of impartial deliberation and that provide little help in understanding points of law or evaluating testimony.<p>
<li> The public perceives that the scales of justice tip in favor of rich defendants with high-priced counsel.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	More than a million Americans serve as jurors on state courts each year. Jury service offers these Americans an unequaled opportunity to participate democratically in the administration of justice. But on its present course, this vital egalitarian institution may shrivel up, avoided by citizens, manipulated by lawyers and litigants, and ridiculed by the general public. To be sure, the system has inherent limitations; "correct" verdicts cannot be guaranteed. But given the jury's present form, society is bearing the costs of a jury system's vices without enjoying a jury system's virtues. Our task is to demonstrate why the citizen jury is worth defending, and to propose a number of specific reforms designed to restore the jury to its rightful status in a democracy under law.<p><b>A Cornerstone of Democracy</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Framers of the Constitution felt that juries -- because they were composed of ordinary citizens and because they owed no financial allegiance to the government -- were indispensable to thwarting the excesses of powerful and overzealous government officials. The jury trial was the only right explicitly included in each of the state constitutions penned between 1776 and 1789. And the criminal jury was one of few rights explicitly mentioned in the original federal constitution proposed by the Philadelphia Convention. Anti-federalists complained that the proposed constitution did not go far enough in protecting juries, and federalists eventually responded by enacting three constitutional amendments guaranteeing grand, petit, and civil juries.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The need for juries was especially acute in criminal cases: A grand jury could block any prosecution it deemed unfounded or malicious, and a petit jury could likewise interpose itself on behalf of a defendant charged unfairly. The famous Zenger case in the 1730s dramatized the libertarian advantages of juries. When New York's royal government sought to stifle its newspaper critics through criminal prosecution, New York grand juries refused to indict, and a petit jury famously refused to convict.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the Founders' vision of the jury went far beyond merely protecting defendants. The jury's democratic role was intertwined with other ideas enshrined in the Bill of Rights, including free speech and citizen militias. The jury was an essential democratic institution because it was a means by which citizens could engage in self-government. Nowhere else -- not even in the voting booth -- must Americans come together in person to deliberate over fundamental matters of justice. Jurors face a solemn obligation to overlook personal differences and prejudices to fairly administer the law and do justice. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the great historian of anti-federalist thought, Herbert Storing, put it, "The question was not fundamentally whether the lack of adequate provision for jury trial would weaken a traditional bulwark of individual rights (although that was also involved) but whether it would fatally weaken the role of the people in the administration of government." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps most important was the jury's educational mission. Through the jury, citizens would learn self-government by doing it. In the words of Alexis de Tocqueville, "The jury is both the most effective way of establishing the people's rule and the most effective way of teaching them how to rule." This learning, of course, would carry over to other political activity. As Tocqueville explained: 
<blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Juries, especially civil juries, instill some of the habits of the judicial mind into every citizen, and just those habits are the very best way of preparing people to be free. . . . They make all men feel that they have duties toward society and that they take a share in its government. By making men pay more attention to things other than their own affairs, they combat that individual selfishness which is like rust in society. . . . [The jury] should be regarded as a free school which is always open and in which each juror learns his rights, . . . and is given practical lessons in the law. . . . I think that the main reason for the . . . political good sense of the Americans is their long experience with juries in civil cases."</blockquote>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Once we see how juries serve as major avenues for popular education and political participation, the connections early American observers drew between jury service and other means of political participation -- especially voting -- make more sense. Tocqueville keenly understood these linkages: "The jury system as understood in America seems to me to be as direct and extreme a consequence of the . . . sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage. They are both equally powerful means of making the majority prevail. . . . The jury is above all a political institution [and] should be made to harmonize with the other laws establishing the sovereignty. . . . For society to be governed in a settled and uniform manner, it is essential that the jury lists should expand or shrink with the lists of voters. . . .
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"[In general] in America all citizens who are electors have the right to be jurors."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have come to think of voting as the quintessential act of democratic participation. Historically, the role of the people in serving on juries was often likened to the role of voters selecting legislative bodies, and even to the role of legislators themselves. Indeed, the jury's place in the judicial framework was closely related to the idea of bicameralism: Just as the legislature comprised two equal branches, an upper and a lower, juries and judges constituted the lower and upper branches, respectively, of the judicial department.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Supreme Court has reinforced the linkage of jury service and voting as part of a "package" of political rights. For example, in a 1991 case challenging race-based exclusions in jury selection, Justice Anthony Kennedy observed in his majority opinion that "with the exception of voting, for most citizens the honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process. . . . Whether jury service may be deemed a right, a privilege or a duty, the State may no more extend it to some of its citizens and deny it to others on racial grounds than it may invidiously discriminate in the offering and withholding of the elective franchise."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Later in the same term, Justice Kennedy again invoked the similarity between jury service and voting, observing that just as government cannot escape from constitutional constraints by farming out the tasks of administering elections and registering voters, neither can it evade constitutional norms by giving private parties the power to pick jurors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The link between jury service and other rights of political participation such as voting was also recognized and embraced by the drafters of the Reconstruction amendments and implementing legislation, and still later by authors of various 20th-century voting amendments. For example, the framers of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited race-based discrimination in voting, understood well that the voting they were protecting included voting on juries. That amendment, drafted and ratified in the 1860s, proved to be a template for later amendments protecting women, the poor, and the young from voting discrimination. <p><b>Justice's Weak Link?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The weaknesses of jury trials are sometimes ascribed to the mediocre capacity of ordinary citizens to adjudicate matters of law and fact in an increasingly complex society. It is true that jurors will not always decide "correctly," any more than voters will always choose the most qualified candidates for public office. But the real problem is not that we rely too much on men and women of ordinary intelligence and common sense to decide questions of fact and value in the courtroom. The problem is that we rely too little. The jury is crippled by constraints imposed by the court professionals.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the era of the Founders, the jury was no more egalitarian than was suffrage, limited by race and sex and by tests of personal traits thought necessary for judging cases. Over two centuries, even as the right of jury service was gradually extended to all citizens of voting age, the freedom of jurors to participate in the finding of fact in the courtroom was constricted. Contrary to the spirit in which the jury trial was woven into our constitutional fabric, judges and lawyers have aggrandized their own roles in litigation at the expense of the jury. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The deepest constitutional function of the jury is to serve not the parties but the people -- by involving them in the administration of justice and the grand project of democratic self-government. Alas, over the years, the search for adversarial advantage by attorneys won out over the values of public education and participation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Judges, charged with protecting these enduring constitutional values, have at times done just the opposite in order to maintain their control over trials. The jury was to check the judge -- much as the legislature was to check the executive, the House of Representatives to check the Senate, and the states to check the national government.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is not surprising that we -- as jurors, as citizens -- have not fought off these creeping assaults. The benefits of jury service are widely dispersed -- they redound to fellow citizens as well as the individual jurors. But the individual juror bears all of the cost -- the hassle, the inconvenience, the foregone wages -- of jury service.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the jury system is to remain a central institution of democracy and citizenship, it must be refined. Jury trials must attract engaged and thoughtful citizens; the rules of the courts must treat jurors as sovereign, self-governing citizens rather than as children. To this end, we suggest a number of reforms. In many instances, these changes would require no new laws, but merely a willingness on the part of the courts to unleash the common sense of the ordinary citizen.<P><b>I. Respect jurors</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, we must try to design the system to welcome jurors. All too often they are mistreated by the trial process, forced to wait in cramped and uncomfortable quarters while the judge and lawyers question jury candidates, who are often dismissed from selection without explanation. We should use juries to reconnect citizens with each other and with their government. After serving on a jury, a citizen should, in general, feel better -- less cynical, more public-regarding -- about our system. <p><b>II. Make juries more representative</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Earlier in the nation's history, juries were impaneled under the elitist principle that only the propertied or the highly educated possessed the habits of citizenship needed to serve well. Now that we know better, it is perverse that professional and literate citizens often are exempted or struck from the jury pool. When juries produce stupid verdicts, it is often because we let interested parties pick stupid jurors in stupid ways. It is a scandal that only those who had never heard of Oliver North were permitted to judge him. Now that we have ceded so much control over trials to the court regulars, this shouldn't come as a surprise -- it is akin to letting lobbyists hand-pick candidates for office.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A juror should have an open mind but not an empty mind. We must empower juries in ways that make them more representative and less vulnerable to encroachments of the judicial professionals, without turning them into professionals themselves.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Limit peremptory challenges.</b> By and large, the first 12 persons picked by lottery should form the jury. The jury -- and not just the jury pool summoned for each case -- should be as representative of the entire community as possible. Peremptory challenges (a device that allows lawyers to remove a specified number of jurors from the panel without having to show "cause") should be eliminated; they allow prosecutors and defense attorneys to manipulate demographics and chisel an unrepresentative panel out of a representative pool. Juries should represent the people, not the parties.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the analogies outlined earlier. Our society does not let an individual defendant hand-pick the legislature to fashion the norms governing his conduct; or the prosecutor who pursues him; or the grand jury that indicts him; or the judge who tries him; or the appellate court that reviews his case. We do not set out -- and we'll resist the temptation to wisecrack -- to pick the most stupid people imaginable to populate our legislatures or our judiciary. And we are especially uneasy about depriving citizens of the right to vote on the basis of discretionary criteria that may mask racial or sexual stereotyping.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some major arguments have been advanced to support peremptories. First is the idea of legitimacy: The parties will respect a decision reached by a body they helped to select. But what about the legitimacy of verdicts for the rest of society -- We, the people, whom the jury system is supposed to serve? After all, the parties regard the trial judge, the appellate court, the legislature, and the grand jury as legitimate, even though the defendant didn't personally select any of them or exercise any peremptory challenges. In the name of principle, the court professionals are merely disguising a power grab at the expense of the jury.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, some argue that peremptories allow counsel to probe jurors with incisive questions during the selection process to unearth "cause" to remove particular jurors. Lawyers need peremptories to vigorously exercise this right, the argument goes, lest they offend a juror for whom no provable grounds exist for a "for cause" dismissal. Our response to this is that "for cause" dismissals should be limited; jurors should not have to recuse themselves by different criteria than do judges. If "for cause" challenges are restricted, the prophylactic argument for peremptories collapses.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Supreme Court has made clear that no constitutional right to peremptories exists: They are a relic of an imperfectly democratic past. At the Founding, we suspect, peremptories were exercised mainly as a polite way of dismissing folks with personal knowledge of the parties. In a homogeneous jury pool, peremptory challenges would rarely skew the demographics of the eventual jury. But to vindicate the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, we must close off attempts by lawyers to exploit race and gender in jury selection in a way that deprives some citizens of their right to participate as democratic equals.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Jury pay.</b> We should pay jurors for their time. Payment at a fair, flat rate will permit a broad cross section of society to serve. Our analogy to a bicameral legislature suggests that payment is appropriate, for judges and legislators are paid for their time. To decline to compensate citizens for their sacrifice -- or to pay them a token $5 per day as is done in many California courts -- is in effect to impose a functionally regressive poll tax that penalizes the working poor who want to serve on juries, but who cannot afford the loss of a week's pay. Payment should come from the government, not private employers. All jurors are equal as jurors, and should be paid equally: One person, one vote, one paycheck.<p><b>III. Restore the notion of duty</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jury service is not only a right, but also a duty. Few of us have militantly insisted that we perform this obligation, just as few of us insisted in the last 30 years that we pay our fair share of the intergenerational tax burden. The Economist reports that half of all Californians called for jury duty in the state's criminal courts ignore the summons. Citizens should not escape so easily.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Few exemptions.</b> Exemptions from service should be extremely limited: If you are the brother-in-law of the plaintiff, you may be excused; but you may not be excused merely because you happen to read the newspaper or work in a profession. The idea of the jury is rooted in equality; just as all defendants are treated equally before the law, all jurors have equal claims as well as obligations to play a part in the administration of justice. This measure would expand the size of the jury pool, enforce the universality of required service, and raise the average education level of juries.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Yearly service.</b> The Swiss defend their country with a citizen militia that regularly requires a citizen to serve a periodic stint of active service. Similarly, we should ask each citizen to devote, say, one week a year to jury service, depending on the needs of his or her jurisdiction. Each citizen could register in advance for the week that is most convenient, and except for genuine emergencies, citizens should then be obliged to serve when their turn comes. Courts should be willing to provide professional day care or day-care vouchers to enable homemakers to take their turns in this project in collective self-governance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Enforcing the duty. </b>And how should this obligation be enforced? Progressive fines are probably the best option. If you miss your week, you should pay two weeks' salary. (Flat fines, by contrast, would be functionally regressive and create incentives for highly paid citizens to dodge service.) If for some reason fines didn't work, perhaps we could consider a more radical recoupling of jury service with voting: If you want to opt out of the responsibilities of collective self-government, fine -- but you may not then exercise any of its rights. You may choose to be a citizen, with democratic rights and duties, or a subject, ruled by others. On this view, you are not entitled to vote outside juries if you are unwilling to serve and vote inside juries. If you are not willing to engage in regular focused deliberation with a random cross section of fellow voters, you should not be governing the polity, just as you may not vote in the Iowa presidential caucuses unless you attend and hear the arguments of your peers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Serial jurors.</b> Each jury, once constituted, should be able to try several cases in a row. If you can hear four quick cases in your week a year, so much the better. The grand jury reviews more that one indictment, the judge sits on more than one case, and the legislature may decide more than one issue in a session. The quality of deliberations is likely to improve with practice. The burden of jury service will be more evenly distributed -- one week for everyone -- and more trials can take place if we get rid of all the wasteful preliminaries like elaborate jury questioning and peremptories. Indeed, perhaps a jury should hear both civil and criminal cases in its week. One week a year will not turn citizens into government bureaucrats, though it will give them regular practice in the art of deliberation and self-government.<P><b>IV. Free jurors to do their jobs</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Juries today are often criticized for reaching foolish decisions. But it's not all their fault. Nothing is more important to fulfilling the democratic aims of jury service -- including just outcomes -- than active participation by the jurors. Over the years, the court professionals have conspired to strip jurors of their ability to evaluate the facts. Running the courtroom to maximize their own convenience, they have often slighted the jury's legitimate needs to understand its role, the law, and the facts. The bicameral analogy is instructive: Would we expect the House of Representatives to perform its duties competently if its access to information and ideas were entirely determined by the Senate?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Taking notes. </b> Many judges do not allow jurors to take notes. This is idiocy. Judges take notes, grand jurors take notes, legislators take notes -- what's going on here? This prohibition is based on the misguided beliefs that note-taking distracts jurors from the testimony and that deliberation would be unfairly dominated by jurors with extensive records. Neither fear outweighs the benefit of giving jurors the means to highlight key evidence and keep track of their impressions, particularly in long trials.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Plain-English instructions.</b> Judges should give the panel, at the outset of a case, the basic elements of the charged offenses -- in English, not legalese -- so jurors can consider them and check them off in their notebooks as the trial unfolds.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Questioning of witnesses.</b> Jurors should be allowed to question witnesses by passing queries to the judge. This allows jurors to pierce the selective presentation of facts offered by counsel, and it also keeps jurors more attentive to proceedings. Best of all, it would expose any lingering confusion about testimony in the minds of the jurors, giving prosecutors and defense counsel the chance to address these concerns. Consider, for example, the possibility that each of the jurors in the O.J. Simpson trial had a different pet theory of police conspiracy. If each juror could submit questions, prosecutors would have had an opportunity to understand, address, and debunk many of these mutually inconsistent and factually insupportable theories. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Discussion among jurors prior to deliberation.</b> A ban on such discussion assumes that jurors are superhumanly capable of suspending all judgment for days or weeks and that conversation can only contaminate their faculties. Common sense suggests that it is human nature to form provisional judgments; at least by discussing a case prior to deliberation, jurors can test each other's impressions of the evidence and begin to hone their understandings of key points before these points are lost in the rush of the proceedings. Such a reform must, of course, be accompanied by reminders from the judge that jurors may not reach final conclusions about guilt or innocence until they have heard all the evidence.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Support staff.</b> We should allow juries to hire support staff when it is necessary. In a world of increasing complexity and specialization of labor, few can do an important job well without such help. If legislators and judges can have staffs, why not grand juries? We trivialize jurors when we insist that they alone remain trapped in the 18th-century world of generalists. Perhaps every court should hire a permanent staff with undivided loyalty to the jury itself, and subject to "term limits" to prevent the staff from entrenching itself and using the jury to advance its own agenda.<p><b>V. Avoid hung juries</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When hung juries occur, mistrials waste the time and resources of all concerned. They even harm defendants in cases where the jury was leaning toward acquittal, because a mistrial allows a vindictive prosecutor a second bite at the apple. All this brings us to another controversial -- and we admit extremely tentative -- suggestion. Perhaps, just perhaps, we should move, even in criminal cases, away from unanimity toward majority or supermajority rule on juries. Founding history is relatively clear-a criminal jury had to be unanimous. But this clear understanding was not explicitly inscribed into the Constitution, and the modern Supreme Court has upheld state rules permitting convictions on 10-2 votes. (England today also permits 10-2 verdicts in criminal cases.)
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Three arguments support our suggestion that nonunanimous verdicts should be upheld. First, at the Founding unanimity may have drawn its strength from certain metaphysical and religious ideas about Truth that are no longer plausible: to wit, that all real truths would command universal assent. Second, most of our analogies tug toward majority rule -- used by legislatures, appellate benches, voters, and grand juries -- or supermajority rule: In impeachment proceedings, for example, a two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for conviction.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Last, and most important, all our other suggestions lead the modern American jury system away from its historical reliance on unanimity. At the founding of our nation, unanimity <I>within</I> a jury was nestled in a cluster of other rules that now must fall. In early days, blacks, women, the poor, and the young were excluded from voting and jury service. Peremptory challenges probably made juries even more homogenous. But now that all adult citizens may serve on juries, and we have eliminated all the old undemocratic barriers, preserving unanimity might also be undemocratic, for it would create an extreme minority veto unknown to the Founders. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even at the Founding, unanimous jury verdicts may have existed in the shadow of a custom of majority or supermajority rule. Jurors would discuss the case and vote on guilt; and even if the minority were unconvinced about the verdict, they would in the end vote with the majority after they had been persuaded that the majority had listened to their arguments in good faith. This custom bears some resemblance to legislative "unanimous consent" rules. A single lawmaker may often slow down proceedings -- force her colleagues to deliberate more carefully on something that matters to her -- but in the end she may not prevent the majority from implementing its judgment. Perhaps the same should hold true for juries.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In allowing juries to depart from unanimity, we must try to preserve the ideal of jury deliberation and self-education. Jurors should communicate with each other seriously and with respect. Fans of unanimity argue that it promotes serious deliberation -- everyone's vote is necessary, so everyone is seriously listened to. But unanimity cannot guarantee <I>mutual</I> tolerance: What about an eccentric holdout who refuses to listen to, or even try to persuade, others?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nonunanimous schemes can be devised to promote serious discussion. Jurors should be told that their job is to communicate with others who have different ideas, views, and backgrounds. Judges could also advise jurors that their early deliberations should focus on the evidence and not jurors' tentative leanings or votes, and that they should take no straw polls until each juror has had a chance to talk about the evidence on both sides.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We suggest a scheme in which a jury must be unanimous to convict on the first day of deliberations, but on day two, 11-1 would suffice; on day three, 10-2; and so on, until we hit our bedrock limit of, say, two-thirds (for conviction) or simple majority (for acquittal).<p><b>VI. Educate the People</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once we start thinking about the jury from the perspective of democracy rather than adjudication - from the viewpoint of the citizenry rather than the litigants -- other possibilities open up. Recall Tocqueville's description of the jury as a "free school . . . always open" to educate the people in citizenship. If this is the big idea, why not take advantage of new video technology to advance it? Think of how C-SPAN broadcasts of legislative debates and hearings have contributed to the education of the public. The courts could likewise tape jury deliberations for use as high-school teaching materials about democracy in action (perhaps delaying the release of sensitive cases). Of course, we would have to ensure that these records would not be used to impeach jury verdicts.<p><b>Let the Changes Begin</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The vision we have sketched is a demanding one. Yet many states are already taking up the challenge, enacting reforms by statute or by court policy. The court system of New York state is mulling over reforms to make the experience of serving more efficient and convenient for citizens, and many states already have a one-day, one-trial policy. New Jersey and New York last year joined the 25 or so states that eliminate exemptions based on profession. Arizona is the leader in endorsing proposals, such as note-taking and questioning witnesses, to increase jurors' participation in the process. Oregon and Louisiana allow nonunanimous verdicts in some cases, and Arizona allows a jury to ask the lawyers to explain evidence again if it has reached an impasse in deliberations. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But much more needs to be done. Until America's state and federal judicial systems live up to the ideals embedded in their founding documents and learn to trust the capacity of ordinary citizens to dispense justice, a cornerstone of democracy will continue to crumble.<P><I><b>Akhil Reed Amar</b> is Southmayd Professor of Law at Yale Law School. <b>Vikram David Amar</b> is Acting Professor of Law at the University of California at Davis and a visiting professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	School superintendent Thomas J. Doluisio was puzzled. His Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, district had an elaborate program of Spanish-language classes for its large population of Spanish-speaking children. Proponents of bilingual education said this would help Hispanic children adjust when they moved on to English-only classes -- which they were supposed to do after three years. But it wasn't working. Hispanic students lagged behind their peers in test scores, reading levels, and graduation rates. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our college-track courses were lily-white," Doluisio says. "Our remedial classes were filled with Puerto Rican kids. And the ability to speak English explained most of the difference." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What went wrong? <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio found out in a 1992 meeting with his district's elementary-school principals. The short answer: seven years. That's how long it was taking a typical student in the bilingual program to move into regular classes taught in English. Bethlehem had effectively established an English-second policy, thanks to educators who considered native-language training of primary importance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I was flabbergasted," Doluisio says. More than that, he was angry. And then he got busy. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Within a year, Doluisio led a stunning transformation of Bethlehem's language policy. His district became one of a handful in the country to reverse course on bilingual education. Today, Bethlehem's Spanish-speaking students are immersed in English-speaking classrooms, where they hear almost nothing but English. The school district switched policies only after a bitter struggle had divided the community along racial and ethnic lines. But thanks to Doluisio's leadership, the benefits of English immersion are starting to show, and the naysayers are starting to change their minds. Today, Bethlehem provides a stirring example of how other school districts can challenge the bilingual-education orthodoxy -- and win. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since 1968, the federal government has spent nearly $4 billion on bilingual education. In 1995 alone, it spent $206 million. (President Clinton wanted to increase the annual appropriation to $300 million, but was halted by the budget crunch and House Republicans.) But federal money has been less important than federal power to the consolidation of bilingual education. During the 1970s and 1980s, bureaucrats in the U.S. Department of Education coerced hundreds of school districts around the country into adopting native-language instruction for their non-English-speaking students. They based their tactics on a 1974 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right for non-English-speaking children to receive some sort of special language assistance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Court did not prescribe a particular pedagogical approach, but its federal enforcers did. Through a confusing array of regulations, court orders, and consent decrees, they insisted that school districts provide a curriculum with a heavy emphasis on the students' native tongues. In this political climate, Bethlehem's program was born. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Bethlehem Area School District, serving 13,000 children, is Pennsylvania's fifth-largest. About 10 percent of its students cannot speak English well, and of these, 86 percent speak Spanish in their homes. Most of these children are Puerto Rican, but immigrants from Central and South America make up a growing part of the Spanish-speaking population.  <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before the 1993-94 school year, Bethlehem was fully committed to bilingual education and its goal of teaching students in their native language before they moved into regular classrooms. English-speakers and immigrant children who didn't speak Spanish attended their neighborhood schools. But the school district essentially segregated its Spanish-speaking students, busing them to two elementary schools. There was little time for English at these segregated schools. Spanish was the language of the classroom, the lunchroom, and the playground. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most bilingual educators say that native-language instruction is the surest road to English fluency, since it makes for an easier transition. But Doluisio believes this defies common sense. "You can't teach kids how to swim by giving them a lecture at the side of the pool," he says. "They've got to get wet, and maybe even take in a little bit of water. Our job as educators is to keep them afloat, to make sure they don't go under." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After learning about bilingual education's dismal exit rates in Bethlehem, Doluisio began to investigate the program more intently. He quickly uncovered more outrages. "There were kindergartners -- five-year-olds who were at the perfect age to start learning a new language -- who did not hear a single word of English all day long," says Doluisio. "I probably should have known that this sort of thing was going on, but nobody told me. I had to discover it for myself." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The more he learned, the less he liked. "I really believe in my heart that we were hurting these kids," he says. "I started to see a connection between bilingual education and Latino dropout rates. Not a total connection, to be sure. But definitely a connection." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As soon as Doluisio decided that bilingual education was a problem, he set out to find a solution. He asked the district's bilingual-education director to assemble a committee to study the issue. But the majority of its members were advocates of the status quo. When it reported back to the school board in the fall of 1992, the committee said that the bilingual program was healthy and even suggested expanding it. Doluisio flew into a rage. "For the first time in my career, I rejected a report that had come out of my own administration," he says. 	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The superintendent launched a personal crusade against complacency. He studied the literature on bilingual education carefully. "I soon learned that in this field you can find research to back up just about any political point you want to make," he says, "especially if you support bilingual education." But some of the scholarship raised significant doubts.  <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rosalie Pedalino Porter's scathing expose, <I>Forked Tongue: The Politics of Bilingual Education</I> (1990), particularly influenced him. In this book, Porter draws upon her 15 years of experience as a bilingual-education teacher and administrator in Massachusetts. "I came to feel that I was going about things the wrong way around, as if I were deliberately holding back the learning of English," she writes. Porter is a strong proponent of "time on task," the idea that the amount of time spent learning something is the best predictor of educational achievement. In other words, students must practice English constantly if they are to learn it well. "Nothing in my 15 years in this field -- from first-hand classroom experience to concentrated research -- has begun to convince me that delaying instruction in English for several years will lead to <I>better</I> learning of English and to a greater ability to study subject matter taught in English," writes Porter, who now heads the READ Institute in Amherst, Massachusetts. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio examined this and other research, and decided that Bethlehem's language policy needed a complete overhaul. He convinced the school board to schedule a series of public meetings devoted to bilingual education  -- and to discuss its possible repeal. Community interest was so great that the board had to hold its gatherings in the Liberty High School auditorium, the district's largest. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue immediately split along ethnic lines. Many Latino parents felt that the removal of bilingual education would jeopardize their children's education. Some of Doluisio's supporters undercut him when they stepped up to the microphone and made derogatory comments about Puerto Ricans. "These meetings were very heated," Doluisio recalls. "They were very emotional. I had to have cops in the back of the room to make sure that there was no trouble." At one point, a group of Latino activists physically surrounded the school board and, led by a priest from out of town, engaged in a prayer to save Bethlehem's bilingual-education program. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Pennsylvania Department of Education also frowned on Doluisio's efforts. Myrna Delgado, the state's bilingual-education coordinator, urged the school board to vote against the superintendent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The rancor of the hearings weighed heavily on Doluisio, especially the ugly way in which race and ethnicity intruded. It appeared that all the Latinos were on one side, all the Anglos on the other. "This was an extremely unpleasant time for me, and for everybody," says Doluisio. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About midway through the controversy, however, a group of sympathetic Hispanic parents contacted him. They were professionals, led by Luis A. Ramos of Pennsylvania Power and Light. "We hoped to make it clear that Latinos want their children to learn English, and that the superintendent was heading in the right direction," says Ramos, whose two children have attended Bethlehem schools. "Their support really gave me the courage to forge ahead," says Doluisio. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In February 1993, the school board voted to abolish bilingual education and adopt a district-wide plan for English immersion. The board clearly stated its goal that "all language-minority students in the district become fluent in the English language in the shortest amount of time possible to maximize their opportunity to succeed in school." All students, including Spanish-speaking children, would attend neighborhood schools, and students who required special help would receive instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL) several times a week. Spanish-speaking kids would spend the bulk of their time in regular classrooms listening to teachers who, in most cases, spoke virtually no Spanish. "It was our belief that if the Chinese and Russian kids could do well in a regular classroom without bilingual education, then so could the Spanish-speakers," says Rebecca Bartholomew, the principal of Lincoln Elementary. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Lincoln was one of several schools that suddenly had to confront a sizable population of students who did not speak English very well. The school board insisted that the immersion program be in place by the following September, leaving just seven months to implement a completely new plan for teaching children with limited English skills. The move upset bilingual teachers, who believed wholeheartedly in the theory of native-language maintenance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But immersion met with resistance from non-bilingual teachers as well. They were accustomed to dealing with children who would understand their most basic instructions. "In the first week of the new program, we had homeroom teachers who would tell their class to line up, and half the class wouldn't understand," says Ann Goldberg, who runs the immersion program for Bethlehem. "It was really tough going at first." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"A lot of regular classroom teachers felt really incompetent, since the switch to immersion was so rapid and so complete," said Carole Schachter, an ESL teacher who had previously taught in the bilingual program. "They could barely communicate with many of their students," she said. A number of teachers remain critical of the switch and of Doluisio, but they prefer anonymity. The school district will publish its first academic evaluation of the program this summer, and the results are sure to be watched closely by educators both inside and outside of Bethlehem. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Hispanic parents are gradually beginning to approve of the new policy. One who likes the switch to English immersion is Margarita Rivas. A native of Puerto Rico, she was concerned at first that her four children would not succeed in school if they did not hear much Spanish. But then she changed her mind. "It's very important that they know how to speak English well in this country," she says. "Now they speak English better than Spanish, and they are helping me and my husband improve our English." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the immersion program had been in place for one year, Bethlehem surveyed the parents of its Spanish-speaking students. The forms went out in two languages, since many of the parents speak no English. The results were remarkably positive. Eighty-one percent of the respondents said that their children had "progressed well academically" in the English-immersion setting. Only 7 percent said that they "did not make progress." Another 82 percent rated the new program as "good" or "very good," 12 percent called it "adequate" or "satisfactory," and only 1 percent deemed it "poor." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The approval ratings appear to remain high today. "My daughter is getting a good education here," Sayda Castaneda, an immigrant from Honduras, says through a translator. "I don't want my daughter to forget her first language, but English is spoken in the United States." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The teachers have started to come around as well. "I was against immersion in the beginning, but I'm not nearly as critical now," says Jean Walker, a 4th-grade teacher who has taught in Bethlehem schools for 24 years. "I didn't think I'd be able to communicate, but these kids learned English faster than I thought they would. I like immersion now. It's not perfect, but I like it," she says. A survey shows that Walker is not alone -- 62 percent of Bethlehem teachers say that students were making "substantial progress" in learning English after being in the program for one year. Only 13 percent said students made "little" or "no" progress. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rita Hatton, a Cuban-born teacher with 20 years' experience in Bethlehem, still has some reservations about immersion. A veteran of the bilingual program and now an ESL teacher at Freemansburg Elementary, she worries that her children will lose their Spanish fluency. But she also sees rapid gains among her students learning English. "At the start of the school year, some of them only spoke two or three words of English," she says. "Now they can speak it, read it, and write it pretty well." In fact, English is by far the predominant language in her classroom. Donna West, an ESL teacher, came to Bethlehem after it adopted the immersion program, but she had taught previously for six years in a Brownsville, Texas, bilingual program. "I like the immersion model much better," she says. "In Brownsville, the kids simply weren't becoming proficient in English. They started a lot of kids in Spanish, but they need English when they're young." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio was officially condemned at the 1994 convention of the National Association for Bilingual Education. His detractors accuse him of being driven by politics, even of riding a tide of anti-immigrant sentiment. He says his goal is to help immigrants succeed by raising expectations for their performance. "For years we expected our Latino kids to learn differently. We didn't think they could cut it in mainstream classes with the native English speakers or the kids from Asia or Poland," says Doluisio. "The results were like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Today we're saying that Latino kids are just as capable as any other group of students." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 &#160; &#160;<center><h2>Micro Wave</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>
</b></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With its frigid winters, rocky soil, and lack of mineral wealth, New England was an unlikely center of economic dynamism in the early American republic. But the Unitarians of Massachusetts, Baptists of Rhode Island, and Congregationalists of Connecticut boasted an asset more precious than tobacco or gold: an industrious, courageous, imaginative population that created opportunity in the most surprising places.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If New England had no resources, its intrepid sailors would find them elsewhere. Salem became the spice entrepot of the world, New Bedford the whaling capital. New Englanders even found ways to make money from the cold, mining and transporting ice to China and the East Indies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A visionary in the New England tradition is creating opportunity where most people see only hopeless poverty: the inner city. Jeffrey Ashe started Working Capital in 1990 to provide small loans to borrowers cut off from commercial banking: home-based and storefront businesses in poor urban and rural areas. Since then, this nonprofit, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has financed and trained more than 2,200 micro-businesses in New England, Delaware, and Florida. Its loans now total more than $2 million.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"We practice reverse redlining," says Ashe. "We lend in areas where commercial banks usually won't go, and at amounts too low for commercial lenders to justify the paperwork." Loans from Working Capital start at $500 and rise to $5,000, versus the typical commercial minimum of $25,000 to $50,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Working Capital doesn't check the credit of its borrowers, nor does it ask for collateral. And yet, despite lending in inner cities, the program has an astonishingly low write-off rate of 2 percent, and only 6 percent of its borrowers are behind in their payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ashe reduces credit risk through an ingenious idea called "peer-group lending." Five to 10 business owners seeking loans come together and agree to provide a kind of social collateral for each other's debts. Working Capital will give new loans to group members only if all the loans from their peers are up to date. Borrowers therefore press each other to make their loan payments on time. This gives all the members an incentive to help each other find customers. And borrowers will join groups only with others of good character. Says Ashe: "People size each other up on the basis of trust."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"We become family," says Leonor Sanchez, who runs an export-import business in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and has been with a group for three years. To keep their group together, Sanchez and her peers have made payments on three occasions when a member was at risk of defaulting. In another case, a borrower had to sell her equipment to pay off her loan, and the group helped find a purchaser. Fellow members of Sanchez's group include an auto body shop, a bakery, a home-based TV and VCR repair shop, an Avon saleswoman, and several vendors of clothing and jewelry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The approach seems to work in a variety of settings. Lawrence, one of New England's poorest cities, has 32 active lending groups, consisting mainly of Hispanic immigrants. Vermont has a successful Working Capital program for rural entrepreneurs. And a new program in Delaware, run by the New Castle County YWCA, concentrates on African-Americans. In its first year, according to program director Mary Dupont, it has given 105 loans with a repayment rate of 100 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lending groups were pioneered by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which has given micro-loans to two million peasant women. Ashe became familiar with the idea in the 1970s and 1980s while working with Accion International, a micro-lender in Latin America. Leading U.S. programs include the Women's Self-Employment Project, run by Chicago's South Shore Bank; the Rural Economic Development Center, in North Carolina; and an Accion International program in the Southwest. According to Margaret Clark, a micro-lending specialist at the Aspen Institute, "this is one of the few minority business-development strategies that delivers what it promises."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Working Capital is still America's largest peer-group lender, and Ashe is looking for partners in new cities. He also aims to reduce the program's costs so that Working Capital can break even in five years. "We'll be able to create even more jobs," he says, "when we become self-sustaining."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Peer lending has so far attracted more attention on the Left than on the Right. Working Capital takes government funding as well as money from the left-wing MacArthur Foundation, and the idea is a favorite of Hillary Clinton's. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Jeffrey Ashe's social capitalism merits a closer look by conservatives. His themes, after all, include escaping poverty through entrepreneurship, honoring one's debts, fostering community self-help, and making a profit. Asked how the private sector could help, Ashe says: "Invest in our programs. We'll pay you back in 10 years, and you will have helped create thousands of new jobs in some of America's poorest communities."

<H2>A Wet Blanket for Volunteer Firefighters</h2><br>
<center><b>by John P. Walters</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<font size="+1">L</font>ast summer, a brush fire in West Hampton, New York, burned for more than two weeks, consuming 5,000 acres and 12 homes. Several thousand volunteer firemen from 192 fire departments risked their lives to battle the blaze. According to the Clinton administration, many of them also broke the law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Volunteer fire departments are pillars of suburban and rural life. About 1.2 million of America's 1.5 million firemen and rescue workers are volunteers, and they staff more than 21,000 firehouses across the land. Until recently, many of them were professional firemen who donated their expertise and time to volunteer companies based in their local communities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Clinton administration, however, has erected a fire wall between volunteer and professional firefighting. The Labor Department ruled in 1993 that firefighters employed by government are barred from offering their services gratis in their own communities. They risk fines and even the loss of their jobs for what the government has deemed a crime: volunteering to protect their own homes and neighbors. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 1993 ruling came in response to complaints by paid firemen in Montgomery County, Maryland, that they lost overtime wages when other firemen volunteered in their spare time. Prodded by the International Association of Firefighters (an AFL-CIO affiliate), the Labor Department decreed that municipalities and counties must pay overtime to volunteers who are also full-time paid firemen and rescue workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The logic of the department's decision threatens to undermine all voluntary activity by public employees. Reinterpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act, which prohibits paid employees from volunteering similar services to the same employer, the agency ruled that Montgomery County firemen could not volunteer in independent, privately run firehouses because their "employer," the county and its citizens, were the ultimate beneficiaries of such services. So the county was forced to pay for the services it received. Under the same reasoning, public-school teachers could not be volunteer tutors in their spare time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Underfinanced and wary of lawsuits claiming years of back pay for overtime, volunteer firehouses acted predictably: They stopped allowing professional firefighters to volunteer. As a result, in Montgomery County alone, nearly 200 men and women could no longer offer their services without pay at the county's 38 private, independent firehouses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ruling, which allows professional firemen to volunteer only outside the county or city that employs them, has had ramifications far beyond Montgomery County. When the City of St. Cloud, Minnesota, merged with the surrounding Township of St. Cloud, the city's professional firehouse also merged with the township's all-volunteer operation, creating one jurisdiction where there previously had been two. The City of St. Cloud, fearful of liability for overtime pay and pressured by the union, forced its firefighters to choose between working for the city and volunteering. Not surprisingly, they chose their jobs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides limiting the individual freedom of firefighters, this ruling threatens public safety. Volunteer fire companies generally serve communities too small to afford paid, full-time fire and rescue squads. Many professional firemen get their start in volunteer companies, and in turn they provide these squads with valuable skills and training. But thanks to the Clinton administration, seasoned, motivated volunteers are now lost once they "go pro." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The new regulation also drives up local government costs, thereby forcing higher tax rates. Like so many private institutions that duplicate services provided by government, volunteer fire departments do more with less. While New York City spends over $1 million a year to run a firehouse, its volunteer departments provide the same service for about $45,000 -- the average salary of a single city firefighter. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But perhaps most disturbing, the Clinton administration is undermining civic responsibility. Volunteer firehouses are multipurpose town halls, centers of community life for volunteers and ordinary citizens alike. Volunteering at the firehouse is a tradition passed down through families, anchoring them in the community and providing role models of civic leadership for generations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With the support of the National Volunteer Fire Council, Virginia congressman Herbert H. Bateman has introduced legislation to correct the Labor Department's abuse of federal power. The Volunteer Firefighter and Rescue Squad Worker Protection Act would exempt paid firefighters and rescue workers from the FLSA overtime requirements if they volunteer their off-duty services at locations in their communities where they are not employed. The legislation would allow these volunteers to sign a waiver legally relinquishing their rights to overtime compensation under the act. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress will soon host its annual Fire and Emergency Services dinner, a huge gala honoring the emergency-services community and the members of Congress who support it. The brave men and women who battled the brush fire at West Hampton last summer will be singled out for their service. Standing among them will be many who broke the law by volunteering. Will they receive plaudits or pink-slips? Stay tuned.

<center><h2>Quotas in the Drug War</h2><br>
<b>by Greg Forster</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<font size="+1">A</font> 1992 drug bust by Los Angeles police and federal agents began as a routine undercover operation. Police made eight visits to a dealer's motel room, buying a total of 133 grams of crack cocaine. In the raid they seized firearms and arrested five men, charging them with drug trafficking. Because of the amounts of cocaine and the weapons involved, prosecutors  indicted the men in federal court, where sentences are generally stiffer than in state courts.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So far, nothing unusual. Last year, 9,877 drug-trafficking cases were filed in federal courts. The L.A. bust was virtually a text-book case for the prosecution of cocaine dealers polluting neighborhoods with drugs and violence.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But then the NAACP and the ACLU added a new twist to the story: a claim of racial discrimination. The final chapter is now being written in the Supreme Court, which will soon decide how and when defense lawyers can play the race card in drug cases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All the defendants in the 1992 case are black, as are most crack defendants in federal courts. Barbara O'Connor, a federal public defender, claims the government is targeting black defendants for prosecution in federal courts, instead of more lenient state courts, because of their race. O'Connor's client, Shelton Martin (a.k.a. "Psycho"), faces 35 years to life in federal prison; in the California state system, he would face only three to 10 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With legal support from the NAACP and ACLU, O'Connor convinced federal judge Consuelo Marshall to order prosecutors to explain why they decided to charge the men in federal court. The prosecutors appealed the order to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against them. The Justice Department then appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments last February.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In <I>United States v. Armstrong</I>, the Court will decide not whether prosecutors discriminated against blacks, but under what circumstances prosecutors must account for the high proportion of blacks being charged with crack-cocaine trafficking in federal court. To be sure, there is a large statistical disparity between blacks and whites facing drug charges in federal court. According to prosecutors, 74.6 percent of the crack cases filed in the central California federal district from January 1992 through March 1995 were filed against blacks. Only one was filed against a white.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Does it suggest discrimination?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"It is undisputed that the manufacture and wholesale distribution of crack is concentrated in the inner city and is dominated by inner-city street gangs," says U.S. Attorney Nora Manella of California's Central District, which prosecuted the defendants in <I>Armstrong</I>. And it's no secret that the gangs who dominate the crack market, like the neighborhoods they prey on, are disproportionately minority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our job isn't to set racial quotas," Manella says. "Our job is to pursue criminal activity and then let the chips fall where they may."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the Supreme Court rules for the defense, it would force prosecutors to spend thousands of hours responding to frivolous claims, Manella says.  Since the Ninth Circuit ruling, more than a hundred defendants have sued for discrimination.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	An adverse ruling by the Court could also make prosecutors more concerned with eliminating statistical disparities than punishing drug dealers. That's law enforcement by quota, and it's the last thing our inner cities need, especially those residents hit hardest by crime: blacks and other minorities. Over half of all 1994 murder victims  were black, for example, while blacks make up only 12 percent of the population.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"If we want to address disparities," says Reuben Greenberg, the black police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, "let's address disparities that really matter -- like whether people live or die."

<h2>Drumbeats for Divorce Reform</h2></a>
&#160; &#160; &#160;<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
</center>
<p>
<b>Lighting the Match</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	On September 5, 1969, with a stroke of his pen, California governor Ronald Reagan wiped out the moral basis for marriage in America.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Within five years, 44 states had followed California's lead in instituting some form of no-fault divorce reform. (Oklahoma and Maryland already had no-fault laws on the books, but the Golden State is credited with igniting a national wildfire.) Today, every state in the nation permits at least one of two no-fault mechanisms for dissolving a marriage: (1) one or both spouses can sue for divorce because of "incompatibility," "irreconcilable differences," or "irretrievable breakdown of the marriage"; (2) a couple can request a divorce after obtaining a legal separation and waiting a certain period of time. No longer must a spouse prove cruelty, desertion, or adultery, the traditional grounds for divorce.<P>
<img src="home.gif" align=center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At the time, such legislation seemed humane and enlightened. It was hailed as an overdue reform of a wink-wink, nudge-nudge system rife with hypocrisy and lurid accusations. Under the fault-based system, the suing partner had to prove the fault of the other and show themselves to be blameless; otherwise their respective culpability canceled each other's claims. Because the assessment of guilt determined the division of assets between spouses, the stakes were high. Even when both partners desired the divorce, they were often reduced to perjury and collusion, sometimes staging "adulterous liaisons" to be captured in grainy photographs by lurking private eyes. And the definition of cruelty in a marriage was stretched to ludicrous lengths.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Although attorneys and women's-rights advocates argued vigorously for reform, most Americans disagreed. In 1968, just before the wave of no-fault reforms, less than 20 percent of the general public wanted to make divorce easier, and nearly two-thirds wanted to make divorce laws even stricter.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It turns out that the public's instincts were right. With the advent of widespread no-fault divorce, the United States saw a dramatic surge in the number of divorces granted each year. In 1960, 16 percent of first marriages ended in divorce; today, the figure is closer to 50 percent. In the five years following the enactment of no-fault in California, the national divorce rate increased almost 40 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The causal connection between the unravelling of divorce laws and the unravelling of marriages is admittedly debatable. But it seems clear that the states' drive to make divorce more humane inadvertently denuded marriage of any meaning. In her forthcoming book, <I>The Abolition of Marriage: How We Destroy Lasting Love</I>, <a href="#maggie">Maggie Gallagher</a>, a scholar with the Institute for American Values, writes, "From a formal, legal standpoint, marriage is no longer an enforceable commitment." With no-fault divorce, wrote David Wagner in a paper for the Family Research Council, "marriage becomes nothing more than notarized dating."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	 Last year in <I>National Review</I>, Robert Plunkett, the vice dean of the Southern California Institute of Law, eloquently described the legal case against no-fault divorce: "The wedding vow has devolved from being the most serious and solemn oath a typical person ever made into being less than a contract. An oral contract made with a two-year-old is more binding than the contract of marriage; it at least binds one party, the adult. A marriage contract is binding on no one."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Equally clear is the harm to innocent parties under the no-fault regime: They have been stripped of their legal protection. Even when one spouse desperately wants to keep the marriage together, he or she has no legal recourse, and may have to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees for an unwanted divorce. All the power belongs to the initiator.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to its unintended consequences, no-fault divorce hasn't necessarily fulfilled its goal of attenuating the acrimony of divorce proceedings; the conflict has merely shifted from the allocation of blame to conflicts over child custody and division of property. It still gets ugly when families break apart. In divorce, the scarlet letter no longer stands for adultery -- it now can refer to malicious accusations of child sexual abuse. <p><b>Repairing the Damage</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the moral consequences of America's soaring divorce rate have become clear, even leading Democrats are voicing their support for stricter divorce laws. In her syndicated newspaper column, for instance, First Lady Hillary Clinton recently wrote, "I think getting a divorce should be much harder when children are involved. . . . Divorce has become too easy because of our permissive laws and attitudes." She goes on to say, "The good news is that attitudes about marriage and divorce seem to be changing. Some states are beginning to examine whether their divorce laws are too lax. Grass-roots campaigns to help preserve marriage are flourishing around the country."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	William A. Galston, a professor at the University of Maryland and a former domestic policy advisor to President Clinton, offered a more concrete view in a <I>New York Times</I> editorial last December: "For couples with dependent children, we should eliminate unilateral no-fault -- where one person can readily obtain a divorce without the other's consent -- and return to an updated fault-based system, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. And even in cases where both parties consent, there should be suitable braking mechanisms: a mandatory pause of at least a year for reflection, counseling and mediation."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although prominent liberals are joining the rhetorical battle, Christian and other conservative family groups and lawmakers are leading the policy debates within state legislatures: 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Michigan.</b> State representative Jessie Dalman has put forth a package of marriage and divorce reforms, most notably abolishing unilateral no-fault divorce -- whether or not children are involved. Her plan would still allow no-fault if both parties agree to the divorce, but if one party objects, the person filing would need to demonstrate fault -- namely adultery, desertion, physical or mental abuse, drug or alcohol addiction, or incarceration for more than three years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Dalman also wants to encourage premarital counseling for marriage-license applicants, improve enforcement of child support, and require couples with children to receive divorce counseling before filing for divorce and to submit a "parenting plan" to the court. The bill, vigorously supported by Republican governor John Engler, is scheduled for a vote in late April.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Michigan Family Forum, a nonprofit research group in Lansing, laid the intellectual groundwork for the legislation. It recently published "Breaking up Is Easy To Do," a short but useful guide to the history of divorce reform in Michigan and across the nation. Full of statistics and references to important resources, it's a great tool for educating activists and lawmakers.
<p><I>The Michigan Family Forum can be reached at 517-374-1171. </I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Idaho.</b> Representative Tom Dorr has introduced The Justice in Family Law Act, which would require mutual consent in all divorces filed on grounds of irreconcilable differences -- most states' version of no-fault divorce -- whether or not children are present. Because Idaho does not recognize legal separation, however, critics voiced concern about spouses caught in abusive relationships. Dorr has added a bill that establishes legal separation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although both bills are expected to die in committee this session, they will probably become a top conservative caucus issue for the 1997 session.
<P><I>For information, call Dennis Mansfield, the executive director of the Idaho Family Forum, at 208-376-9009.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Georgia.</b> Representative Brian Joyce's bill to remove "irretrievable breakdown" as grounds for divorce was killed in committee this March, but he intends to introduce it again next year. (No-fault would still be permissible if both parties agreed and no minor children were involved.) After talking with representatives from the Georgia chapter of the National Organization for Women, Joyce added provisions that would allow a unilateral no-fault divorce for spouses involved in physically abusive marriages. 
<p><I>Brian Joyce can be reached at 404-656-0265.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Iowa.</b> Despite the support of Republican governor Terry Branstad, a bill similar to Michigan's  was killed in the house in March. Lawmakers vow to reintroduce the legislation next year. 	
<P>
<I>For more information, contact state representatives Charles Hurley and Danny Carroll at  515-281-3221</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Colorado.</b> Although no divorce-reform legislation is now in the pipeline, just watch. Tom McMillen is executive director of the Rocky Mountain Family Council, a politically savvy think tank that has helped to devise a three-year plan: in the first year, educate the public on the ill effects of divorce; in the second, work with churches to develop community marriage policies to support existing marriages; in the third, introduce legislation. <p>
<I>Tom McMillen can be reached at 303-456-9285.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Legislatures in several other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Indiana, and Kansas, are considering reforms of no-fault divorce this year, but these are given little chance of passing. Earlier this year, pro-family legislators in Virginia tried to pass a law to prevent unilateral no-fault divorce when children are present. It was shot down quickly in committee.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Still, the issue is here to stay. Larry Huff of the Family Research Council reports that more bills are expected to be introduced next year in Maine, Washington, and several other states. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows that more than half of all Americans think that divorce should be more difficult; support for reform is especially strong among adults under the age of 30 -- the generation that suffered widespread divorce as children.<p><b>Fallout Shelters</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When mothers and fathers decide to divorce, their children get caught in the litigation crossfire. In order to shield these youngest of victims and to reduce the caseload of post-divorce litigation, family-court lawyers and judges across the country are now mandating that couples seeking a divorce first learn how their decision affects their children.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One of the largest and most widely emulated programs can be found in Cobb County, Georgia, where parents must complete a four-hour seminar within 31 days of filing for divorce. Operated by a nonprofit social-service agency called Families First, the seminar teaches parents how to tell their children about their decision and how to ease the disruption and sense of loss that divorce brings to children.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
Since 1988, the program, known as "Children Cope with Divorce: Seminar for Divorcing Parents," has taught ex-spouses how to handle visitation and parenting issues and avoid using the children as messengers or weapons. The $30 fee can be waived for those who cannot afford it, but the program is mandatory.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a good reason for that: Court administrators and judges have found that when such education programs are voluntary, parents rarely attend. Their daily lives are already collapsing, and they seldom see the need for any outside counseling. Family law officials also have found that the attendance of both parents is vital. If only one parent learns about the effects of divorce on the kids, he or she is usually willing to concede more in order to protect the children -- a distinct disadvantage in negotiation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although parents are often reluctant or openly resentful when they begin, more than 95 percent leave the program feeling it was useful and that it will improve their behavior. And that's not just talk. In Cobb County, the rate of court appearances for post-divorce litigation such as custody and support has dropped to 15 percent of divorcing couples.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Other programs boast similar results. Before Jefferson County, Kentucky, established its Families in Transition program, one in three families found itself back in court within a year fighting over child-related issues. After the mandated program began, the rate dropped to 10 percent. Many jurisdictions without a similar program report a rate of 25 to 35 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Children Cope with Divorce" curriculum has been exported to other jurisdictions in Georgia and around the country, and counselors and court officials from all over the United States and Canada are going to Families First's offices to learn the program.

<b>The Abolition of Marriage</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maggie Gallagher, an affiliate scholar at the Institute for American Values, says in her upcoming book <I>The Abolition of Marriage</I> that we have falsely framed the divorce debate as "one between choice and coercion, individual liberty and state control. . . . The bad marriage haunts us in part because we have reduced the marriage commitment to a single, grim, frightening phrase: Couples should 'stay together for the sake of the children.' The vision it conjures -- of loveless, bitter, tight-lipped martyrs living in hell with their equally miserable kids -- is impossible to uphold as a moral ideal. . . ."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"'You can't force two people to stay married,' we tell ourselves and turn the page," she writes. "Divorce, however, is not usually the act of a couple, but of an individual. Eighty percent of divorces in this country are unilateral, rather than truly mutual, decisions. Rather, the divorce revolution can be more accurately described as a shift of power, favoring the interests of one party over others: the interests of the spouse who wishes to leave over those of the spouse who is being abandoned and over those of the children whose consent is not sought."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Her research about the state of marriage leads her to conclude, "Reforming no-fault divorce is more than a tactical necessity. Simple decency requires that the law retreat from relentlessly favoring the spouse who leaves in no-fault divorces and place some minimal power back into the hands of the spouse who is being left. Imposing a five- to seven-year waiting period for contested no-fault divorces (as do many European jurisdictions) would serve the ends of both justice and prudence: raising the number of marriages that ultimately succeed, while at the very least ensuring that those who want a quick and easy divorce will have to negotiate with their marriage partner in order to get it."
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<h2>Mum's the Word in British Day Care</h2>
<b>by George W. Liebmann</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1961, a mother in London wrote a letter to the Manchester <I>Guardian</I> that resonated with families all over Britain. Belle Tutaev related her predicament as a working mother of limited means who wanted to spend more time with her young daughter and also wanted a safe learning environment for her child while she was at work. She described how she and her friends had set up a "playgroup" in her neighborhood, in which mothers working part-time took turns supervising and providing a structure of educational games for each other's children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tutaev's letter inspired an overwhelming response from mothers wanting to know how to set up similar playgroups. So, after borrowing a typewriter and setting up a duplicator in her garage, Tutaev created an educational charity to give practical guidance to British mothers. Today the Pre-school Learning Alliance helps organize 20,000 playgroups for 800,000 British children ages three to five, including more than 40 percent of the country's three- and four-year-olds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The typical British playgroup has 40 children, with a supervisor (usually paid) and two or three volunteer mothers (or other relatives) at all times. Parents usually serve in rotation for half a day every week. Most children attend playgroups for two or three half-day sessions per week, though a growing number of playgroups offer extended hours for working mothers. The typical playgroup rents space from a neighborhood church or other community institution within walking distance of the childrens' homes. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The active participation of volunteer mothers keeps costs low. Fees per child typically run less than half the cost of nursery schools. But the real benefit of parental involvement is educational. "Our evidence," says Lady Plowden, a former president of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, shows that "it is generally undesirable to separate mother and child for a whole day in the nursery." According to the Alliance's official literature:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Children learn better when their parents are involved. Seeing their own families validated and powerful gives them a secure base from which to progress, and parents are in a better position to reinforce at home the learning which has occurred in the group . . . becom[ing] confident partners in the world of education rather than mere consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Netherlands and Ireland also have strong playgroup movements, and the idea is beginning to catch on in America. What is most distinctive about the British movement is the nationwide dissemination of practical information and curricula, so that parents forming a new group do not have to reinvent the wheel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Pre-school Learning Alliance puts out a monthly magazine, <I>Under Five Contact</I>, for member groups and parents, and has produced three television series on the organization and operation of playgroups. Its catalogue of publications includes session outlines, suggested rules, course materials, and workbooks for such "learning through play" activities as gluing, woodwork, wordplay, finger exercises, math, language, science, and music. Courses on playgroups are offered not only to group leaders but also to parents; 40,000 parents each year take them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like many British charities, the playgroup association has the imprimatur of the Crown. Diana, Princess of Wales, is the official patron of the Pre-school Learning Alliance. But the playgroup movement is otherwise a model of voluntary activity independent of the state. Individual playgroups raise their own money, mostly from fees from parents. And though playgroups in London are granted substantial subsidies from that city's government, British playgroups overall have received less than 5 percent of their revenue from taxpayers. All playgroups must register with government authorities, and meet certain regulatory standards under the Official Children Act. However, the standards of the Alliance are even higher than those of the government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Britain's Parliament is now considering pre-school vouchers for four-year-olds that could be used either at a playgroup or at a nursery school. But since parents would decide which playgroup to attend, the playgroups could still maintain their independence from government control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The British playgroup movement is an attractive model for American parents looking for an alternative both to institutionalized day care and to nursery school for three- and four-year-olds. One of the most important attractions is the opportunity for parents to be more involved with their children and with friends in the neighborhood. In addition, the British model also offers a wealth of experience and model practices, so that parents can learn from the successes and mistakes of those who have gone before.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h2>Opus Dei Tutors Kids in Aquinas and Algebra</h2>
<center><b>by John W. Kennedy</b>
<p><p><P></center>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
	For most of its 30 years, Chicago's Midtown Education Foundation (MEF) has bucked prevailing currents in American culture. When young people in the 1960s began to rage against authority and social norms, Midtown's academic tutoring program emphasized moral decisionmaking. As religious values came under attack as never before, Midtown made faith in God indispensable to its educational message.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Times have changed. Virtues such as discipline, sacrifice, and honesty are coming back in vogue. "This is our moment," says Jim Palos, the executive director. "People are finally realizing the worth of teaching values."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Midtown operates two educational centers for inner-city children from fourth through 12th grade. Through after-school tutoring in academics and workshops in character-building, it aims to save students left behind in a public-school system that sees 42 percent of its high-school students drop out every year. Midtown seeks not only to catch these kids but to propel them toward higher education, productive careers, and responsible adulthood. "We want these kids to be changed, so that in 20 years they'll be faithful, loving spouses and good, reliable employees," Palos says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Almost all of Midtown's graduates finish high school, and most go on to college. Typical of the center's successes is Ricardo Blasquez, who grew up in a struggling neighborhood in Chicago in the 1960s. Blasquez, who later served as a mentor himself at Midtown, now is the managing director of 10 General Motors plants in Mexico and California. He says MEF staff and volunteers became "like family at a critical time for all of us." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	MEF began as an outreach of Members of Opus Dei (Latin for "work of God"), a movement of Catholic laymen determined to integrate their faith with daily work, social activity, and family life. Although all 18 MEF staff members are Catholic, they seek to promote not church doctrine but rather a broad Christian ethic. The foundation's 465 volunteer mentors -- one for each child in the program -- are Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, even agnostic. But they share a common core of moral principles, based on the Bible and on natural law, which they try to transmit to the children.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Giving character education to children without talking to them about God is like trying to build a house without a foundation," says Patricia Cronin, who developed a character-education curriculum for the program's mentors. "We want children to make moral commitments, not just to please adults or to conform to social customs that evolve out of convenience or pleasure, but to satisfy their own deep needs for order and relatedness."<p><b>Targeting average kids</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is not only the most troubled children -- the adolescent pimps, prostitutes, and drug dealers -- who need moral education, Midtown officials argue. They do not seek out such children, and regard other organizations as better suited to handle their rehabilitation. Likewise, gifted students from strong families can find specialized programs elsewhere.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We target average kids," Palos says. "They're capable of returning a great deal to society, but often they're a neglected group. If you can have a consistent, comprehensive, and cogent culture, kids can overcome a bad school or home environment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 34-year-old Palos speaks from experience. He grew up in a Chicago neighborhood where drive-by shootings occurred regularly. He did not know that a world beyond such lawlessness existed until he enrolled in Midtown as a fifth-grader. "I didn't have any motivation to get good grades and I didn't want to be seen carrying books home from school," Palos recalls. "But then I met these interesting people at Midtown who were excited about learning." Palos enrolled in a Catholic high school, graduated from Columbia University, and became MEF's executive director four years ago.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although one purpose of MEF is to intervene before a boy is recruited by a gang or a girl becomes pregnant, the program's keystone is stimulating children to pursue education zealously. In Chicago, the odds against that are especially grim. Last year, the Illinois Goal Assessment Program gave statewide exams to its high schoolers; the Windy City was home to 45 of the 50 lowest-scoring schools. In February, Chicago school officials announced that the city was dropping the standardized Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, an admission that the city's public-school students cannot meet national standards.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Midtown encourages parents to send their children to one of about a dozen area schools, most of them parochial, geared toward college preparation. All MEF entrants are viewed as potential college graduates, even though two-thirds are from very low-income homes. Of those enrolled in the program, 95 percent graduate from high school, and 64 percent go on to college.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Admission to the center, which offers programs year-round, is not automatic. MEF gives all its applicants an academic achievement test, and also interviews their parents. "We don't admit a child unless the parent is behind him," Palos says. "We're not here to replace parents." MEF enrolled 1,531 students in 1995, double the number six years ago.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tuition for most ages is $100, although the actual per-pupil cost to the foundation is 10 times that amount. Ninety percent of MEF's $1.1 million budget comes from foundation grants or corporations such as Walgreens and Amoco, and about 3 percent from government sources. Midtown shuns public money for philosophical reasons -- government assistance can undercut religiously motivated programs -- but also on practical grounds: Public funding demands much more paperwork than private sources.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The academic regimen is straightforward. Elementary students attend two-hour classes one evening a week. That includes 60 minutes studying with a volunteer tutor, 15 minutes listening to a talk on values, and 45 minutes in recreational activities. An eight-week summer program offers daily activities. Outside the foundation's buildings on Peoria and Wood streets, the neighborhoods are gritty and foreboding. But the facilities inside are clean and brightly painted. Donated desks and chairs are in good shape. Hundreds of classic paperbacks are on classroom shelves. Students take home <I>Lord of the Rings</I>, <I>Swiss Family Robinson</I>, and <I>Where the Red Fern Grows</I> on the honor system. <P><B>Mentors and morality</B>

	While 90 percent of Midtown's students are African American or Hispanic, 90 percent of the volunteers are white. Most are successful professionals between 25 and 35, often living in the suburbs. All are determined to build bridges to inner-city kids.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At the boys' facility, many mentors arrive wearing suits and ties because they come directly from work. One evening it's Mike Brisson's turn to give the character-development talk on honesty. He speaks off the cuff, using the Socratic method to get students talking and thinking.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You might tell one little lie like 'I already did my homework,' but your mom notices your books haven't moved since you came home from school," Brisson says. "Then you say, 'I did it at school.' That's another lie." The boys are listening. "Telling the truth isn't always easy, but if we've done something wrong, it's better to accept the punishment," Brisson continues. "It's a bad habit to be sneaky. We owe the truth to ourselves, God, our parents, and teachers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Brisson, a computer programmer at a bank, mentors 11-year-old Eddie Calderon. Nowadays he's helping Eddie spend less time in front of the television and more time helping out around the house. Brisson phones Eddie weekly to strengthen the bond. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Amber Burnett, a 15-year-old attending Whitney Young High, one of the few decent public schools in the area, has been in the program for four years. Her goal for the week is to use more positive speech. "I have a habit of gossiping about what people wear," she says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To the mentors at Midtown -- in line with Catholic ethical teaching -- habits become either virtues or vices. They shape not only characters but ambitions as well.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amber has decided she wants to become an obstetrician. "She definitely will become a doctor," says her mother, Dorothy Burnett. "Have you seen her grades?" Burnett, a social services clerk at a church, just happens to be carrying a transcript in her pocketbook which shows an "A" in chemistry and a "B" in geometry.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Maricela Patino, a 14-year-old Catholic student, expects to major in engineering at college. Her parents -- dad is a butcher, mom is a school lunch server -- moved to Chicago 17 years ago from Mexico. According to Patricia Patino, Maricela's mother, MEF has been a godsend. "When I told her to help with the chores she wouldn't," she explains. She surreptitiously talked to the girl's counselor, who made subtle suggestions that took root. "Now, Maricela says, 'Mother, do you need help with something?'"  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Midtown program's basic approach -- Biblically based character development, taught by role models, and imbedded in an academic curriculum -- seems to be working. It clearly is in demand: Annual enrollment at MEF has increased by more than 13 percent every year over the last decade. But the Midtown program is no quick fix for delinquent youth. The best results, officials say, come from students who attend the program year after year. "Character isn't built in a couple of weeks," Palos says. "It takes time to break habits." <p>

<h2>The Market Approach to Job Training</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 presidential primaries have pushed the plight of American workers to the top of the nation's political agenda. Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and employees. Others say that inexorable economic and social trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All sides seem to agree that America must raise the educational level of its workers. But would-be reformers often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the education and training workers receive from their employers or in the private marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job. Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher wages.
<p><img src="bless2.gif" align=left><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>Training</I> magazine's annual survey of employee-training programs helps to clarify the issue. In 1995, about 50 million workers received some kind of formal training, up 25 percent since 1990. Employers spent more than $50 billion on formal training in 1995. Based on a ratio of formal to informal training documented in other studies, one can estimate that firms spent approximately $300 billion in informal training that same year, including the cost of supervision and lost-production time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly 90 percent of companies with more than 100 employees provided courses in management skills or basic computer skills. Many also taught skills in communication, supervising, and clerical work. While 70 percent of employers provided training for middle managers and executives, only about 40 percent did so for salespeople and production workers. Such workers are more likely, however, to receive informal, on-the-job training not included in these statistics.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why do companies train their employees? Workers who become more skilled in their jobs are more productive. Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more valuable at the firm where they were acquired.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One way to gauge the value of workplace training is to see how many workers needed some to qualify for the jobs they currently hold. A 1991 survey by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that 57 percent of workers said they needed training to qualify for their current jobs. About half of those workers learned such skills on the job. Another 21 percent received their training from formal company programs. Much smaller percentages said they obtained necessary skills from high school or post-secondary educational programs. Similarly, when BLS asked workers where they had received any training to improve skills, formal and informal company programs again accounted for about three-quarters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One interesting finding of the study was that many workers with college degrees earn less than workers without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training for their jobs. BLS economist Alan Eck wrote that company-provided training programs, particularly formal ones, "have more of an impact on increasing those workers' earnings than does any other source of training."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate training programs run the gamut from high-tech training centers to on-the-job instruction in word processing or operating machinery. Motorola, which makes cellular phones and paging gear, is often cited as a model for its variety of training programs. The company gives all employees at least 40 hours of training a year. Much of this training occurs at Motorola University, its $120-million, 14-branch teaching center.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1985, Motorola discovered that its employees lacked even the basic skills the fast-growing manufacturer needed. About 60 percent of its work force had trouble with seventh-grade math, necessary to track error rates, compute percentages, and solve other problems. Bob Galvin, then the chairman of the company, decided to devote at least 1.5 percent of payroll to training. (This has since risen to 4 percent.) All employees must have at least seventh-grade proficiency in math, and Motorola has even begun training its suppliers in statistical process control to reduce errors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Motorola's experience is not unusual. Forty-three percent of firms surveyed by <I>Training</I> magazine offered remedial education, defined in its broadest sense, including a host of academic skills. Limiting the definition just to reading, writing, arithmetic, and English as a second language, the magazine found that 22 percent of employers provided these services. That's an astounding number -- and 67 percent of those receiving remedial education are actually graduates of American high schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate training is an enormous enterprise that employs thousands of Americans. One company with a substantial investment in it is Manpower Inc., the largest temp agency in the United States. About one million people each year get job assignments from Manpower, and many of those workers go through a company-run program that provides training in technical and computer skills, communication, customer service, and quality control. Manpower also sells its training expertise directly to employers; almost 90 percent of <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies have called on Manpower to help train their employees. As of 1995, 500,000 workers in thousands of companies had benefited from Skillware, the company's computer-assisted training program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some companies pay the tuition for their employees to attend community colleges or night school. Other firms contract out their training needs to private trainers. Companies such as Berlitz International have long provided corporate training in such areas as foreign languages, money management, business communication, and computer software. I recently visited a new training company in Greensboro, North Carolina, that uses interactive computer systems to train local employees faster and cheaper than nearby colleges can. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Avco Financial Services, in Irvine, California, asked a local nonprofit literacy organization to help start an English-as-a-second-language program for its employees. The literacy council has trained dozens of Avco employees to serve as tutors for their English-language-deficient coworkers, many of whom are recent immigrants. While improving the language skills of many employees, the program has cost the company little. Both tutors and students work on language instruction on their own time. William Dudek, the president of a manufacturing firm in Chicago, created a similar English-instruction program as well as basic math classes for his employees. "We're not saints here," he says. "We're in business to make money. We just thought this was the best way to do it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate job training is not confined to higher-skill, higher-wage occupations. Carolinas Associated General Contractors, a trade association, offers classes in construction fundamentals, math, electrical work, plumbing, carpentry, sheet metal, and mechanical skills to prospective construction workers, because its members desperately need skilled individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On a much larger scale, McDonald's U.S.A. trains thousands of young people each year in its nearly 9,000 U.S. restaurants. "Sending a kid to the Army used to be the standard way to teach kids values, discipline, respect for authority, to be a member of a team, get to work on time, brush your teeth, comb your hair, clean your fingernails," says Edward H. Rensi, the firm's president and CEO. "Now, somehow, McDonald's has become the new entry-level job-training institution in America. We find ourselves doing things in that role that we would never have imagined we would do." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, companies must subject training expenses to a rigorous cost-benefit test. The 1995 <I>Training</I> magazine survey found that business managers scrutinize training expenses to evaluate their impact on productivity. Almost two-thirds of the employers surveyed said they evaluate trainees' behavior after they return to the job, including testing workers to find out what they've learned, while about half of employers look for quantifiable changes in business results, such as sales, labor costs, or error rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or no marketable skills. The problem is one of wasted resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training later on. Government-sponsored job-training programs have consistently posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they spent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, federal and state subsidies encourage students to pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and university classes might be better spent finding an employer that teaches useful skills. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Clinton administration and some Republican lawmakers have proposed that federal job-training programs be converted into vouchers for worker retraining. We need to go much further. Washington and the states should direct all subsidies and financial aid for post-secondary education and training directly to students and away from any particular institution. Business and payroll taxes should also be reduced to allow firms and workers to spend more of their own money on education and training. And workers should be allowed to accumulate funds (including unspent subsidies) in tax-free Educational Savings Accounts to pay for career changes and retraining in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This approach would empower workers to make their own decisions about their needs and would make better use of this country's largest and most effective educational system: private business.

<h2>State Think Tanks Take Aim</h2>
<b>by Lawrence W. Reed</b>
</center><P>
<b>Ambush in the Ozarks</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Little Rock, Arkansas -- Higher taxes may be popular in Bill Clinton's White House, but back where Clinton comes from, they're about as welcome as subpoenas at the Rose Law Firm.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By a whopping tally of 87 percent, Arkansas voters last January  rejected Governor Jim Guy Tucker's plan for a huge increase in state spending for highways. Tucker sought approval to issue $3.5 billion in bonds, to be repaid by hikes in the state's general sales tax and diesel-fuel tax, and by a new excise tax on wholesale gasoline. Thanks to voters, Arkansas motorists avoided having to pay the highest diesel-fuel and gasoline taxes in the South.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tucker had barnstormed the state, attempting to convince voters that the additional state debt and higher taxes would yield better roads and a stronger economy. Opponents argued that the excessive growth of state spending over the years had crowded out funding for the roads, and therefore Little Rock should tighten its belt and finance highways by cutting general spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Proving that good research and persuasive ideas can move public opinion, the Arkansas Policy Foundation (APF) joined the fray and played a key role in the Tucker proposal's lopsided defeat. Together with Arkansans Against Unreasonable Tax Hikes, a grass-roots organization, APF offered a convincing case that:
<P><ul><li> The plan would cost the average Arkansas family $500 in additional taxes;<p>
<li> Tucker's rosy forecast of economic growth from new state spending was careless guesswork at best, political snake oil at worst;<p>
<li> With an annual budget one-seventh the size of the bond program itself, the bureaucracy at the state highway department was ill-equipped to administer so many massive new road projects at one time.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Voters were swayed by the argument that state government was too fat for its own good. The foundation showed that, from 1962 to 1993, total state government spending in Arkansas soared by 327 percent after inflation. The number of state employees grew by 189 percent during the same period. Government in Arkansas, APF declared, had become "the state's number-one employer, as well as its largest growth industry." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Speculation is that the 13 percent who voted for the tax hikes were all state employees. <p>

<b>Revising Michigan's History</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Midland, Michigan -- If those who forget history are condemned to repeat it, then those who rewrite history are surely condemned to eat their own words. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Revisionist history is under fire in Michigan in a new study from the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. In "Are Michigan History Textbooks Reliable?" senior fellow Burton W. Folsom documents the biases and distortions that are shaping the way youngsters think about the development of their state and the role of government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Courses on state history are typically taught at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels in Michigan schools. Almost every student reads one or two of only four texts on the subject. Folsom's review turned up several common and disturbing themes: Greedy private enterprise creates problems while always-helpful government solves them, labor unions are the worker's best friend and never harm the worker's interests, taxes enable worthy projects to be funded and produce few harmful consequences. Is it any wonder that American business spends $40 billion in remedial education programs?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost immediately after achieving statehood in 1837, Michigan's fledgling government embraced socialized railroads, canals, and other "internal improvements." The experience proved so disastrous that the state constitution was rewritten in 1850. Its replacement expressly barred the state from starting or owning any portion of any commercial enterprise, and even banned the state from having anything to do with further internal improvements. A liberated economy led to an explosion of entrepreneurship, producing world-class industries in autos, furniture, and breakfast cereal. That lesson is omitted entirely from all four books.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The worst of the four texts, Folsom found, is larded with politically correct multicultural themes. In <I>Michigan: The World Around Us</I>, the "struggles" of minorities and women are set against the backdrop of white males who seem rarely to do anything that isn't mean-spirited and selfish. In one instance, author JoEllen Vinyard rewrites the story of a famous 1763 massacre of British settlers at Fort Michilimackinac, informing her student readers: "The Native Americans fought bravely to defend the land and the freedom that the British were taking away from them." Every single sentence about events in Michigan since 1960 deals with civil-rights turmoil. One wonders how anybody in Detroit ever found time to make cars.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The study prompted extensive press coverage throughout Michigan and a cascade of orders from concerned parents and school-board members. One textbook author pledged to make corrections in his next edition. Parents in other states might want to ask, "What are our kids learning under the guise of history?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Dayton, Ohio -- An alliance of five state-based think tanks in the Midwest is working to bring an end to the War Between the States, a war fought not with bullets but with subsidies and gimmicks designed to lure businesses from one state to another.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assembled by the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, in Dayton, Ohio, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, in Midland, Michigan, and other think tanks in Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska, a group of more than a hundred distinguished economists and policy analysts recently signed a joint resolution calling for an end to state-run "industrial policy." The experts want states to compete with each other, but by reducing overall tax and regulatory burdens instead of by granting special favors to selected firms.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Government cannot pick winners and losers in the marketplace effectively," says economist Sam Staley, a vice president of the Buckeye Institute. "The best economic-development policy is one that cultivates a 'fair field with no favors,' in which states attempt to attract businesses by improving the general climate for enterprise and making government itself lean, unobtrusive, and inexpensive." Adds Bill Styring of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, "States must recognize that each can foster superior and sustainable growth if they spend less energy on a few trees and care instead for the forest as a whole."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The resolution urges state governments to "terminate targeted business assistance such as direct grants, selective tax incentives, and abatement programs and adopt comprehensive strategies of tax relief for all firms and citizens, deregulation, and competitive systems of education." Ohio state senator Chuck Horn, the chairman of the Economic Development Committee in the senate, is taking the advice of these distinguished economists one step further: He is planning a regional conference of legislators to address the problems created by state-sponsored "industrial policy." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The resolution is the latest volley of criticism launched against the economic war between the states. Studies show that harmful subsidies and discriminatory tax policies are proliferating, and governors like Michigan's John Engler are urging a cease-fire. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Olympia, Washington -- All over America, limited-government advocates are way ahead of the Big-Government crowd when it comes to "the vision thing." They are churning out blueprints while the other side -- often demoralized and devoid of ideas -- campaigns to preserve a failed status quo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This hopeful trend is evident in Washington state, where voters in 1994 dethroned the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and elected Republicans in seven of the state's nine congressional districts. In the state legislative elections, voters handed control of the state's house of representatives to the GOP.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Taking advantage of the friendlier climate for conservative ideas, the Evergreen Freedom Foundation (EFF) has released "Reducing the Size and Cost of Government," a 115-page report that calls for sweeping change. Authors Bob Williams and Lynn Harsh outline broad principles for guiding virtually every aspect of government in the state of Washington, from tax policy to welfare reform. If public policy were to be consistently developed within the legal constraints and purposes of both the state and federal constitutions, they argue, the result would be a radical reduction in government itself.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mike Lowry, Washington's Democratic governor, proudly calls himself a "liberal," but he lauds EFF as "an important source of ideas about how to make state government operate as efficiently and effectively as possible." The document addresses various proposals for "reinventing government," advances the principles for reform, and explains how to develop new accountability mechanisms for government.<p>

	EFF calls on Washington to join the privatization revolution. In Washington, it's illegal for private contractors to wash windows in state office buildings even if that's the cheapest and best way to get the job done. Only state employees are allowed to mow lawns at public sites. No private firm can manage the state's mail rooms, maintain its computers, or assist in procuring supplies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason? Public-employee unions have secured ironclad provisions in state law that keep such work in the hands of overpaid, underperforming, unionized bureaucrats. For legislators and concerned citizens everywhere, the paramount question of the day is, "What should government do and what should it leave alone?" The answers are found in this latest volume from the Evergreen Freedom Foundation.<p>

	In February, <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org"><b>Capital Research Center</b></a> announced it was adding a fourth newsletter to its stable of publications. <b><I>Foundation Watch</I></b>, a monthly, will investigate the cultural activity of large private donors like the Ford, Rockefeller, and MacArthur foundations, and examine how these foundations respond to dwindling federal support for the arts and humanities. The first issue, for example, reports on the role the Charles F. Kettering Foundation is playing in PBS's "Democracy Project," which the newsletter calls a "multi-million dollar experiment to reorganize the political process to [the foundation's] own liking." <b>Laurence Jarvik</b>, who has written two books on the federal government's role in the arts, joins CRC as a fellow in cultural studies and the editor of <I>Foundation Watch</I>.

<b>Kay Coles James</b>, formerly Virginia's Secretary of Health and Human Resources under Governor George Allen, became the dean of <b>Regent University's Robertson School of Government</b> on March 1, 1996. James was an energetic advocate of welfare reform, and helped shepherd through the state legislature a reform bill with stiff work requirements for welfare recipients. James has served as a senior vice president of the Family Research Council, the associate director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the president of the Black Americans for Life Committee. At Regent, located in Virginia Beach, she will be stewarding a public-policy school in its fourth year.

	The new <b>Center for Jewish and Christian Values</b> will host its inaugural event, a leadership conference, at the Holiday Inn in Crystal City, Virginia, on May 20, 1996. The center was launched last December to promote discussion between Christians and Jews about moral issues, to encourage Christians and Jews to develop a common set of principles for building a more moral society, and to advocate needed changes in public policy and popular culture. At the event, <b>Michael Novak, Jack Kemp, William Galston, Gary Bauer, Michael Medved, Wade Horn, Rabbi David Saperstein,</b> and Senators <b>Joseph Lieberman</b> and <b>Dan Coats</b> will discuss the role of American law in the breakdown of the traditional family; efforts to match at-risk, fatherless children with responsible adults; Hollywood's effect on popular culture; adoption; and the role private religious institutions can play in delivering welfare. <b>Chris Gersten</b>, a former Bush administration official, is the director of the center. "I hope we will be able to create a coalition of Christian and Jewish clerical leaders and laity," says Gersten, "to challenge the moral decadence that has taken root throughout our country and in our cities."

	Last January, the <a href="http://cec.pff.org">Center for Effective Compassion</a> named <b>David Kuo</b> as its executive director. Founded in November 1995 by <b>Arianna Huffington</b> and <b>Marvin Olasky</b>, the Center for Effective Compassion is a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the  government-centered, bureaucratic, and impersonal welfare system into one that is community-oriented, decentralized, and focused on people. It advocates providing the needy with help that is challenging, personal, and spiritual. Kuo has served as policy director for Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri and the deputy director of policy at Empower America. Kuo has also authored or coauthored five books, including the forthcoming <I>Active Faith</I>, written with the <b>Christian Coalition's Ralph Reed</b>.

<a name="what"><h2>WHAT WORKS</h2>

<b>Businesslike Nonprofits</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A former aide to Democratic senators Gary Hart and Bob Kerrey, <b>Bill Shore</b> left political life in 1984 to found <b>Share Our Strength</b>, a nonprofit anti-hunger organization run like a for-profit business. Today, Share Our Strength earns over $30 million a year, which it distributes to more than 800 community-based organizations in the U.S., Canada, and the developing world. In his book <I>Revolution of the Heart</I>, published last year, Shore describes the nonprofit sector as "rich in compassion and idealism" but "entrepreneurially bankrupt." Shore argues that nonprofits should stop relying on government and foundation grants. By combining social idealism with hard-headed business sense, he contends, nonprofits can become financially self-sustaining. Then they will be able to spend their money "in accordance with [their] best judgment, and not in ways distorted by the desire to please certain grantmakers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<I>Revolution of the Heart</I> also contains a resource directory of organizations that strengthen communities, such as <b>Break Away</b>, a group in Nashville, Tennessee, that "matches college groups with local nonprofits to provide 'alternative' spring breaks focused on volunteering and community service," and <b>Rural Coalition</b>, an organization based in Arlington, Virginia, that "works to meet the nutrition and health needs of low-income rural populations, especially farm workers and rural minorities."

<b>Reform Bureaucrats?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	While many welfare-reform advocates view work-oriented reform as a step towards reducing the size of government, Princeton scholar <b>Lawrence Mead</b> warns that we must not underestimate the importance of government in making reform work. Success in Wisconsin highlights the importance of government as an agent of change. Since 1987, welfare rolls in Wisconsin have declined by 26 percent. Governor <b>Tommy Thompson</b> has placed a two-year limit on cash welfare benefits, developed a state-of-the-art computer system for tracking welfare fraud, and has permitted local governments to contract out portions of their welfare services. Most importantly, however, Thompson has energized the bureaucracy by offering it a challenge: to help the poor gain financial security and independence through work. Today, welfare administrators in Wisconsin promote work and encourage people to seek support from nongovernmental sources, including extended families.

<a name="tales"><h2>CAUTIONARY TALES</h2>
<b>Underchallenged Undergraduates</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In March, the <a href="http://www.nas.org"><b>National Association of Scholars (NAS)</b></a>, based in Princeton, released a 68-page study that concludes America's leading colleges are failing to provide undergraduates with a broad and rigorous exposure to major areas of knowledge. NAS examined the general-education and course requirements for the bachelor of arts degree at America's 50 highest-ranked schools in 1914, 1939, 1964, and 1993. After assessing the prevalence, content, and rigor of mandatory courses, NAS asserts that "today's students at leading colleges and universities are not held to the same exacting standards that prevailed as early as 30 years ago."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Many of the required survey courses that once acquainted students with a range of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences have been purged from university curricula; as a result, we are "in danger of losing the common frame of cultural reference that for many years has sustained our liberal, democratic society."

	The ninth annual edition of <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy</I> by the <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org"><b>Capital Research Center</b></a> confirms yet again that U.S.-based corporations often fund nonprofit organizations that work against their interests. For every dollar American companies donate to free-market advocacy groups, they contribute approximately four dollars to proponents of big government and market restrictions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Anheuser-Busch, Freddie Mac, Borden, Fannie Mae, Hewlett-Packard, Dayton-Hudson, WMX, J.P. Morgan, Bell Atlantic, AT&T, and BankAmerica are fingered as America's 10 worst corporate givers (those that give the most money to left-wing advocacy organizations). In 1993, Exxon donated $5,000 to the Environmental Law Institute -- the same organization that laid the legal groundwork for holding Exxon criminally responsible for the Valdez oil spill.

<b>Urban Outrage I</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	To opponents of tort reform who argue that cautious judges and skeptical juries are stemming the tide of frivolous tort litigation, <b>Richard Miniter </b>says guess again. New York City, which has no serious tort reform, paid out 187 percent more in tort awards in 1994 than it did in 1984. Despite the city's efforts to improve safety, all kinds of injury claims are up. The increase has been fueled not so much by a rise in the number of cases brought against the city as the size of the awards paid out. What's more, personal-injury claims account for 90 percent of the claims brought against the city. Miniter challenges Governor George Pataki to tackle the trial-lawyer lobby and bring tort reform in New York.

<b>Urban Outrage II</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In New York, argues <b>Sol Stern</b>, educational vouchers are the "school reform that dares not speak its name." This is not because vouchers are unpopular: New Yorkers favor vouchers for public, private, and parochial schools by a margin of 54 to 42 percent. Rather, politically powerful teachers unions have blocked voucher reform. The result, Stern contends, is that public education in New York remains a "$25-billion monopoly industry" whose "first priority is the job security and well-being of the more than 250,000 people who make their livelihoods from it." Stern believes that the only way to reform New York's educational system is through vouchers. Other reform proposals are "system preserving." Only vouchers can transform the system by destroying the teacher-controlled educational monopoly.

<b>Urban Outrage III</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation agreed to fabricate and install a set of 15-foot metal letters on the roof of a factory building in New York City, its president, <b>Tama Starr</b>,  had to sign a 101-page contract, including 20 separate documents spelling out affirmative-action requirements. One document required iron workers on the job to be 58.53 percent minority and 7.63 percent female.  But another document required that the contractor "will not discriminate . . . on the basis of . . . race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or affectional preference." "That is all very nice," Starr observes in an article for <b><I>Reason</I></b>, "but on the previous page, the contractor was required to discriminate."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Although she had no idea how to comply with these mutually contradictory requirements, Starr signed the contract. She notes, however, that many good companies deliberately refrain from bidding on government or government-subsidized work. "So the government will get what it wants," she writes, "contractors whose race/gender composition meets government goals, while taxpayers, as usual, foot the bill: in increased costs, in substandard work, and in the payroll of the genetically-approved bureaucrats who scrutinize the reports."

<a name="thoughts"><h2>THOUGHTS ON CIVIL SOCIETY</h2>

<b>The Conservative Dilemma</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In his Francis Boyer Lecture at the <b>American Enterprise Institute</b> last winter, <b>George F. Will</b> argues that conservatism suffers from a potentially crippling contradiction. On the one hand, it advocates "blanket disdain for government." On the other, "conservatism's vision of civic virtue . . . depends on respect, even reverence for our political regime -- for our constitutional order understood as a formative enterprise." Conservatism's challenge is to resolve this contradiction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Founders, Will argues, recognized and intended that our constitutional, popular government would bear responsibility for shaping the nation's citizenry: "Statecraft, as the Founders understood it, is soulcraft." Specifically, the Founders designed our Constitution to promote citizens that could govern themselves, principally by denying themselves dependence on government. That's why the Founders carved out a role for a strong central government. A strong central government, they believed, would relieve citizens of their dependence on local and state governments. Says Will, "The Founders hoped that one effect of exalting central government over other governments would be a diminution of the total amount of government -- local, state and national." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	National government, of course, was to be strictly limited by enumerated powers. But this government was not realized. The Founders had hoped that the acquisitive spirit characteristic of liberal society would be confined to the pursuit of wealth through commerce. Rather, our acquisitive animus was directed towards the central government, from which we have sought well-being. Liberal government has been our accomplice, promoting for some 60 years now the idea that it is the government's responsibility to provide for our material well-being.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To reverse this trend, Will asserts, conservatives must change public opinion. Americans must consent to "government that censors their desires." And just as the Founders intended government to forge the character of its citizens and liberals have used it to fashion a citizenry dependent on government, conservative government must teach us that it is consistent with our constitutional principles to be less dependent on it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To do this, however, government must be respected. And here lies conservatism's paradox: "Conservatism depends on eliciting from citizens a public-spirited self-denial," Will says. "But that is not easily elicited in a commercial republic of the sort conservatism celebrates, where individualism enjoys maximum scope for private pursuits."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Sure, conservatives fail to promote respect for the government through their "blanket disdain" for it. But more importantly, conservatism seems to promote the same acquisitiveness that liberals have promoted for so long. Conservative anti-government rhetoric renders the government just as servile as it has been under liberal regimes. "And respect is never accorded to the servile," he says. Will's advice: Abandon the populist banner and try instead to articulate how our Constitution and our government requires of our citizens greater independence and greater virtue.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;You know when you play a game of football, you don't call up Washington every time you want to know what's the next play. . . . Too many people in America believed in the past that in order to do something you had to dial the equivalent of 1-800-BIG GOVERNMENT to find out what you should do, but the real strength of our country has always been individuals make those decisions, families make those decisions, communities make those decisions, to tackle the problems we face.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So when you play a game of football, you are not always looking over your shoulder at Washington to figure out what the next play should be. There's no way it could be done. . . . For almost 200 years in America, we had the belief that we could do it on a community level, working together, often voluntarily, whether it is churches, synagogues, charities, schools, hospitals, professional associations, cultural activities, sports activities. We always did things on a local level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Well, now, this new age we're entering into, we can rediscover those basic strengths so you don't have to dial 1-800 BIG GOVERNMENT to figure out what  the next play should be, to figure whether you should throw the Hail Mary, charge, fourth down and you got one yard to go, whether you should punt or run.

<B><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</B><BR>
<a href="toc.html">May-June 1996, Number 77</I></a>
<p></center>
<h2>Armey: "Clinton Crunch"</h2>

<p>
	House Majority Leader <b>Dick Armey</b> came to Heritage on February 27, 1996, to announce a nine-point Republican agenda to reverse what he called the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch"</a> --  rising taxes and sinking incomes for working families. Armey's proposal calls for: (1) cutting taxes on investment to create jobs; (2) cutting taxes for working families with children; (3) protecting pensions for working Americans; (4) streamlining regulations that stifle wages and increase prices; (5) reforming the health-insurance market to eliminate "job lock"; (6) empowering workers by consolidating worker-training programs; (7) enforcing the Beck decision to end the hidden tax that forces union workers to support partisan politics with their dues; (8) voting on a constitutional amendment to limit taxes; (9) and eliminating wasteful government spending to move power back to the states.
<p>
<h2>Alexander: Citizenship Agenda</h2>
<p>

	Arguing that "less from Washington has to go hand in hand with more from ourselves," <b>Lamar Alexander</b> called for a "citizenship agenda" in a speech at Heritage on January 5, 1996. This agenda means not only dismantling government but also "making it easier for Americans to rebuild those institutions that bind us together: the family, the neighborhood, the church, the synagogue, the school, and the community." Among his specific proposals: job-training vouchers, $1 billion in scholarships to needy schoolchildren, and an end to the federal government's role in welfare.
<p>
<h2>Buchanan: "Judicial Dictators"</h2>
<P>

	We today have a government of the judiciary, by the judiciary, and for the judiciary," argued <b>Patrick Buchanan</b> in a January 29, 1996, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/lect553.html">lecture</a> at Heritage. To rein in the "out-of-control Court," Buchanan proposed several changes: (1) Appoint federal judges to a term of years rather than for life; (2) make federal appellate and district court judges subject to removal by voters; (3) use the authority granted to Congress by the Constitution to restrict the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; (4) subject to popular vote each fall any decision of the Supreme Court that creates a new right or overturns a state or federal law; (5) allow the states to amend the Constitution without the approval of Congress. 
<P>
<h2>Index of Economic Freedom</h2>

<p>
	Hong Kong's economy has been rated freest in the world by the latest edition of Heritage's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>. Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy; the United States ranked seventh.
<p>

	Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including banking, foreign investment, taxes, trade, monetary policies, the size of its government sector, property rights, regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries were given ratings of one (best) to five (worst) in each category. 
<P>

	Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received the best score, ranking 12th. The People's Republic of China, on the other hand, ranked near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and Congo for 121st place.
<p>

	Several countries showed significant improvement from a year ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to Heritage authors <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a> and Thomas P. Sheehy.

<P>
<h2>New Bradley Fellows</h2>

<p>

Three scholars have joined Heritage as Bradley Fellows to write books on citizenship themes.
<P>

	<b>John J. Miller</b> is calling for a return to the policies of Americanization that helped turn the immigrants of a hundred years ago into citizens proud of their new country. Miller examines whether today's newcomers are embracing the principles of the American political tradition; participating actively in business, churches, and community self-help groups; and learning English as well as earlier immigrants -- and if not, whether policies such as bilingual education are discouraging assimilation. Miller is the vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. An <a href="miller.html">excerpt</a> from his forthcoming book is included in this issue.
<p>	Building on the work of Marvin Olasky, who wrote <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion</I> as a Bradley Fellow at Heritage, <b>James L. Payne</b> is studying how the 20th-century welfare state has departed from sensible charitable policies of the 19th century. His book will discuss the theory and practice of "expectant giving," social assistance that challenges recipients to change their behavior or to contribute to their support. Payne, who heads Lytton Analysis and Research, in Sandpoint, Idaho, is author of 11 books, including <I>The Culture of Spending: Why Congress Lives Beyond Our Means</I> and <I>Costly Returns: The Burdens of the U.S. Tax System</I>.
<p>

	<b>Andrew Peyton Thomas</b>, an assistant attorney general of Arizona, is writing a book on how law enforcement and community standards have been undermined by Supreme Court rulings on criminal rights. Thomas is the author of <I>Crime and the Sacking of America: The Roots of Chaos</I>.

<h2>Powers Congress Cannot Delegate</h2><br>
<b>By <a href="http://aspin.asu.edu/~pctp/hayworth/hayworth.html">J.D. Hayworth</a></b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thomas Jefferson feared the tendency for government to grow and for liberty to yield. The Founders' solution was to create a central government with explicitly limited powers delegated by the people and enumerated in a binding constitution.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today the power of the federal government is nearly boundless. But even the critics of Big Government have overlooked an equally serious problem. Over the years, Congress has increasingly delegated its lawmaking powers to unelected and politically unaccountable bureaucrats. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A general principle of American jurisprudence, called the doctrine of "nondelegation," is that delegated powers cannot be redelegated. That is, Congress does not have the authority to give away its fundamental lawmaking powers. The Framers wisely followed John Locke's admonition that "the legislative cannot transfer the power of making law to any other hands." Thus Article I of the Constitution begins, "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress . . . ." For generations, the Supreme Court held that the transfer by Congress of any of these legislative powers to another branch or agency is unconstitutional.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the late 1930s, however, the Court reversed itself, and upheld laws by which Congress merely instructed agencies to make decisions that served "the public interest." Since then, Congress has ceded its basic legislative responsibility to executive agencies that craft and enforce regulations with the full force of law. The Supreme Court has not invalidated a single delegation of congressional power since 1935.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, evidence abounds that Congress has slipped its constitutional moorings. The Americans with Disabilities Act tells employers to make "reasonable accommodation" of handicapped workers unless there is an "undue hardship," but leaves it to the Department of Justice to determine what is reasonable (and required).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Occupational Safety and Health Act calls for workplace standards that are "reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe and healthful employment" but allows the secretary of labor to decide what that means. The Clean Water Act's mandate to protect "navigable rivers" permits the Army Corp of Engineers and the EPA to exercise control over any land that has a certain minimum water content. By law, commercial banks and investment firms can only affiliate if they are "well capitalized," a vague determination made by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. In 1994, the General Accounting Office measured the economic, social, and environmental cost of all regulations at more than $647 billion. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The dangers of delegating congressional authority to unelected bureaucrats are many. For one, it allows Congress to exercise its lawmaking authority and enjoy the plaudits from popular laws without taking responsibility for their legal consequences or their costs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the chief victim is accountability in government. Originally designed to be the most accountable branch of government, Congress has grown increasingly irresponsible. The fundamental link between voter and lawmaker has been obliterated by unelected regulators hiding behind bad laws. A handful of broadly written laws has spawned an alphabet soup of government agencies and an overwhelming regulatory burden that undermine the very idea of representative government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Several bills now before Congress seek to rein in unaccountable regulatory agencies. Unfortunately, these reforms aim only to improve regulations by imposing additional procedural requirements on the agencies. In effect, they seek to regulate the regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Instead, Congress should act to restore accountability in government by requiring itself to comply with Article I. The Congressional Responsibility Act would subject all regulation to Congressional approval. Under the bill, a regulation can be approved in one of two ways: (1) through an expedited process designed to limit debate and amendment and allow for a quick vote on uncontroversial regulations; (2) through the regular legislative process, whenever a majority of members agree to waive the expedited method. Regulations would only take effect if approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president. There would be no need to impose additional procedural requirements on agencies. The bill would not be retroactive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Sounds radical? This is an ideologically neutral and nonpartisan reform. Concerns about legislative delegation have been voiced by people as politically diverse as Judge Robert Bork and Nadine Strossen, the president of the American Civil Liberties Union.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If we are to restore constitutional government, Congress must first recover its legitimate powers and rein in the regulatory agencies of the executive branch. After all, rebuilding a limited federal government, whose elected representatives are accountable for the laws they pass, is the first step toward restoring the faith of the American people in their leaders and returning to the republic envisioned by our Founders.

 <a href="toc.html">May-June 1996, Number 77</a></i><p><p><p><h2>Knight Vision</h2>
<b>By Matthew Spalding</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the fall of 1881, Father Michael J. McGivney gathered a small group of men in the basement of St. Mary's Church in New Haven, Connecticut, to start an association to help his Irish immigrant parishioners in their new homeland. No one could have imagined that he was founding what would become one of the largest and most successful private philanthropic service organizations in the world.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a young assistant pastor, McGivney was not only the spiritual but also the civic leader of his church community. Like many clergymen during the great 19th-century wave of immigration, he was deeply concerned about the unique social burdens and heavy economic pressures faced by his ever-growing immigrant flock. He was equally troubled by the rise of American "secret societies" that tended to be both anti-foreigner and anti-religious. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The son of poor Irish workers, McGivney believed that, to be successful, immigrants had to assimilate into American society without weakening their religious identity and strong sense of family. He had long been active with the youth of his parish, and had earlier organized a total-abstinence society to combat alcoholism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At the age of 29, McGivney set out to establish a Catholic men's organization that would draw immigrants into American society while strengthening their Catholic faith and pride -- a transforming institution that would loosen Old World ties and build new civic bonds informed by a Catholic heritage. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The result was the Knights of Columbus. McGivney named the organization after Christopher Columbus, the Catholic discoverer of the New World, to emphasize the Catholic contribution to America. Members called themselves "knights" to emphasize their service to God and country. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The economic backbone of the organization was a program for life insurance and sick benefits that helped meet the basic expenses of families overwhelmed by illness or the death of the breadwinner. Early membership dues supported a benevolent fund that paid members $5 a week during illness, and a levy of $1 a head funded an endowment that paid $1,000 to a member's family upon his death. These benefits attracted new members and provided financial stability for the organization. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Knights of Columbus were built upon four principles -- Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism -- that are reflected in their activities to this day. They defend their faith in a pluralistic nation while welcoming all nationalities and building fellowship by means of their religious, social, and educational activities.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the years, the Knights have promoted American and Catholic history, and have supported Church activities and programs throughout the world (such as Pope John Paul II's recent trip to the United States). They encourage patriotism and loyalty to the country that defends their liberties. At the same time, they will fight for religious freedom (leading a 1922 battle to overturn Oregon's ban on private and parochial schools) and civic piety (spearheading a petition drive in 1954 to add the words "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance).<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the heart of the organization, as McGivney intended, has always been charity: supporting members and the community through private benevolence. In 1884, the Knights had 429 members and a budget of $168.60. Today, the Knights number more than 1.5 million members in 10,000 local councils and assemblies, mostly in the United States but also in Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, and several Central American and Caribbean countries. In 1994, the Knights gave more than $100 million in charitable contributions and 48.8 million hours in volunteer service. Over the last 20 years, their philanthropy worldwide has totaled $1.2 billion in contributions and 438 million hours of service. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The vast majority of charitable activities and community projects -- from food distribution, blood drives, and helping the elderly and retarded to pancake breakfasts and bowling leagues -- are designed and led by the local councils and assemblies and tailored to local needs. All this is accomplished without government aid.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;McGivney insisted that the organization be business-like and financially stable. "Make all returns regularly, promptly, and correctly," he directed. "Invest all surplus funds profitably, safely, and legally." Today, the once-meager insurance program is a thriving enterprise with $6 billion in assets and $30 billion in policy coverage. The profits from invested assets provide a solid base ($20 million in 1994) for annual charitable programs. The rest -- $80 million in 1994 -- is raised each year.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Born in Waterbury, Connecticut, McGivney was the oldest of 13 children, six of whom died in childhood. He was never of strong health, and died of consumption at the age of 38.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	His 13 busy years as a priest have resulted so far in 114 years of good works and community service. "He was a man of the people," wrote one close associate. "He was ever zealous for the people's welfare and all the kindliness of his priestly soul asserted itself most strongly in his unceasing efforts for the betterment of their condition."

<B>CORRESPONDENCE</B>
<HR><P><P><B><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I><BR>
March-April 1996, Number 76</b>
</center><p>
<center><b>Citizenship AmeriCorps Style</b></center>
<p>To the Editor:<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Contrary to John Walters ("<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/walt.html">Clinton's AmeriCorps Values</a>," Jan.-Feb. 1996), AmeriCorps is a successful program that reinvigorates the principle of citizenship. Consider AmeriCorps's work with Birmingham AIDS Outreach (BAO) in Birmingham, Alabama.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Birmingham has been hit disproportionately hard by the AIDS epidemic, particularly the black heterosexual community. Sufferers have gone without care and have been forced to go to emergency rooms -- at  the expense of the state -- for care that can easily be provided at home.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A proposal written by community organizations called for a team of individuals to provide in-home respite care for end-stage AIDS patients. Volunteers were needed to fill eight- to 10-hour shifts around the clock. The need overwhelmed an already substantial volunteer base, but volunteers from AmeriCorps answered the call.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The BAO/AmeriCorps program paid a living allowance to its volunteers for the same reason that elected officials are paid: They were providing a public service to our country. In doing so, volunteers incurred an opportunity cost that would have otherwise precluded them from volunteering. For example, several BAO participants were mothers who had worked their way off welfare and were trying to finance a college education.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The proposal was not written by bureaucrats but by a coalition of clergymen, citizens, nonprofit organizations, medical professionals, and businessmen. The local coalition designed its own policies and mechanisms concerning implementation and care delivery.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The BAO program will save state and the federal government close to $2 million over its initial investment by allowing patients to die at home rather than in a hospital at the expense of Medicaid. It is a clear example of the AmeriCorps mission: to build partnerships between public and private agencies in order to rebuild America.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a shame that Walters misunderstands the intentions behind the AmeriCorps program and the citizenship it embraces. While it would be nice if people could always solve their own problems, let's step off the ideological pedestal for a moment to realize that not everyone can. Citizens should be able to take care of one another in times of need. Feeding, bathing, and befriending a person dying of AIDS is neither a meaningless task nor a job deserving of only a meager living allowance, yet it has to be done. AmeriCorps makes it possible for people, welfare recipient and business executive alike, to do it -- to embrace true citizenship.<P>
<b>Kyle E. Kimball<br>Cambridge, Mass.</b><P><b>John Walters</b> responds:<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kimball assumes that just because AmeriCorps volunteers are doing good things that the program merits federal funding. A program that spends $500 million a year should produce results. But it is the unintended consequences of such programs that are often more significant -- witness the waste in the Medicaid program Kimball is proud to have corrected through his AmeriCorps program.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Good deeds would not disappear if federal funding for AmeriCorps were eliminated. What civic leaders may have accomplished with federal dollars in Birmingham, countless private, religious, and charitable groups throughout America are achieving without federal assistance. One lesson from Birmingham is clear: AmeriCorps has taught people at the grass roots to look to Washington -- not their local communities -- for assistance.<p><center><b>Common-Sense Criminology</b></center>
<p>To the Editor:<br>As a former public defender, I agree whole-heartedly with John J. DiIulio's argument in "<a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thiuli.html">Arresting Ideas</a>" (Fall 1995). If a criminal thinks he will be caught committing a crime, he will be less likely to commit that crime.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This law-breaking mentality lies within every reader. Do you accelerate when you are driving over the speed limit and spot a patrol car? If you don't, is it because you've just realized speeding is illegal or because you fear being caught?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With the exception of psychopaths and the slow-witted, most people, including criminals, will not break the law if they think they will be caught. Criminals rely in part on sights and sounds when calculating the likelihood of their capture. A thug doesn't mug a person inside a police station, next to a patrol car, or when he hears a siren, even if it may be an ambulance.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, criminals weigh the benefits of committing a crime against the costs they will incur if caught. A criminal is more likely to pass a forged check for $50 than commit armed robbery in a homeless shelter. As the length of a criminal's potential incarceration increases, a criminal is less likely to commit a crime.<p>
<b>Dan Coburn<br>Hamilton College<br>Clinton, N.Y.</b><P><center><b>Incorporation Intended</b></center>
<P>To the Editor:<br>I read with great dismay Rep. Bob Dornan's view of the Constitution ("<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html#dornan">Preserve, Protect, Defend</a>," Jan.-Feb. 1996). Dornan articulates three constitutional fallacies which must be addressed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, Dornan's essay is entitled "Government by Judiciary." This title aptly describes Dornan's incorrect view that judicial action that protects the precious liberties and fundamental rights of American citizens is merely an intrusion upon the "rights" of politicians. But in reality it is the job of the judiciary to stand astride the political branches, and majorities in general, to ensure that their actions are consistent with the basic constitutional guarantees granted to each individual citizen. In the end, Dornan's diatribe merely inflames the base bigotry directed towards those citizens who have been forced to seek judicial protection for their most basic rights: women, racial minorities, religious dissenters, and homosexuals.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, Dornan asserts that the loss of federalism is the price America has paid for the end of slavery. This view presumes that federalism is incompatible with a structure of substantive constitutional restraint upon each level of government. Dornan apparently believes that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments repealed federalism. On the contrary, they perfected the American experiment by establishing the protection of individual rights as the primary responsibility of each level of government found in the federalist system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, Dornan concludes that the principle of incorporation should be repealed. What would this mean in practice? Well, consider that the Supreme Court has concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the protections of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments "against" the states. In practice, therefore, each state must respect such basic principles as free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Dornan's constitutional universe, however, states and localities would be free to infringe upon religious liberty, free speech, or any other rights protected by the principle of incorporation. That most states and localities would not choose to infringe upon these rights is immaterial; the mere fact that these political entities would be capable of doing so is tantamount to concluding that Americans would be slaves to their government.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Contrary to sentiments expressed by the mythmakers who oppose judicial protection for individual rights, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended the principle of incorporation to be expounded, and enforced, by the Supreme Court. Senator Howard, a Framer, declares that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections encompass "the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution" and that "the great objective" of the Fourteenth Amendment was to "compel [the states] at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In direct contrast to the false contentions of absolute-majoritarian state interventionists, Howard forcefully asserts that these protections "are secured to the citizen solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts." It is clear that the misguided advocates of absolute "judicial restraint" in areas of fundamental rights and liberties have blamed the messenger (judges) for the message (constitutional protection of individual rights).<P>

<p>To the Editor:<br>
In his <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Welcome"</a> to the new <I>Policy Review</I> (Jan.-Feb. 1996), Adam Meyerson says, "The root cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others." Maybe.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When children have little or no parental guidance it does not take a genius to expect trouble. When a delinquent is not reprehended, publicly rebuked, humiliated, recidivism can be expected.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The root cause of crime is the lack of stigma attached to it. Spirituality is not needed to lead a moral life.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;You want your new format to build a bridge to liberals whose policies have failed. This is like trying to run a business by committee. If conservatives have the guts and wisdom to find new approaches to adult and juvenile crime, let them stand up and be counted. Nothing works better than success.
<p><b>James L. Robson<br>LaBelle, Fla.</b><p><center><b>Kind Words</b></center><p>
To the Editor:<br>
Bravo for adopting a "historic new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship" in the newly designed <I>Policy Review</I> (<a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Welcome,"</a> Jan.-Feb.). We are at a crossroads, or maybe close to a point of no return, having lost our sense of citizenship and our understanding of rights and responsibilities. Historians will look at the past 30 years and wonder how a nation founded on the principles of Washington and Jefferson -- how "one nation, under God" --  could have become so depraved.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current films based on the writings of Jane Austen remind us how far we have come from common sense and decency. It is wonderful to see these films well-attended and observe young people who seem to wonder how we have strayed so far.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The time is ripe. Thank you for supporting the American family with educational material and examples of people taking positive steps to make a difference for all of us. Our children are searching for role models, and you can provide them.<p>
<b>Joseph B. Famme<br>Arlington, Va.</b><p>To the Editor:<br>
I am writing to compliment you on the Jan.-Feb. issue of <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>. I particularly enjoyed your <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">presidential symposium</a> ("Preserve, Protect & Defend"). For the last 50 years, too many people have come to believe that the president's responsibility to the Constitution consists of appointing conscientious judges to the bench. That is only one part of the executive's responsibility. The president should also use the bully pulpit to fight for his constitutional vision, veto unconstitutional bills, and refuse to enforce unconstitutional legislation that is already on the books. That is what the oath of office is all about!<p>
<b>Timothy Lynch<br><a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a><br>Washington, D.C.</b><P>To the Editor:<br>I have been a reader of <I>Policy Review</I> for more than a year. I recently received the Jan.-Feb. 1996 issue and enjoy the new format and content.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Its <a href="/heritage/p_review/prstate.html">"Statement of Purpose"</a> and <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/letter.html">"Letter to Our Readers"</a> excite me and give me hope. We all know that our government, in its desire to help, has grown to hurt -- that "we the people" need to do it better through the wonderful liberties of our Constitution.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This publication is needed. I look forward to the wealth of information future issues will surely contain.<p>

<b>Private-Sector Conservation</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For decades, liberals have assumed that only action by the 
federal government can protect the environment and have argued that conservatives care little about 
environmental issues. Last December, the <a href="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise 
Institute</a> launched its new <b>Center for Private Conservation</b> to set the record straight. The 
center aims to publicize private-sector efforts to conserve the environment. To this end, it will publish case 
studies of private conservation and analyze how legal and social institutions either assist or hinder private 
individuals and communities pursuing environmental agendas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CEI Senior Environmental Scholar <b>Robert J. Smith</b> 
will supervise the project. In January, CPC reissued Smith's <i>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by 
Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife</i> and published CEI research associate <b>Michael De 
Alessi</b>'s <i>Emerging Technologies and the Private Stewardship of Marine Resources</i>. Smith 
and De Alessi, who oversees the day-to-day operations at CPC, argue that depletion of fisheries and other 
natural resources can be combatted by entrusting these resources to private ownership. CPC events and 
publications can be tracked in the CEI newsletter, <i>UpDate</i>.

<b>A Report Card on Schools</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For years, education reformers have called for independent 
assessments of public schools to enable parents to hold educators accountable for poor performance. 
Colorado has become perhaps the first state to deliver. <b>The Parent Information Center of the 
Independence Institute</b> in Golden, Colorado, monitors 176 school districts and 2,000 schools 
throughout the state. On the basis of standardized test scores, graduation rates, attendance levels, and other 
indicators, the center formulates report cards that evaluate schools and school districts. Parents can also 
receive general info on education issues like the pros and cons of phonics-based language education.

<b>Innovations in Government</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Boston's <b>Pioneer Institute for Public Policy 
Research</b> recently announced the nine winners of its fifth annual Better Government Competition, 
"Local Solutions to Public Problems." Among them: <b>William H. Mellor</b> and <b>John E. 
Kramer</b> of D.C-based Institute for Justice offered model legislation to deregulate the Boston taxicab 
market; Houston constable <b>Victor Trevino</b> reduced the crime rate in his Houston precinct by 36 
percent in three years by deploying 300 officer-volunteers (see <i>Policy Review</i>, Spring 1994); 
Indianapolis mayor <b>Stephen Goldsmith</b> has saved $18 million since 1992 by allowing city 
employees to bid for public contracts on an equal basis with private contractors.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The competition aims to elicit innovative solutions to public-
policy problems. Since it began, think tanks in Arizona, California, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Canada, and Great Britain have imitated the program. The competition's theme for 1996: "Criminal 
Justice."

announced the launch of the <B>Parents' Television Council</B> and the release of the <i>1995-96 
Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>. Jones is the honorary cochairperson of PTC, a division of 
<b>Media Research Center</b>, in Alexandria, Virginia. The <i>1995-96 Family Guide to Prime Time 
Television</i> assesses the suitability of prime-time television shows on all the broadcast networks for 
viewers of all ages. It does not evaluate programs for artistic merit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each review offers a summary of the show's themes and a 
traffic-light icon. A green light (e.g., The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) stands for "family-friendly," a yellow 
light (ER) warns of adult themes, and shows given a prohibitive red light (Beverly Hills, 90210) are judged 
unsuitable for children. Programs that showcase loving families, affirm traditional values like hard work 
and honesty, treat religion seriously, promote sex in the context of a loving marriage only, and frown on 
obscenity and promiscuity are likely to be designated family-friendly.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What kind of songs do Smashing Pumpkins sing? What does 
it mean when today's music artists want to "blaze up a stack"? For anyone lost in the maze of popular 
music's artists and language, <i>Entertainment Monitor</i> offers some guidance.

<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>Entertainment Monitor</i>, a monthly publication of 
California-based <b>Entertainment Information Services</b>, is nonpartisan, nonreligious, and does not 
make judgements about the music it describes. The mag recounts the story lines and themes of top-40 
albums and translates the slang they contain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <i>Monitor</i> tells us, for example, that Tha Dogg 
Pound's album, Dogg Food, is a collection of 17 rap and "gangsta rap" songs; that in one track, "I Don't 
Like to Dream About Getting Paid," the artist talks about leaving a regular job to make more money and 
attract more women by selling drugs; and that to "blaze up a stack" means to smoke marijuana.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Each album review is coded for content: "S" for sex; "V" for 
violence; "D" for drugs; "L" for potentially offensive language; and "SL" for potentially offensive slang. 
Songs that contain many profanities and a great deal of slang are quoted at length. The magazine also 
covers movies and television programs.

<b>How Far Have We Come?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In <i>To Empower People: From State to Civil Society</i>, 
published in 1977, <b>Peter L. Berger and Richard John Neuhaus</b> argued that "mediating 
institutions" --  defined as "those institutions standing between the individual in his private life and the 
large institutions of public life" --  could provide welfare services more effectively than big government. 
The <b>American Enterprise Institute</b> recently reissued this text, along with commentaries by 11 
distinguished scholars and a response by Berger and Neuhaus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gulf between presidential rhetoric and administration 
policy is a primary theme here. "Every president from 1968 to the present," write <b>Michael S. 
Joyce</b> and <b>William A. Schambra</b>, has promised "to reinvigorate states, small communities, 
and civil society's intermediate associations." But even the Reagan administration, contends  <b>James P. 
Pinkerton</b>, abandoned "the self-help ethos that Berger and Neuhaus had identified as the key to 
successful mediating institutions." One reason for this abandonment is that "the old paradigm of the 
welfare state continues to haunt the political discourse. . . . Intellectual habits die as slowly as other 
habits." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even when big government tries to encourage mediating 
institutions, it often undermines them. <b>Marvin Olasky</b> recounts the sad transformation of 
<b>HOBO (Helping Our Brothers Out)</b>, a religious charity that was successful in helping the 
homeless until it accepted government funds. By forcing HOBO to abandon its ministry as a condition of 
the aid, the government robbed it of its effectiveness. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Does this mean that government should leave mediating 
institutions alone? <b>Michael J. Horowitz</b> believes so, but <a 
href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> and <b>Douglas Besharov</b> think that 
government has a more positive role to play, provided that "mediating structures are an outgrowth of the 
individuals who comprise discrete communities and should always be dependent on these individuals for 
their continued existence." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All the contributors endorse a devolution of power to society's 
"little platoons." Michael Novak: "If the 20th century unfolded under the sign of the state, pictured as a 
beneficent mother sheltering her children at her bosom, the 21st century is likelier to see a rebirth of the 
idea of freedom, in communities of men and women eager to practice self-government both in their private 
and their public lives."

<p>

<b>Why Government Shouldn't Fund Charities (excerpt)</b>
<p>
<b>1. Direct government funding of social welfare agencies (including mediating structures) 
is likely to create the wrong winners and losers.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The process is analogous to establishing an industrial 
policy: that is, government tries to pick the best service provider (instead of the best manufacturer, 
for example). Unfortunately, governmental decisions are less likely to be correct than are the 
cumulative decisions of thousands, or millions, of consumers. Worse, once government funding 
begins, political pressures make it almost impossible to end support. Thus, in his research on the 
differences between private and government support for start-up companies, Allan Meltzer found 
that private decision makers were more successful because they were more likely to abandon an 
obviously unsuccessful project than was the government. In other words, government is not 
capable of performing the key aspect of good decision making: creating losers. Many Head Start 
providers, for example, were chosen for reasons having little to do with their ability to care for 
children -- and many others continue to be funded even though they are pale reflections of their 
former selves.
<p>
<b>2. Direct government funding of social welfare agencies can alter the nature of their 
services and raise their costs.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When government chooses the service (or agency) 
for clients, it often imposes costly quality standards on the it. Since government tends to impose 
regulatory standards with less regard for whether they result in a better service than do individuals 
(who must pay for the service out of their own pockets), government-supported services tend to be 
more expensive than those that individuals purchase themselves. And government often decides 
that it knows how to provide the service better than the actual provider, so that it often requires 
even successful providers to alter their programs. No better example of this two-sided dynamic 
exists than the quality-cost differentials between publicly and privately-funded child care.
<p>
<b>3. Direct government funding often requires mediating structures to abandon the very 
features, like religious activities, that make them effective.
</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, the government, through its police power, 
always has the authority to regulate the activities of mediating structures even when not giving 
them money (subject to various but limited constitutional constraints such as the right to the free 
exercise of religion). But the temptation to attach requirements to the behavior of mediating 
structures -- and the political support for doing so -- is greatly increased when there is direct 
funding. After all, goes the argument, the money is public money and must be spent in accordance 
with the "public trust."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>Douglas Besharov, excerpted from "Bottom-up 
Funding" in</i> To Empower People: From State to Civil Society, <i>just published by AEI 
Press. Besharov is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a visiting professor 
at the University of Maryland School of Public Affairs.</i>
<p>

<b>Test of Faith</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There is no group more unfairly caricatured than today's 
religious conservatives," writes <b>Karl Zinsmeister</b>, the editor of the <i>American Enterprise</i>. 
Far from being an intolerant minority trying to force its values on the larger society, Zinsmeister argues 
that religious Americans have launched a "defensive offensive" against an aggressive secularism that has 
attempted -- often successfully -- to exclude traditional believers from the public arena.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To help set the record straight, Zinsmeister devotes an entire 
issue of his magazine to a group portrait of the religious right. <b>Doug Bandow</b> describes the 
"parallel universe" of educational institutions, publishing houses, news channels, philanthropic groups, 
and political organizations developed by religious Christians. <b>Fred Barnes</b> looks at the 
"Orthodox Alliance" of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious conservatives whose goals, he writes, 
"are cultural and political, not religious." <b>Dale Buss</b> examines the poor coverage religion gets 
from mainstream media, and <b>Michael McConnell</b> analyzes the movement for religious rights.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Religious conservatism is put into historical perspective by 
two distinguished scholars. Intellectual historian <b>Gertrude Himmelfarb</b> compares today's 
Christian men's movement, <b>Promise Keepers</b>, to the 18th-century "open-air meetings where the 
Wesley brothers preached and gained converts." <b>Robert W. Fogel</b> calls the current religious 
ferment the "fourth Great Awakening," and offers thumbnail sketches of the three earlier "cycles of 
religiosity" in American history.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In all, the issue profiles 40 Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and 
Muslim religious conservatives. What emerges from this "focus group in print" is that for most members 
of the religious right, devotion to God and "helping others" are two sides of the same coin.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i> "Who Are America's Religious Conservatives?" American 
Enterprise, Nov.-Dec. 1995.</i>
<p>
<b>Religion and the Democrats</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Politics absent religion and morals, argues <b>Joel 
Kotkin</b>, senior fellow with the <b>Pepperdine University Institute for Public Policy</b>, is 
nothing more than power mongering. Before secular liberalism, religion played an essential role in 
American politics. In Tocqueville's America, it trained citizens to use and not abuse freedom. In the mid-
1800s and the mid-1900s, religion furnished civil-rights causes with their guiding principles and moral 
authority. Indeed, religion has been the fuel of progressivism in America. It would be today, Kotkin argues, 
if only we would let it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The solutions to the problems of the inner city lie in its black 
churches. They do more to alleviate urban plight than the government ever has. Kotkin argues that liberals 
should build on their success, reconnecting reform efforts to religious principles and institutions. "Sensible 
policies to foster this change," he says, "would include regulatory reform in urban areas, tax incentives, 
larger write-offs for charitable giving, and the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of many social 
services from government to nonprofit, community, and church-based organizations." 
<p>

Jan.-Feb. 1996.</i>
<P>
<b>Where Virtue Grows</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Democracy, argues <b>Mary Ann Glendon</b> in 
<i>Seedbeds of Virtue: Sources of Competence, Character and Citizenship in American Society</i>, 
requires "a higher degree of virtue in its citizens than any other form of government." But the critical 
problem of maintaining our democratic regime by fostering virtue has all too often been neglected by 
political theorists. The current volume, a collection of 13 scholarly essays, "aims to place that forgotten 
problem at the front and center of American public deliberation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 According to <b>James Q. Wilson</b>, "the West has 
irrevocably cast its lot with a culture that makes it easy, and seemingly natural, for the individual to 
triumph over the group." By contrast, "Islam and Confucianism are alike in elevating the collectivity over 
the individual," and believe that, in a century or two, "their way will be proved superior."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wilson emphatically disagrees: "As costly as its embrace may 
be, freedom is man's universal hope; its defense, his steady preoccupation." But for freedom not to 
devolve into lawlessness, "all of us, but especially the intellectuals, [must] recognize that the exercise of 
freedom presupposes the maintenance of a natural moral order that deserves respect and reaffirmation, an 
order that arises from the familial seedbeds of virtue." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For <b>William A. Galston</b>, the defense of freedom 
requires political theorists to start taking words like "virtue" and "character" seriously again. 
Unfortunately, "For two generations scholarly inquiry has been dominated by the belief that the liberal 
polity does not require individual virtue."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By contrast, Galston believes that "to an extent difficult to 
measure but impossible to ignore, the viability of liberal society depends on its ability to engender a 
virtuous citizenry." And the institution charged by the liberal democratic order with "the formation of 
character, including public character," is the family. "It follows," says Galston, "that if families become 
less capable of performing that role, the well-being of the entire community is jeopardized.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But <b>David Popenoe</b> argues that the decline of 
families is related to the decline of neighborhoods and communities. "To help restore social virtue," 
Popenoe concludes, "we as a nation should seek to protect and cultivate natural communities, preferably 
along residential lines. As individuals, we should seek to stay married, stay accessible to our children, stay 
active in our local communities, and stay put." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To strengthen natural communities, <b>David 
Blankenhorn</b> urges the government to adopt "a strategy explicitly based on restoring the institutions 
of the civil society." The "centerpiece" of such a strategy should be strengthening the institution of 
marriage. And when public policy proposals are debated, the first question to be asked should be, "Will 
this policy strengthen or weaken the institutions of civil society?"

<h2>WHAT WORKS</h2></a>

<b>Growth of the Grass Roots</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In <i>Revolution at the Roots: Making Our Government 
Smaller, Better, and Closer to Home</i>, <b>William D. Eggers</b> and <b>John O'Leary</b> assert 
that today's political climate is truly revolutionary. "The overarching aim of the current bottom-up 
revolution is to reduce, rather than expand, the size and scope of government." This reduction will be 
achieved by devolving authority from the federal government to local government and by devolving 
responsibility from local government to individuals, families, churches, and voluntary associations -- what 
Eggers and O'Leary describe as the "third pillar" or the "little platoons" of society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors examine the devolution revolution as it applies to 
policing, welfare, economic development, and education. They discuss, for example, how one division of 
the San Diego police department has reduced crime by deploying 175 community volunteers -- 115 of 
whom are senior citizens -- to collect evidence, take crime reports, and check on the homes of vacationing 
residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Wisconsin's <b>"Work Not Welfare"</b> program slashed 
welfare rolls 17 percent in the two counties it was implemented in 1994 by requiring welfare recipients to 
work while on welfare and terminating cash benefits after two years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <b>Salvation Army</b> shelter in Bell, California, 
moved 113 of its 165 boarders into jobs in 1993 by prohibiting sex, alcohol, and even provocative clothing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since <b>Mayor Stephen Goldsmith</b> eliminated nearly 
all of Indianapolis's taxicab regulations in May 1994, the number of taxicab companies has nearly doubled 
from 28 to 52 (all of which are minority or women-owned), fares have tumbled seven percent, and not one 
customer complaint has been registered with the city.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, 25 percent of the students at the <b>Marcus Garvey 
School</b> in South Central Los Angeles are on public assistance, yet at a cost of $3,600, this private 
school has pre-schoolers memorizing the 50 states, second-graders reading from college textbooks, and 
sixth-graders beginning on calculus.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The authors conclude that devolution's success ultimately 
depends on America's citizens -- the depositories of devolved authority and responsibility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>Revolution at the Roots: Making Our Government Smaller, 
Better, and Closer to Home, by William D. Eggers and John O'Leary (The Free Press).</i>
<p>
<b>What Comes After</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A book by the <b>Hudson Institute</b> profiles 16 
programs "that shun the governmentalist mindset and instead take a civic-sector approach to homelessness, 
drug addiction, poverty, illiteracy, illegitimacy, crime and health care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One Texas woman marshals dozens of volunteers, six 
refrigerators, four freezers, two stoves, and a $375,000 budget to deliver 20,000 sandwiches a month to 
needy Houston youth.  <b>Friends for Life</b>, a Waco-based organization that employs just 4 people 
(but enlists 4,000 volunteers) provides 8,000 abandoned and ailing senior citizens with legal, personal, and 
emergency assistance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <b>Austin Street Shelter</b> provides the homeless of 
Dallas, Texas, 100,000 beds a year at a cost of $3.19 per person per night. The shelter treats the soul as 
well, encouraging visitors to participate in Bible study classes it offers and offering residents incentives to 
secure jobs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Clean and Sober Streets</b>, located in the heart of 
Washington, D.C., frees 80 percent of its residents of drug and alcohol addictions through a strict and 
regimented treatment program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New York City-based <b>Student/Sponsor Partnership, 
Inc</b>., enables 929 disadvantaged students to enroll in neighborhood Catholic schools by enlisting 
sponsor-mentors to foot the bill. In a city where the high school graduation rate does not break 40 percent, 
76 percent of SSP participants graduate in four years and 90 percent go on to college.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Denver-based <b>Friends First</b> led a revolt in Colorado 
education by instituting an abstinence-centered sex-education program at 35 schools last year.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly all of these programs funnel 80 percent or more of 
privately funded budgets directly to their beneficiaries. "Instead of viewing government as the primary 
provider of services," write the authors, "we should first look to private sources: families, churches, 
charities, community development corporations, foundations, and businesses." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i> Is There Life After Big Government? The Potential of Civil 
Society, by Gregg Vanourek, Scott W. Hamilton & Chester E. Finn Jr. (Hudson Institute).</i>
<p>
<b>Crime and Religion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 1985 and 1992, the murder rate increased 50 percent 
for white males and 300 percent for black males. By 2005, the number of males in this age group will have 
risen 25 percent overall and 50 percent for blacks. Since six percent of males in this age group commit 50 
percent of the crime the group commits, we can expect that an additional 500,000 male 14 to 17-year-olds 
in the year 2000 will produce 30,000 more murderers, rapists, and muggers. And each generation of 
criminal youth seems more dangerous than the previous one. Today we fear Crips and Bloods and embrace 
memories of Sharks and Jets. What should we do about the coming wave of juvenile "super-predators"?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"My one big idea is . . . religion," writes <b>John J. DiIulio 
Jr.</b> Citing studies that demonstrate how religion immunizes youth against crime, DiIulio argues that 
public funds should be used to empower local religious institutions to act as safe-havens, provide adoption 
services, offer substance-abuse treatment, run day-care centers, and handle the youngest nonviolent 
offenders. And what about the reaction this policy prescription promises to elicit from ACLU-types? "Let 
them argue church-state issues all the way to the next funeral of an innocent kid caught in the crossfire," 
DiIulio writes.

<P>
<b>Arguing with Success</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Teen Challenge</b>, a faith-based drug-treatment program 
with 130 chapters around the country, helps 70 to 86 percent of its participants free themselves of drugs 
and alcohol forever. But the state had tried to shut the group down because it would not hire state-licensed 
counselors or offer state-approved classroom courses. (State-approved treatment is 24 times costlier and 
has a success rate in the single digits).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a later issue of <i>World</i>, the authors report that 
<b>Governor George W. Bush</b> intervened on Teen Challenge's behalf, postponing a shutdown until 
he introduced legislation to allow faith-based charities to seek certification from a nongovernmental 
agency. In November, Teen Challenge reached an agreement with the state: While the state revoked Teen 
Challenge's license, it also agreed to allow Teen Challenge to remain open as long as it adheres to its now 
state-approved program.

<b>Academic Value of Family Values</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A child's academic performance is more greatly affected by 
his family than by any other variable, even school, writes <b>William R. Mattox</b> of the <a 
href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council.</a> Poor or rich, single-parent or two-parent, families 
of all stripes enhance academic performance by establishing daily family routines, monitoring out-of-
school activities like TV viewing, setting high expectations, rewarding success, helping with homework, 
maintaining teacher contact, facilitating access to community resources like the public library, and 
stimulating reading and writing at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mattox offers four prescriptions. First, "parental 
involvement" must mean more than participating in the local PTA; it means hands-on educating by 
parents. Second, parent engagement, not economic efficiency, is the greatest benefit to school choice. 
Third, Americans must look beyond our classroom-based and district-dictated education system; 21st-
century schooling will take place in a more interactive setting where parents have a greater role in making 
education decisions. Finally, tuition tax credits are superior to vouchers because they are more fungible.

<b>Hometown Heroes</b></a>

	<b><i>Citizen</i> magazine</b>, published monthly by Focus on the Family, Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, tries to encourage good citizenship by recognizing "Hometown Heroes" in a regular 
department. This section offers inspirational stories about average Americans who have promoted a 
pro-family agenda in their communities. Every January, the magazine chooses a "Hometown Hero of 
the Year." Focus on the Family is a nonprofit communications, counseling, and resource organization 
dedicated to the preservation of the home. Hometown heroes featured recently include:
<ul>
<li><b>Jean Todd</b> of Pomona, California, organized a grassroots effort that prevented the 
establishment of a card-club casino in her community, despite being outspent 40:1 in an advertising 
battle with gambling interests.
<p>
<li><b>Bob McLellan</b>, a Buick dealer-turned-city councilman from El Cajon, California, and 1994's 
"Hometown Hero of the Year," successfully lobbied the state legislature to make it more difficult for 
children to purchase pornographic magazines from streetside vending machines.
<p>
<li><b>Rev. Tony Marciano</b> runs a spiritual recovery program out of his Central Union Mission, in 
Washington, D.C., that has reconnected more than 120 wayward fathers with their families.
<p>
<li><b>Keith Streuber</b>, the mayor of Hebron, Illinois, read a letter in the Chicago Sun-Times 
challenging pro-lifers to raise the unwanted children that restrictive abortion laws allegedly produce. 
He responded by placing an advertisement in the Sun-Times offering to take a pregnant mother into 
his home and to raise her child if she wanted to give it up.

<h2>CAUTIONARY TALES</h2></a>

<b>In Defense of the Flophouse</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	New York Times</i> columnist <b>John Tierney</b> spent 
an evening among New York City's poor, huddled masses at the White House Hotel, a flophouse on New 
York City's famed Bowery. He was surprised by what he found: For $10, this "lodging house" provides a 
clean, safe, and warm place to stay. Tierney was also astonished that this very effective shelter for the 
homeless is being threatened by do-gooder liberalism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Revolted by the idea that someone could make money from 
housing the homeless, New York politicians have passed legislation that prevents the formation of new 
flophouses and squeezes existing flophouses and single-room-occupancy hotels out of business through 
overregulation. Most recently, a court decision in a lawsuit initiated by legal services extended the city's 
rent regulations to lodging houses, making it more difficult for renters to expel dangerous and menacing 
residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The result: Flophouses, which provide residents better 
accommodations than city shelters at one-fifth the price, have become endangered. Meanwhile, the waiting 
list for public housing has 127,000 names.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i> "Save the Flophouse," by John Tierney, N.Y. Times 
Magazine, Jan. 14, 1996.</i>
<p>
<b>Second Thoughts on Devolution</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you favor returning power and authority to state and local 
governments, <b>Clint Bolick</b> suggests you consider Alexandria, Virginia. The city of 116,000 is 
administered by 74 boards, commissions, committees, task forces, and authorities. Businesses that want to 
locate there must file upwards of 16 permits and pay as many as six different taxes. Excluding schools, 
Alexandria employs more people per capita than Los Angeles, Chicago, or San Diego.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And what about schools? Alexandria spends $10,000 per 
student on a system that employs as many people outside the classroom as it does inside and whose high-
school students achieve mediocre test scores. Bolick concludes that "states and cities are just another form 
of big government." What's more, "they touch ordinary Americans in ways far more personal and 
meaningful than the national government." Bolick's answer: If you really want to be devolutionary, give 
power to individuals and the communities they construct.

<b>Should Charities Live Forever?</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	You manage a struggling nonprofit. Suddenly the nonprofit 
genie appears before you. With your first wish you ask for a big, fat endowment -- right? Writing in 
<i>Philanthropy</i>, <b>James L. Payne</b> counsels against it. Endowments are inefficient and 
debilitating. They enable some nonprofits to outlive the demand for their services, and more importantly, 
they remove the incentive nonprofits have to remain frugal and innovative. Payne's premise is that the 
small, independent, and usually struggling charities conservatives herald are successful precisely because 
they are "underfunded."

<p></center>

<h2>Rediscovering Religion</h2>
<p>
	Religion, it seems, has suddenly seized a prominent position in debates over values, culture, and 
public 
policy. In response, FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> 
examined recent social-science literature on the benefits of religious belief and observance. He recently 
published his findings in a Heritage paper, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">"Why Religion Matters: The Impact of Religious Practice on Social Stability."</a>
<p> 
	Among the apparent benefits of religious observance on society: Both strong marriages and strong 
families are closely linked to regular church attendance; regular churchgoers in the inner city tend to move 
out of poverty; moral judgment is massively strengthened; and regular practice of religion tends to 
immunize people against suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime, divorce, and other problems. 
Religious belief reduces the incidence of depression, raises self-esteem, and helps repair the social and 
psychological damage caused by drug addiction and marital breakdown. It appears even to be associated 
with longevity, reduced cardiovascular diseases, and faster recovery from injuries. Fagan quotes 
psychologist Allen Bergin: "Some religious influences have a modest impact, whereas another portion 
seems like the mental equivalent of nuclear energy." (<a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html"><I>Backgrounder No. 1064</I></a>)
<p>
<h2>Baltimore II</h2>
<p>
	In a follow-up to their December 1994 orientation session in Baltimore for 65 congressional 
freshmen, 
The Heritage Foundation and Empower America sponsored the "1996 Congressional Advance," a one-day 
conference for freshman and sophomore members of the 104th Congress.
<P>
	The second Baltimore conference took place January 25-26, 1996, and explored issues vital to the 
second legislative session of the 104th Congress. Featured speakers included Heritage Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; Robert Woodson, the president of the National 
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise; and Al Dunlap, the former CEO of Scott Paper Co.
<p>
<h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
<P>
	John Hood, a 1994-95 Bradley Fellow at Heritage and a regular contributor to the <a href="bless.html">"Blessings of Liberty"</a> column in <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American 
Citizenship</I>, has written the conservative answer to the corporate social responsibility movement. In 
his book <I>The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good</I>, to be published in June by the 
Free Press, Hood tracks the successes of business in such areas of social concern as environmental 
protection, workplace and product safety, family values, education reform, and the revitalization of inner 
cities. Hood shows that companies make a greater contribution to society through innovation in goods and 
services than through their philanthropy. Hood is now the president of the John Locke Foundation in 
Raleigh, North Carolina.
<p>
<h2>Welfare and Medicare</h2>
<p>
	In a recent <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1063.html">Backgrounder</a>, 
"Why 
Congress Must Reform Welfare," <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a>, a senior policy 
analyst at Heritage, shows:
<P><ul>
<li>The 4.7 million families currently receiving AFDC have already spent, on average, six and a half years 
on welfare; 
<p>
<li>When past and estimated future AFDC benefits are combined, the average length of stay on AFDC 
among those families currently receiving benefits is 13 years; 
<p>
<li>Among the families currently receiving AFDC, more than 90 percent will spend more than two years 
on the AFDC rolls.
</ul><p>
	Rector also discusses recent research by June O'Neill, the director of the Congressional Budget

<h2>Church Without State</h2>
<b>By John G. West Jr.</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Alexis de Tocqueville arrived in the United States in 1831, he was struck by how Americans were "forever forming associations." Instead of looking to the government for help, public-spirited citizens sought to solve societal problems on their own. Tocqueville may not have realized that this national enthusiasm for "associations" was largely of recent vintage. Although Americans had always been industrious, the explosive growth in civic associations did not occur until the second decade of the 19th century.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps no one deserves more credit for creating this culture of volunteerism than Lyman Beecher (1775-1863). Remembered today chiefly as the father of author Harriet Beecher Stowe and abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher, the elder Beecher was a powerful minister and reformer in his own right. As one of his colleagues commented, "In massive talent, Lyman Beecher stood among his brethren like Daniel Webster in the Senate -- alone."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As a young clergyman in the early 1800s, Beecher confronted a society in crisis. Church attendance was dropping, and alcoholism and other social ills were on the rise. The elite classes were abandoning orthodox Christianity for a demythologized religion of human reason. Elected officials were increasingly reluctant to enforce morality or piety by law, and there was growing support in the political sphere for abolishing tax subsidies for churches, which had long been the bulwark of Protestantism in New England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher viewed these developments with alarm. Like most ministers of the era, he believed that republican government could not survive without a virtuous citizenry, and that a virtuous citizenry depended on religion. In the absence of established churches and direct state support for religion, he feared the worst. But instead of despairing, he responded brilliantly: If the government would no longer support religion directly, the religious adherents themselves had to do whatever the government could not. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government used to promote civic virtue by compelling people to "support the gospel and attend the public worship of God," Beecher told the Connecticut legislature in 1826. "But these means of moral influence the law can no longer apply; and there is no substitute but the voluntary energies of the nation itself, in associations for charitable contributions and efforts, patronized by all denominations of Christians, and by all classes of the community who love their country."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beecher advocated replacing government support for religion and morality with a network of voluntary societies that would spread the gospel, inculcate moral habits in the young, and reclaim the dissolute. In those cases where government action might still be necessary, the associations would seek to create a political consensus through educational efforts. In a free society, Beecher realized, persuasion had to precede coercion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During his career, Beecher held four pastorates -- in Long Island, New York; Litchfield, Connecticut; Boston; and Cincinnati -- and traveled the Northeast and West speaking not only in churches but also at revival and reform meetings. His widely circulated sermons and tracts helped inspire evangelicals to organize scores of voluntary associations for evangelism, missions, and social and political reform. They formed groups to help alleviate poverty, teach reading and writing to the poor, and prevent alcohol abuse. Beecher himself took part in many of these efforts, such as the American Temperance Society and a group that promoted the voluntary observance of the Sabbath. The many private associations of the era transformed American society in a way that few government programs could.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"They say ministers have lost their influence," Beecher wrote years later. "The fact is, they have gained. By voluntary efforts, societies, missions, and revivals, they exert a deeper influence than ever they could" have with state support. He had learned through experience that the free-enterprise system in religion, far from being hostile to faith, created the conditions for true piety and civic virtue to flourish. Beecher was not the first to discover this truth, of course. Baptists and Methodists in America had long advocated the separation of church and state as beneficial to true religion. But at the time, they tended to view religion as a private matter without a clearly defined social role. Beecher's unique contribution was to show how religious groups could play a dynamic public role once direct state support of churches had ended.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even as Beecher championed Christianity's civic role, however, he keenly appreciated the limits of religious activism and recognized the dangers that politicking posed for Christianity. The political ambitions of some activists could easily overwhelm the message of the gospel and provoke public censure. Beecher advised Christians to confine their political efforts to the "great questions of national morality" and avoid formulating an explicitly Christian position on every political issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During our own era, when questions are again being raised about the proper role of faith in the public square, we all might learn from Beecher's free-enterprise and common-sense approach to religion in public life.

<CENTER><B>Daniel Casse on Lamar Alexander</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT></B>amar Alexander is an unorthodox, populist, and persuasive Republican
leader. That is why I gladly moved from Washington to Nashville
to work on his presidential campaign, and why I believe he will
be the party's nominee in 1996. 

<P>
Our legislative branch's leadership
of national government is a temporary (albeit fascinating) phenomenon.
But we need our next president to set the agenda, not take his
cues from Congress. Conservatives should be looking for a candidate
who can present a bold design for government along with the ability
to execute it. 

<P>
Lamar Alexander has the imagination, energy, and
executive background to do both. The major themes of his campaign-growth,
freedom, and personal responsibility-are indisputably conservative.
But what distinguishes him is his unorthodox approach to politics,
his populist style of governance, and his skills of persuasion.


<P>
<B>Unorthodox.</B> In 1978, Alexander was elected governor of Tennessee,
only the third Republican to win that office this century. Nothing
that followed was typical, either. He began his crusade to improve
Tennessee's pitiful public-school system by introducing merit
pay and master teachers, relatively radical notions that weakened
the teacher unions. The National Education Association fought
him vigorously. He ignored warnings that it was hopeless, fought
back, and won. 

<P>
Alexander broke new ground on other issues. At
a time when most governors were using state airplanes to fly to
Washington, Alexander closed Tennessee's D.C. office altogether.
He chided other governors for behaving like senators. As early
as 1981, he advised President Reagan to end the federal role in
education. Four years later, he called two relatively unknown
congressmen named Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott and invited them
to join a small group of GOP governors to plot a united strategy
for second stage of the Reagan Revolution. 

<P>
He showed the same
verve when he arrived at the Department of Education in 1991.
By then, the intellectual excitement of the Bill Bennett years
had passed, and the Bush administration's school-choice agenda
amounted to little more than photo-ops with local education activists.
Alexander understood that school choice-despised by country-club
Republicans and misunderstood by most suburbanites-was at risk
of becoming a political loser. His &quot;America 2000&quot; program
was a true grass-roots initiative that breathed life into education
reform. Conventional wisdom dubbed it a quirky agenda that offered
little federal legislation. But it tapped into a decentralization
movement that remains the only path to school choice. His 1992
school-choice bill was a true voucher program for public, private,
and parochial schools, but the Democrats in Congress made sure
it never came to a vote. 

<P>
<B>Populist.</B> Alexander's well-publicized
assault on Congress-&quot;cut their pay and send them home&quot;-is
no mere slogan. It reveals his deep sympathy with the populism
that has justifiably become the bedrock of conservative politics.
An unapologetic champion of term limits, he sincerely believes
that a citizen legislature would transform the character of the
federal government. With none of Ross Perot's demagoguery, Alexander
offers a mature, but no less revolutionary, brand of popular discontent
with government in Washington. 

<P>
While some Republicans still waver
on the wisdom of block grants, Alexander is advancing the idea
both philosophically and practically. He suggests ending the federal
role in education, welfare, and job training altogether. He applauded
the Supreme Court decision striking down the 1990 Gun-Free Schools
Zone Act, an attempt to federalize local responsibility that every
GOP senator supported. &quot;We know what to do&quot; is the central
tenet of his populist conservative political theory, which holds
that Americans should be given the freedom to make decisions about
their own lives. Although every Republican will offer bromides
about &quot;states' rights&quot; or &quot;new federalism&quot;
during the coming months, Alexander's own policy prescriptions
suggest a fully conceived populist vision.

<P>
<B>Persuasive.</B> If conservatives
are to remake government, we must do more than merely express
support for conservative ideas. We must also win over others not
fully in our camp. It didn't take much leadership to point out
that the Clinton health-care plan was a socialistic fantasy. The
political challenge was to convince half the nation-including
many Democrats-that the Clinton plan was bad medicine. 

<P>
The job
of president is almost entirely about setting a principled agenda
and then persuading the country of its wisdom. Alexander's public
career has prepared him to do just that. As governor, he led a
Democratic legislature toward his goals. When 38 governors competed
to get GM's Saturn division to build its plant in their states,
Tennessee won, in part because Alexander convinced the company's
executives that a right-to-work state with school choice, merit
pay, and no income tax was the best environment for business.
No tax breaks were involved. 

<P>
As the chairman of the National Governors
Association, he transformed its agenda by convincing fellow members-including
Bill Clinton, John Sununu, Dick Thornburgh, and Michael Dukakis-that
they should end their obsession with Washington issues and focus
on state matters instead. 

<P>
A president who is at once unorthodox,
populist, and persuasive will quickly establish a very different
type of presidency. But that is exactly what conservatives and
libertarians should be looking for next year.The danger we face
is that, with an irreparably damaged president in the White House,
Republicans will try to coast to victory in 1996 on a poll-driven
platform of GOP boilerplate.  Alexander will offer none of that
blandness. He governed Tennessee in the 1980s in much the same
way that Wisconsin's Tommy Thompson and Michigan's John Engler
govern in the 1990s. True, his view of the role of the federal
government may be at odds with much of established Washington.
But it is a view understood and applauded around the country.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paul Gottfried on Patrick Buchanan</B></CENTER>
<P>
The announcement by Pat Buchanan of his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination has done more to change the Republican
race than has the entry of any other candidate. More than any
other contender, Buchanan represents the populist right and has
fought all of its enemies. He has tangled with the liberal media;
the gay, feminist, and civil-rights lobbies; and the corporate
economic interests allied with big government. He has also dished
out, in his provocative speeches and blistering columns, fully
as much as he has taken. There is a certain bulldog tenacity about
him that even his bitterest opponents acknowledge. When Buchanan
believes he has been unfairly attacked, he stands his ground,
and he shows as much civility or incivility to his critics as
they display toward him. In 1992, I thought that he should have
done more to defuse accusations of being anti-Jewish, a charge
that plagued him particularly after he had linked support for
the Gulf War to the activities of Israel's &quot;amen corner.&quot;
But Buchanan would not apologize for what he--and others, including
commentators Michael Kinsley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner-took to be
a false charge. As he told his Jewish advisers, he would not dignify
a &quot;libel&quot; charge by responding to it. 

<P>No, I do not always
agree with Buchanan's positions, but they are honestly stated
and consistently held. Unlike senators Gramm and Dole, he has
not waffled on affirmative action or aid to illegal aliens, which
Buchanan has always opposed. And like Alan Keyes, but unlike most
of the other Republican candidates, he is genuinely opposed to
abortion. 

<P>
Equally important to me are the populist themes that
resonate in his campaigns. In the Wall Street Journal in 1993,
Irving Kristol predicted the inevitable success of a national
leader carrying out Buchanan's ideas. Buchanan's passionate concerns-violent
crime, immigration controls, the disintegration of morals, and
the disappearing jobs of American workers-are now, according to
Kristol, widely shared. New York cabdrivers, even those from the
Third World, express most of these concerns with equal vehemence.
Kristol is no friend of Buchanan or his candidacy, but he does
recognize the timeliness of his populist themes-and the foolishness
of those who would resist them. 

<P>
Buchanan belongs to a movement
that is also sweeping Europe. In Italy, Austria, and Germany,
there is a surging populist protest against capricious public
administration. There is also a growing demand that government
bring itself into line with the beliefs and traditions of those
it is intended to serve. Democracy, populists maintain, is not
an exercise in sensitivity training or the formulation of administrative
policy. It is the practice of self-government by self-identified
communities, whether regional or national. 

<P>
When the popular will
seeks to affirm traditional morality or limit the political community,
but is disregarded or overruled judicially, then both democracy
and citizenship are devalued. This is now a regular occurrence
in the U.S. The populist call for both political accountability
and true self-government has joined a conservative goal: the defense
of family and traditional communities endangered by a therapeutic
managerial state. 

<P>
Buchanan personifies the populist revolt against
this. Unlike neoconservatives and gentrified Republicans, he concedes
nothing, rhetorically or programmatically. He calls for seismic
change: devolution of power to states and open confrontation with
moral and cultural revolutionaries posing as value-free judges
or public servants. As president, he would not merely dicker with
liberal administrators. He would find ways to dispatch them and,
wherever possible, dismantle their agencies. 

<P>
Buchanan's spiritedness
and unwavering conviction persuade me that he would make a difference
as president. Unlike Ronald Reagan, he would not leave the Washington
power structure as he found it. He would make strenuous efforts
to restore the dual federalism established by our founders. 

<P>Buchanan
knows that genuine democracy must come from below. It cannot be
mandated from Washington or, in imperialist fashion, imposed abroad.
In our own country, democracy is an ideal to be recaptured, not
a blueprint to be forced on other nations. 

<P>
I doubt that Buchanan
would be a rigidly isolationist president. His stern warnings
against foreign entanglements have a constructive aim. He rightly
fears that our own society is deteriorating in many ways. Especially
now that our communist enemy is gone, it may be best to work on
domestic problems instead of shouldering the burdens of other
peoples.  

<P>
Nor should we encourage unskilled workers from less
developed lands to immigrate, take advantage of our social services,
and displace those most at risk in our own work force. America,
as Buchanan sees it, should hope neither to remake nor to absorb
the rest of humanity. In contrast to the nationalism expressed
by Ben Wattenberg, one of his frequent debating partners, Buchanan's
nationalism has no global imperative and is respectful of cultural
differences. Because of his feisty and principled character and
his democratic counterrevolutionary vision, I shall cast my own
vote in the Republican presidential primary for this modest nationalist.

<CENTER><B>DavidKuo on Bob Dole</B></CENTER>
<P>
The elections of November 1994 did more than usher in the first
conservative Congress in two generations. They also signaled the
public affirmation of a conservative agenda. In so doing, they
forced conservatives to change both their congressional and their
presidential perspectives. Suddenly, long-held conservative hopes
became new-found conservative realities. The balanced budget is
fashionable-the only real question now is whether it will be accomplished
through the budget process or through an amendment to the Constitution.
Federalism is renewed and devolution is the new buzzword. Illegitimacy
is bad and the family needs to be strengthened. As conservatives
consider whom among the presidential candidates to support in
1996, the question is, &quot;Who is best suited to take us to
the next stage of our conservative realignment?&quot; The clear
answer: Bob Dole. 

<P>The next stage of the realignment is not for
communication and symbolism, but for the detailed work of devolving
federal power, strengthening families, and reasserting American
interests abroad. It is a stage for implementing an agenda already
defined. 

<P>
Although some things may have caused conservatives some
angst, the simple fact remains: On every serious issue on our
agenda, Bob Dole is not only on board, he is the leader. 

<P>
This
is not a recent phenomenon. The man now calling for the abolition
of the departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development,
Education, and Energy is the same man who voted against creating
both Education and HUD. The man now speaking out against our nation's
social pathologies has a pro-life voting record of nearly 100
percent. The man now advocating a U.S. foreign policy based on
American interests has been one of the leading voices in foreign
policy for years. And the man who has pledged to balance the budget
has made tough choices, year after year, on spending cuts. 

<P>
Today,
Bob Dole is arguably the most respected statesman in the country.
He has proven himself an excellent strategist who remains cool
under fire, a coalition-builder, and a political achiever. He
has demonstrated both the courage and the decisiveness that will
be required to implement our agenda. 

<P>
Too often, conservatives
have belittled and diminished legislative experience as a liability-suggesting
that a man who legislates cannot be trusted with the ideological
mantle. But as Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and even Bill Clinton
have learned, accomplishing-legislating-is difficult business.
Any agenda, however aggressive, however bold, however visionary
is merely an agenda unless it is implemented. But Majority Leader
Dole is not only a legislator, he is a master at getting things
done. And President Dole would be able to translate his experience
and ability into the tough work of reversing 30 years of growth
in the welfare state. 

<P>
Many contend that the president's most important
role is commander-in-chief of our armed forces, and they may be
right. Though Cold War pressures have receded, our recent dalliances
in Somalia, Bosnia, and North Korea testify to the continuing
need for serious and responsive leadership. Bob Dole, who has
emerged as the leading Republican voice in foreign policy, would
bring to the presidency a developed view of world affairs. His
view combines two things: an expansive interpretation of America's
role in the world and a personal and pragmatic understanding of
the dangers of global involvement. 

<P>
For someone who has worked
for both the National Right-to-Life Committee and Empower America,
all of these things are important. But the real source of my attraction
to Dole lies elsewhere. The true reason I believe Bob Dole should
be president of the United States stems from his character. 

<P>
The
presidency helps define the character of the country. People look
to the president for leadership, inspiration, and guidance. The
president should be someone to whom parents can point and tell
their children, &quot;Be like him.&quot; In Bob Dole, parents
could point to someone who served his country in war, overcame
physical infirmities thought to be insurmountable, and dedicated
his life to serving the American people-all good and noble things.
He has also proven himself to be a man who keeps his word.

<P>
In the 1980s, following a decade of turmoil and the &quot;malaise&quot;
presidency, America needed a particular kind of conservatism-an
inspiring conservatism of sweeping visions, a conservatism that
could hasten the downfall of communism abroad and the restoration
of confidence at home. In President Reagan, it had an unparalleled
leader. But America now needs something very different. It needs
a conservatism that is still visionary, but one whose greatest
virtue is belief in community and responsibility. In Bob Dole
it has its rightful leader. His presidency would not only bury
the aberration that is the Clinton presidency, but would also
consolidate the conservative revolution.

<CENTER><B>William E. Dannemeyer on Bob Dornan</B></CENTER>
<P>
True leadership emanates from men who say the right thing at
the right time to the people who need to hear it most. This is
how I think of Bob Dornan. In my mind's eye I return to 1990,
on a typically hot and humid July morning in Washington, D.C.,
where a not-so-typical debate began to boil on the floor of the
House. 

<P>
At issue was the expulsion of Representative Barney Frank,
who had brought shame upon our institution for misjudgments involving
a male friend and prostitute over an 18-month period. As the sponsor
of the resolution to expel Frank, I can tell you that the experience
was one of the most intensely sobering dramas with which I was
ever involved in my 14 years of service in the House. It was not
a time for the timid. Only four members spoke in favor of the
expulsion. Bob Dornan was one of them. 

<P>
Bob began his comments,
&quot;I have not been this nervous in this well in over a 14-year
span in this House.&quot; And then he did something that has become
trademark Dornan, something only courageous men can do under fire.


<P>
Knowing that he stood virtually alone, knowing that ridicule and
contempt would be heaped upon him by Frank's defenders and a vicious
liberal media, Bob turned and looked Barney Frank square in the
eyes, not once turning his attention elsewhere, and said what
had to be said to the man who needed to hear it most: &quot;I
don't care about the details. The devil is in the details. That
is for you lawyers.&#133; I will vote for expelling you because
you did not have the honor or decency to resign.&quot; 

<P>
Bob Dole,
as inspirational as his life has been, would never have shown
such leadership. Phil Gramm would have become invisible. Dick
Lugar would have prayed that the moment would quickly pass. And
Arlen Specter would have defended Frank. Under those circumstances,
not one of these Republican candidates, who all serve in elective
office, would have done what needed to be done or have said what
needed to be said. This is a major reason why I support Bob Dornan
for president. 

<P>
Bob's conservatism is real. It is passionate. And
it is based on a deep and abiding faith in God. I was glad, although
not surprised, to hear Bob inject themes of liberty and virtue
into the presidential debate. Unlike the congressional colleagues
who have become his presidential competitors, Bob actually understands
the historical, moral, and philosophical basis of these themes.
He knows, and has stated, that we cannot be a free people unless
we are a virtuous people. He did not need million-dollar handlers
to tell him that. Nor did he need the incessant prodding of pro-family
special interests to motivate his comments. He knows the relationship
of liberty to virtue because he is a self-motivated student of
truth. 

<P>
History is one of Bob's closest friends. His life-long
relationship with history has honed his bubbling idealism into
a practical and balanced conservative philosophy. As a staunch
proponent of lower taxes and lower federal spending, Bob knows
the bounds of governmental authority, not only because he has
worn this mantle of authority over the last 18 years in Congress
but also because he has studiously examined history. From ancient
Rome to modern America, Bob Dornan knows what makes nations rise
and fall. The presidential rivals who serve with him in Congress
haven't got a clue. 

<P>
Bob Dornan is not the only good conservative
in this race for the presidency. Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes are
also running-and I count each as my friend. Even so, when I have
to choose, it is Bob Dornan I will support. Few other qualities
in a presidential candidate could offset a lack of elected public
service. Bob has been elected to Congress nine times, in Democratic
districts. These experiences have built character that cannot
be found anywhere else in politics.Moreover, Bob's record of service
both in and on behalf of the military is a nearly essential requirement
of the role of commander-in-chief. I know Bob feels it is an absolute
requirement. Through a variety of circumstances, he has witnessed
firsthand how America has influenced the world for good and has
developed the deepest appreciation for U.S. sovereignty. Bob Dornan
would not rush us off to war, nor would he abandon genuine freedom
fighters anywhere in the world. In determining this delicate balance,
I know he would excel-always erring on the cautious side in preserving
American lives and sovereignty. 

<P>
Bob Dornan belies the public persona
crafted and manipulated by an adversarial media elite. His passion
for life, his love of country, his deep commitment to his wife
Sallie and their children and grandchildren, and his uncanny identification
with all types of people sometimes make him an easy target for
mean-spirited and shallow adversaries. Yet he has remained eternally
optimistic about life and about the future of America specifically.
Great men deserve even greater opportunities to show their mettle.
This is why I unhesitatingly support Bob Dornan for president
of the United States of America.

<CENTER><B>Lewis E. Lehrman on Phil Gramm</B></CENTER>
<P>
Who is the authentic heir of the Reagan Revolution, the iron
man who can fulfill its promise? Who among us is the leader with
the compelling vision, the experience, and the perseverance to
lead us out of our time of troubles? I say I know such a man.


<P>
Born a son of the South, a grandson of Yankee immigrants, raised
in Georgia, and grown to manhood in Texas, he has risen to leadership
by virtue of his own remarkable energy and intelligence-just as
he rose to the rank of legislative statesman as the senior senator
from Texas. Phil Gramm is the man. 

<P>
Born poor, self-made, and unencumbered
by the cultural baggage of country-club Republicans, Phil Gramm's
life has demonstrated the promise of the American dream: that
every American, no matter how humble his beginnings, has the right
and the opportunity to rise by indefatigable effort and indisputable
merit as high as he might go. Phil Gramm will rise to the highest
office in the land because he will, conventional wisdom notwithstanding,
roll up the primaries in 1996. And he will win the general election
going away. 

<P>
This is how Phil Gramm will win! He will win with
the most compelling campaign of conservative ideas. He knows what
he believes and loves what he knows. He will win by recruiting
legions of true conservative activists to embrace his definition
of the American dream. He will win by the sheer force of his superior
talent and leadership, which explains why he has built more organization,
raised more money, and won over the vast majority of conservative
activists who know where he stands. 

<P>
Every true conservative who
aspires to the highest office should uphold a clear program of
reform designed to restore our limited constitutional government.
Yet we know, from the failures and disappointments of the past,
that a program by itself is not sufficient. Neither will it be
sufficient in 1996 to choose careerism or time-serving political
credentials. 

<P>
The conservatives now assembled for victory have
learned from hard experience that the man who leads us will only
be sufficient unto the task if he has, in addition to the gift
of intellect and a well-laid plan, something more. That something
is true grit, unimpeachable character, and the irrefragable tenacity
to carry his plan for a rebirth of the American dream to total
triumph. We the people want a president of the United States whose
impeccable conservative ideas and matchless record are joined
with a driving will to win. We want a winner, a big winner, a
man with a strategy for victory.

<P>
In the domain of political economy,
Phil Gramm is the best-trained, best-equipped presidential candidate
in American history. A free-market professor of economics long
before it was trendy, a co-author of the Reagan economic program,
he is the very apostle of low tax rates, a balanced budget, stable
money, and a deregulated economy. Phil Gramm is without peer in
his grasp of how to create full employment, long-term interest
rates of 4 percent, and a tax code based on a flat rate. 

<P>
In the
domain of defense policy, Phil Gramm has prepared himself for
the post-communist world. He has declared that he is &quot;ready
for a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb, and if
such a world comes about, I want the United States of America
to be that lion.&quot; No other policy is acceptable to Phil Gramm,
whose presidential inaugural oath, registered in heaven, will
require him to &quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution
of the United States of America.&quot; 

<P>
Believing as I do that
economics and foreign policy are contingent, but cultural and
social principles are central, what assurance does one have that
President Gramm will encourage and foster the indispensable moral
reformation of the public square? Speaking in May before Liberty
University and The Heritage Foundation, Phil Gramm said: &quot;Faith
and family produced the values and virtues that helped make America
the world's greatest and most powerful nation long before we had
any of the trappings of greatness and power.&quot; Quoting Alexis
de Tocqueville, Gramm said, &quot;'Not until I went into the churches
of America, and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did
I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great
because she is good, and if America ever ceased to be good, America
will cease to be great.' I believe that Alexis de Tocqueville
was right 160 years ago, and I believe he is right today.&quot;


<P>
In more specific terms, Gramm has argued that &quot;the social-security
net that we erected has become a hammock. Government programs&#133;have
changed the way we behave, corrupted our values, and diminished
our virtue. As we look more and more towards Caesar to take care
of us, we have turned more and more away from family and faith.
In rendering unto Caesar, we have stopped rendering unto God.&quot;


<P>
And thus we are brought to consider the soul of the Republican
Party as we debate its presidential nomination. During the greatest
crisis of American history, the Republican Party of the United
States was founded on the everlasting covenant of &quot;free soil,
free men, and free labor.&quot; And with the victory of our party
and of President Lincoln came vindication of the inalienable right
to liberty and the end of slavery in America. More than a century
later, the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan came to stand for
many things, but there was one unique covenant in the platforms
of 1980 and 1984. Let us call it the one needful thing. And what
is that thing? Senator Gramm described &quot;the day when all
unborn children are welcomed into life and loved when they get
here.&quot; A Republican Party-indeed, a Republican president-without
a commitment to the inalienable right to life, without unequivocal
opposition to abortion, is as unthinkable as a Republican Party
without Lincoln, the inalienable right to liberty, and unequivocal
opposition to slavery. 

<P>
We conservatives know that, after this
imminent contest for the presidency, our philosophical agenda
entails no less than the comprehensive reformation of our political
institutions. But to pursue a goal without the right man and the
right means to attain it is to court political disaster. Republicans
are blessed with several authentic candidates. But I believe that
Phil Gramm is the only leader with the intellect, the force of
will, and the preparation for greatness who can marshall our forces
for an overwhelming and irreversible victory over our foes.

<CENTER><B>Mary Parker Lewis onAlan Keyes</B></CENTER>
<P>
For the millions of Americans who are brokenhearted over the
decay of moral standards, the disintegration of families and neighborhoods,
and the slaughter of innocents in the womb, Alan Keyes is the
most powerful spokesman on the scene today. More than any other
candidate, Alan Keyes offers a healing message of hope and renewal,
based on the immortal principles of our great Declaration of Independence,
and delivered without apology to the better angels of our nature.


<P>
The former president of Citizens Against Government Waste, Alan
Keyes offers credentials second to none as a champion of Americans
fed up with overtaxation, overspending, and overregulation. For
example, when many Republican leaders were assuring us that Dick
Darman's 1990 budget deal was a winner for George Bush and the
GOP, Alan warned that the agreement would prove disastrous for
taxpayers, the economy, and the party. Events proved him right.


<P>
Today the GOP endorses the policies of tax reduction, spending
restraint, and local empowerment that Alan has championed for
years. That is well and good. But as Alan eloquently reminds Republican
audiences, economics is not at the heart of what ails America.
Serious though they are, our economic problems are largely derivative,
the consequences of having abandoned the moral and constitutional
principles of the American founding. The transfer state is bankrupting
America, but the transfer state comes into its own only when hordes
of people see nothing wrong with living off the toil of others.
In any event, moral vices produce the social problems for which
government programs are inevitably proffered as solutions. 

<P>
That's
why Alan's front-and-center emphasis on moral issues is the only
genuinely practical approach. Consider these words from his February
19 address to the New Hampshire Republican State Committee: &quot;Why
is it that we spend so much money on welfare and illegitimacy?
Why is it that we spend so much money on crime and violence in
our streets? Why is it even that we spend so much money dealing
with the problems of irresponsible behavior that contribute to
the decline of the health of this nation? I think you all know
in your hearts what the real answer is. We don't have money problems,
we have moral problems. And it's time we stood up and faced that
truth.&quot; We will never succeed in relimiting the federal government
until we restore the family to its rightful place as the first
and best &quot;welfare provider&quot; and strengthen the marriage-based,
two-parent family as the fundamental moral unit of society. 

<P>
Of
all the policies eroding the moral foundations of family life
and American freedom, the policy of abortion on demand poses the
greatest danger. There are, of course, many decent people on both
sides of the abortion controversy. Nonetheless, the pro-abortion
position is anti-family. As an institution, the family both depends
upon and nurtures an ethic of duty and self-sacrifice. But the
pro-abortion position fosters an ethic of self-indulgence. It
says, in effect, that the convenience or pleasure of the adult
is the supreme law. 

<P>
Worse, the pro-abortion position implicitly
justifies political despotism. The Declaration of Independence
proclaims the right to life to be a gift from God and, therefore,
inalienable. The pro-abortion argument assumes either that government
(not God) is the source of rights, or that we have the right to
decide whose humanity shall be recognized and whose shall not.
Obviously, the doctrine that there are no natural rights (hence
no natural wrongs) advances the ambitions of those whose chief
interest lies in the expansion of government power. But liberty
is also subverted when we claim the authority to decide who among
us is human, and who is not. Alan put it this way in an April
8 speech to Delaware Republicans: 

<P>
&quot;Don't you realize that
opens the door to every form of tyranny? Because all I have to
do if I want to snuff out your life or trample on your rights
is decide that you're not human. And of course you'll look at
me and say, 'But you can't do that.' And I'll say, 'Well, the
last time the American people decided they were going to draw
the line, my folks ended up on the wrong side of it.' And I don't
think it was because we had the poor judgment to draw the line
in the wrong place. I think it was because we claimed a right
we do not have. We do not have the right to draw that line. God
drew it, and all we have the right to do is respect His will.&quot;


<P>
Slavery and abortion on demand are both what Alan calls &quot;Declaration
issues&quot;-moral wrongs that must be addressed because they
contradict the basic premise of a self-governing polity. I believe
Alan sees so deeply into the nature of the abortion controversy
because he has thought long and hard about slavery and the black
experience in America. 

<P>
Keyes's book, <I>Masters of the Dream:
The Strength and Betrayal of Black America</I>, is not just an
antidote to decades of left-wing revisionism. It is a meditation
on the universal significance of the black experience-the moral
and civic lessons to be learned therefrom. Slavery did not make
blacks slavish, nor did material deprivation turn them into passive
victims. Rather, slavery whetted their natural thirst for freedom,
much as it did to the Hebrews of old. Deprivation taught them
to recognize the true, non-material basis of human dignity. To
survive in the face of adversity, blacks had to become diligent,
dependable, hopeful. They learned to honor hard work, self-discipline,
family, and the riches of the spirit. Such qualities of moral
and spiritual strength are the key to restoring the true American
dream-the dream of freedom. 

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, black America
was betrayed by the same forces that are destroying the dream
for all Americans: the perverse incentives of the transfer state,
and the debilitating doctrines of sexual permissiveness and moral
relativism. Alan Keyes's candidacy is a candidacy like no other.
Drawing on the moral lessons of black history, the imperishable
truths of the Declaration, and the arts of statesmanship, Alan
Keyes will elevate the 1996 presidential contest to a plane not
seen in America since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

<CENTER><B>MitchellE. Daniels Jr. on Richard Lugar</B></CENTER>
<P>
 As they search for the best national leader in 1996, conservatives
should look beyond words, votes, and even public actions. The
true measure of authenticity must encompass not only what a man
has shown to the camera, but also what he has shown to his family,
his neighbors, and his Maker. For Dick Lugar, conservatism is
not merely a school of thought, it is a way of life, and it is
in that context that he emerges as the right man to lead America
back to strength and virtue. 

<P>
By every conventional yardstick,
Dick Lugar has been a rock of conservative principle and consistency.
As the mayor of Indianapolis, he cut taxes five times in eight
years, and battled tirelessly against federal intrusion into state
and local autonomy. As a senator, he has amassed a voting record
in the most conservative fifth of each Congress in which he has
served; statistically, he was Ronald Reagan's number-one supporter
for the eight years of the 40th presidency. 

<P>
Lugar's campaign for
the presidency is animated by these same bedrock beliefs. His
determination to shrink government and reduce spending is confirmed
by his ongoing, often lonely battle to cut agricultural subsidies
and free American farmers to plant for the market, not the government.
Like Churchill, he believes that &quot;The responsibility of Ministers
for the public safety is absolute and requires no mandate. It
is in fact the prime object for which governments come into existence.&quot;
He knows, and is unafraid to state, that the safety of our country
cannot be left to chance, but will demand American activism on
nuclear proliferation, ballistic-missile defense, and terrorism.


<P>
Dick Lugar rejects the current establishment's constrained vision
of a U.S. economy growing at only 2 or 3 percent per year. His
clarion call to abolish all taxation of enterprise is the single
most radical and promising idea on the 1996 agenda. Alone among
the candidates' reform proposals, it would uproot today's entire
anti-growth, anti-savings regime of income, capital-gains, and
estate taxation, and turn loose a 1980s-like explosion of investment,
exports, jobs, and higher incomes. 

<P>
But for all its macroeconomic
appeal, the true significance of the Lugar tax plan lies in its
underlying values. Leapfrogging the flat tax and its imitators,
Lugar would abolish at a stroke the most dehumanizing aspects
of modern statism: the invasions of privacy, the abuses of power,
the insidious invisibility of withholding, and the unspoken assumption
that income belongs to the state rather than the individual. Through
their consumption decisions, individuals would have full control
of the rate of their taxation. In a real sense, Dick Lugar's tax
plan is the ultimate expression of conservative philosophy. 

<P>Anyone
can write a platform. Many have compiled positive records of words,
votes, and public deeds. It is the rarest of public men who can
also lead a life in complete congruence with the principles he
espouses. 

<P>
Dick Lugar has lived the virtues of self-discipline,
duty, devotion to country, and religious faith that we all admire
but practice imperfectly. He was first in his class in high school,
first in his class at college; he has been a Methodist lay minister,
and an Eagle Scout. Like Bill Clinton, Dick Lugar visited the
American Embassy in London while he was a Rhodes Scholar; unlike
Clinton, Lugar went there to enlist in the U.S. Navy. 

<P>
Lugar served
his country with distinction, including a stint as intelligence
briefer to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the chief of naval operations.
Returning to his home town, he saved a struggling family manufacturing
business, carried on the family farming operations, and with Charlene,
his wife (and co-president of their college's student body), built
his own little platoon of four sons. As a school-board member,
he fought for racial integration and against forced busing. That
brought him to the public's attention, and eventually to an elective
career. But throughout his public life, he has remained closely
involved in both his businesses. Dick Lugar has always been a
citizen legislator. 

<P>
When President Lugar calls Americans to reassert
the moral superiority of hard work, personal responsibility, intact
families, and respect for life, his conviction will not be drawn
merely from congressional testimony of the latest policy analysis.
His leadership of a cultural recovery in our country will be grounded
in a life of commitment to virtues early learned and deep embedded.


<P>
The conservative revolution is yet to be won. Building upon the
congressional breakthrough of 1994 will require the election of
a Republican president, and not just any Republican will do. Total
triumph will only be won by a president who can attract and hold
the respect and affection of millions of citizens. 

<P>
Dick Lugar's
brand of inclusive, reasoned, friendly conservatism has allowed
him to build larger coalitions and shatter electoral records throughout
his career. Just as he is the candidate most certain to disarm
President Clinton in a general election, he is the man best equipped
to win the enduring trust of the larger majorities whose support
will consummate the conservative crusade.

<CENTER><B>Roger J. Stone
Jr. on Arlen Specter</B></CENTER>
<P>
Arlen Specter is a Jew, he comes from a big city, he has a record
of commitment to racial equality (without quotas), he's pro-choice,
and he believes strongly in tolerance and the First Amendment
doctrine of church-state separation. For social-issue conservatives
who take their marching orders from Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,
who believe in Pat Buchanan's &quot;holy war&quot; for the soul
of America, some or all of these factors probably make Specter's
candidacy anathema. Frankly, this article is not addressed to
them. 

<P>
The conservatives to whom this article is addressed are
conservatives like myself-the kind of conservatives I met in 1964
as a member of Young Americans for Freedom, fighting the good
fight for Barry Goldwater; the conservatives I led as National
Chairman of Young Republicans, and worked with beginning in 1976,
and then in 1980 and 1984, to give America eight magnificent years
of a Ronald Reagan presidency; and the supply-side conservatives
I worked with in Jack Kemp's 1988 presidential campaign in an
effort to continue that tradition. 

<P>
This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Barry Goldwater, believe that government
ought to get off our backs, keep out of our pocketbooks, and stay
out of our bedrooms. This article is addressed to conservatives
who, like Ronald Reagan, believe in a strong America: strong enough
militarily to secure our interests and keep the peace around the
world, strong enough domestically to win the war against drugs
and violent crime on our streets. This article is addressed to
conservatives who, like Jack Kemp, believe in an American future
of unlimited economic opportunity and unprecedented growth fueled
by low taxes, free trade, and free markets. 

<P>
To those libertarian
conservatives, who I believe are the true core of American conservatism,
I say Arlen Specter is your candidate. In Arlen Specter, you will
find a senator with a strong record of conservatism that goes
back to his first days in the senate. In the Specter '96 campaign,
you will find a program thoroughly grounded in conservative ideals
and ideas, and a candidate committed to fiscal and economic conservatism
who has the best chance of beating Bill Clinton in a general election.


<P>
First, the Specter record. Arlen Specter came to the Senate in
1981 with an outstanding background in law enforcement as Philadelphia's
district attorney, where he fought successfully to end plea bargaining
and win stiff sentences for violent criminals. In the Senate,
he immediately made tough anticrime policies a legislative priority,
and authored the 1984 Armed Career Criminal bill, the first federal
law to use &quot;three strikes&quot; to get long-term jail terms
for repeat offenders. A strong believer in the deterrent force
of the death penalty, Arlen Specter has for 15 years been the
driving force in Congress to put teeth back into state death-penalty
laws by eliminating ridiculous judicial delays in carrying out
death sentences. 

<P>
Throughout the Reagan presidency, Arlen Specter
was a solid supporter of the revitalization of the American military,
including the Strategic Defense Initiative. He firmly opposed
any effort to relax the Cuban embargo. He has been at the forefront
of the fight to combat terrorism at home and abroad, and was a
leading Senate voice in support of the Gulf War resolution. Recently,
he has been a vocal Senate force in opposition to the Clinton
administration's appeasement of North Korea and its pointless
risk of U.S. lives in Haiti. 

<P>
Specter's fiscal record in the Senate
is solidly conservative: long-time support for both a balanced
budget amendment and the line-item veto (including sponsoring
his own legislation during his second term); support for the Reagan
era tax cuts; and, early this year,his own flat-tax bill-the Senate's
only such legislation.

<P>
For the same reasons that Specter has opposed
government interference into Americans' private lives, he has
always opposed gun-control and supported the rights of law-abiding
citizens to own firearms. He believes that swift, certain, and
severe punishment of criminals, not confiscation of guns from
the public, is the effective way to fight violent crime.

<P>
The defining
themes of the Specter '96 campaign are squarely conservative.
As Arlen Specter said in announcing his candidacy last March:
    
<P>
&quot;With the election of a Republican Congress in 1994 and
a Republican president in 1996, we have a unique opportunity to
move America toward unprecedented prosperity and unlimited opportunity....


<P>
&quot;We do so by implementing our core Republican values: smaller
government; less spending; lower taxes; civil rights and liberties;
strong national defense; and effective crime control.&#133; I
stand before you today as a man willing to work with every ounce
of my energy and every fiber of my determination to renew once
again the dreams of freedom and opportunity that for 200 years
have made this nation the envy of and the example for the world.&quot;


<P>
In his announcement speech, Specter made just two specific pledges
on domestic policy, and both reflect the fundamentally conservative
orientation of his governing philosophy: to balance the budget
by 2002 (and to write the first check to reduce the national debt
in January, 2003); and to deliver a flat-tax bill to the Congress
at his own inauguration. 

<P>
The flat-tax concept-a single 20 percent
tax rate on all business and personal income, elimination of all
loopholes and deductions except for a portion of home-mortgage
interest and small charitable contributions, and no taxation on
interest, dividends, and capital gains-has become the economic
centerpiece of the Specter campaign. As welcome as specific tax
cuts might be, they are mere Band-Aids for a tax system that is
long on bureaucrats, rules, and regulations and short on incentives
for economic growth. The future of conservative fiscal policy
lies with the flat tax-House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the
next president would be elected on a flat-tax platform-and Arlen
Specter is the only Republican candidate to commit foursquare
to such a system. 

<P>
Conservatives need to be realists. We need to
recognize that Bill Clinton is not as vulnerable as he once seemed
or as we might like. The 1996 Republican nominee will face in
Bill Clinton an energetic campaigner, a president determined to
use the considerable powers of incumbency in support of his re&euml;lection,
and a man zealously supported by interest groups determined to
retain their last link to political power. As conservatives, we
need a Republican nominee who can defeat Bill Clinton in a general
election-and that means Arlen Specter. 

<P>
Since 1980, Arlen Specter
has won three tough Senate races (and two tough primaries) in
a bellwether state where Democrats have always far outnumbered
Republicans. In 1992, despite the fury of radical feminists over
his defense of Clarence Thomas, Specter carried Pennsylvania by
three points while George Bush was losing the state to Clinton
by a million votes. Arlen Specter has a reputation as an indefatigable
campaigner-a reputation I can tell you is well deserved. He has
the intellect, tenacity, and toughness to take on Bill Clinton
in a presidential debate-and to win going away. 

<P>
In Arlen Specter,
conservatives have the chance to support a candidate committed
to a balanced budget and a flat tax at home, and to the restoration
of American strength, resolve, and credibility abroad; a candidate
who has the knowledge and experience to lead a national war on
crime and drugs; and a candidate who can win the White House on
these issues. Conservatives who see themselves as heir to the
libertarian legacy of Barry Goldwater, the Reagan tradition of
American strength abroad and limited government at home, and the
Kemp commitment to broad-based growth and prosperity belong in
his camp.

<P>
Today the commonsense conservative philosophy that so many have
fought for, for so long, holds sway in the Supreme Court, in the
U.S. Senate, and in the House of Representatives. There is only
one piece missing in the conservative political jigsaw puzzle-the
White House. When that piece is in place, a picture of real political
revolution will emerge, a revolution that could roll on well into
the next century.

<P>
That is why the stakes next year are so high.

<P>
There
have been three successful conservative Republican presidents
elected in our lifetimes-Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon,
and Ronald Reagan. I've worked to help elect and then serve with
two of them, and I believe there are certain requirements that
a person must have to win the Republican nomination and then the
presidency.   

<P>Here's the short list:
<UL>
<LI>They must have rock-solid
conservative views on national security and economic policy, and
they must be in accord on a wide range of social issues important
to the conservative base of the Republican party.
<LI>They must
be political warhorses, with a powerful political base-preferably
California (54 electoral votes), New York (33 votes), or Texas
(32 votes)-and skilled campaigners. Executive experience in government
is a big plus.
<LI>They must have high intelligence, great stamina,
and a record free of scandal. Running for president against any
incumbent Democrat, in the teeth of a hostile, liberal press,
is a mind-numbing, exhausting gauntlet. 
</UL>

<P>
The Republican candidates
running for president in 1996 are a distinguished group; any one
of them would be a dramatic improvement over President Clinton.
By the fall of 1995, it is likely that the race will narrow to
three men: Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, and Governor Wilson. They
are all good men, but I believe that one of them-Pete Wilson-best
meets the criteria for getting nominated, getting elected, and
governing successfully. 

<P>
<B>Peace and National Security.</B> Pete Wilson
has a strong, consistent record of conservative positions on national
defense and foreign policy. Known as a national defense hawk in
the U.S. Senate, he was a leading supporter of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and one of the few who called
for early deployment. An expert on strategic nuclear policy and
arms control he was a critic of the SALT II treaty and backed
President Reagan's INF treaty.  

<P>
As governor, he has been an outspoken
critic of President Clinton for squandering U.S. prestige and
influence around the world and cutting national defense spending
to dangerously low levels. 

<P>
In the 1950s, he was a platoon leader
in the U.S. Marines. On national-defense matters, they don't come
any tougher than former U.S. Marine officers. On national security,
Pete Wilson is as tough a defender of U.S. interests as any Republican
running. 

<P>
<B>Prosperity and Economic Policy.</B> As a U.S. Senator, he
consistently supported both a constitutional amendment to balance
the federal budget, and line-item veto authority for the president.
As a candidate for the Senate, he strongly opposed the 1982 tax
increase; and as senator, he voted against President Bush's 1990
tax increase. 

<P>
When he became the governor of California in 1991,
he inherited the worst economic mess in the state's history. The
deficit facing him was one third of the state's general fund request,
comparable to a $500 billion deficit in today's federal budget,
but with one big difference-the California constitution mandates
a balanced budget. Unlike Washington, where you can take seven
years to achieve fiscal responsibility, he only had one year and
a legislature controlled by Democrats. Although some taxes were
raised, the lion's share of that deficit was eliminated by tough
spending control. 

<P>
In fact, during the four years of his first
term he held spending flat in current dollars. If you account
for inflation, real spending went down-not from some bogus baseline
projection, but from actual 1991 spending levels. If the federal
government had exercised comparable toughness, the federal budget
would be in balance today. 

<P>
California also went through a few
other trials-drastic defense-industry cutbacks, the collapse of
real-estate values, fires, floods, mudslides, riots, and earthquakes.
But Pete Wilson's tough spending control, unmatched in any other
state, laid the foundation for a strong economic recovery that
confounded the experts-a recovery strong enough to generate sufficient
new tax revenues to pay off temporary debts, to fund spending
increases for education and law enforcement, and to propose a
15 percent across-the-board tax cut for all individuals and businesses.
If the Democratic-controlled legislature refuses to pass the tax
cut, Pete Wilson has vowed to hold a statewide ballot referendum
and let the voters decide. When passed, the new tax rates will
be below what they were when he took office. 

<P>
Pete Wilson is the
only Republican candidate proposing a true supply-side tax cut-not
increased deductions or exemptions, but an across-the-board reduction
in tax rates. 

<P>Speaking to the Republican Midwest Leadership Conference
on May 19, 1995, he spelled out the Reagan supply-side formula
for economic prosperity: &quot;If we both cut taxes and cut spending...there
is every reason for not just optimism but for justified confidence
in America's dynamic growth.&quot; 

<P>
<B>Justice and Social Issues.</B>
Here his record is overwhelmingly on the side of conservative
values, a clear sense of what is right and wrong, and of achieving
justice. Pete Wilson, the governor of our largest state, took
the lead not only in reforming welfare, but also in actually cutting
the amount of benefits paid. He was the first political leader
to sound the alarm on the injustice of paying billions of taxpayers'
dollars for the welfare, medical care, and education expenses
of illegal aliens. He led the battle for &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; for career criminals, locking them up for life
after their third felony conviction. 

<P>
A supporter of term limits
for politicians and the kind of federalism the Founding Fathers
intended for the United States, he has led the fight against the
heavy hand of federal mandates, declaring that California is &quot;not
a colony of the federal government.&quot; 

<P>
He has fought for regulatory
and legal reform, proposed a state constitutional amendment to
limit regulatory excesses, and issued an executive order suspending
the environmental regulations that contributed to the recent flood
damage. He has consistently vetoed legislation that would extend
special rights to gays, while opposing measures that would discriminate
against them. Pete Wilson, an expert pistol shot when he served
in the Marine Corps, has always supported the fundamental Second
Amendment rights of Americans to keep and bear arms, subject only
to some commonsense restrictions that support law enforcement.
On affirmative action, he has called for commonsense justice-a
color-blind society in which people would be treated equally regardless
of race or gender. 

<P>
On the social issue that most troubles the
Republican party today-abortion-Pete Wilson holds strong, consistent
views. While fully aware of the deeply held beliefs of those who
oppose all abortion and the reasoning behind those beliefs, he
has also carefully considered the rights and responsibilities
of the individuals involved, and the dangers of allowing an already
too powerful federal government to intrude itself into the most
intimate, difficult decision a woman can make. He strongly believes
we should encourage the kind of responsibility that would make
abortion unnecessary, that the question of abortion is best left
to the family and church, and that we should try to remove this
issue from the political arena to the extent possible. 

<P>
Is this
conservative? Well, it is the position shared by a substantial
majority of the Republican Party. Considering the terrible moral
dilemmas involved, it is a commonsense conservative view. 

<P>
<B>Electability.</B>
Most of my conservative friends are primarily interested in ideas
and principles, but for those who are also concerned with mundane
things like winning elections and taking power, I have a final
thought. 

<P>
If Pete Wilson wins the Republican nomination in 1996,
he will win the 54 electoral votes of California in the general
election. No Democratic nominee can be elected president without
winning California. 

<P>
Therefore, the nomination of Pete Wilson is
as close to a guarantee as you can get that Republicans   will-for
the first time in 44 years-control both houses of the Congress
and the White House. 

<P>If that happens, well then, as Ronald Reagan
once said: &quot;You ain't seen nothin' yet.&quot;

<p>
A generation has passed since the Nixon administration established racial quotas in hiring, promotion, college admissions, and government contracting. Affirmative-action policies, both public and private, have opened many economic and educational opportunities for Afri-can Americans, and have played an important role in one of the most encouraging developments of recent decades: the emergence of a large and growing black middle class. But supporters of government-mandated racial preferences have always been uncomfortable about policies that judge Americans by the color of their skin, not the content of their characterthe opposite of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. Even if racial preferences have been justified on a temporary basis, they surely cannot be justified for more than a generation.<p>
Citizens and politicians are beginning to roll quotas back. Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm both have promised that, if elected president, they would repeal President Nixon's executive order requiring all government contractors to submit detailed "goals and timetables" for the hiring and promotion of minorities and women. Governor Pete Wilson has abolished some racial hiring quotas established by California law. Even President Clinton is reviewing the issue. <p>
Perhaps the most dramatic movement is the California Civil Rights Initiative, which will be on the ballot next year and enjoys overwhelming support in public-opinion polls. The brainchild of two scholars, Glynn Custred and Thomas Wood, the initiative is based on the color-blind language of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: "Neither the State of California nor any of its political subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group in the operation of the State's system of public employment, public education or public contracting."<p><center><b>Gaining Ground</center></b>
<p>
There are six reasons why the repeal of government-mandated racial quotas is gaining the support of the American people:<ul>
<li>
Racial preferences are discriminatory. It is just as wrong for the government to discriminate in favor of blacks and other minorities as it is to discriminate against them. Preferring one race to another is a violation of the Declaration of Independence, which holds that all men are created equal; of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees all citizens the equal protection of the laws; and of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which explicitly forbids government-mandated reverse discrimination. This discrimination has real victims, such as the Asians denied admission to the University of California in spite of spectacular records, and would-be policemen and firemen who lose jobs to applicants who are substantially less qualified.<li>
Racial preferences violate the principles of American citizenship. Americans come from all races, all religions, all nationalities. What unites us as a nation is not a common origin, but a common commitment to our political institutions: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the Constitution; a self-governing republic. Martin Luther King Jr. brought Americans togetherby speaking of what Americans have in common, by showing how the civil-rights movement fit into the American political tradition. Racial preferences do the opposite; they balkanize our country by emphasizing our differences.<li>
Racial preferences foster dependency on government. Ronald Reagan used to say that "the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare." So, too, the success of affirmative action should be judged by how many businesses become independent of set-asides, by how many individuals become independent of quotas in promotion and hiring. Unfortunately, all too many businesses have become part of a permanent affirmative-action industry.<li>
Racial preferences restrict freedom. Much of the creativity of a market economy comes from the freedom that individuals and businesses have to discover and use information. Bureaucratic, highly regulated affirmative-action policies endanger this creativity by denying businesses the freedom to hire and fire whomever they wish, and, in the case of employment tests that are forbidden because they have a disparate impact on races, by interfering with the free flow of information.<li>
Racial preferences fail to address the central challenge facing black America today: integrating poor black males into the American mainstream. The number of black men in college has fallen behind even as affirmative-action preferences in college admissions have intensified: There are now only 540,000 African-American men in college, compared with 830,000 black women. The explosion of violent crime by young black men wasn't supposed to happen with affirmative action. Something drastically different must be done instead of racial preferences, or a generation of black men will be destroyed.<li>
Most perniciously, racial preferences lower standards and expectations. When African Americans and Hispanics are held to a lower standard than members of other groups, the implicit message is patronizing, even racist. The signal sent by different treatment is that African Americans and Hispanics cannot compete on their own, unless they are given a special handicap. To make matters worse, the very idea of standards is devalued in the culture of affirmative action, where a test is considered discriminatory if blacks and Hispanics don't score well. </ul>
<p>
It is no accident that the two institutions in which blacks have advanced the most rapidly in America, the military and athletics, are meritocracies with clear performance standards. Colin Powell did not become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the outstanding generals in American history by receiving special treatment in his performance reviews. The military, it is frequently said, is the only institution in America in whichblacks regularly give orders to whites. This is because blackss in the armed forces have been given standards to aspire to, and the opportunity to achieve them.<p>
By contrast, public schools in America set tragically low academic expectations for poor children, especially for blacks and Hispanics. The culture of affirmative action reinforces these low expectations, with a defeatist message that minorities can't make the grade, and that standards don't even really matter. The sad fact is that on average blacks and Hispanics do score poorly on standardized academic tests. But that isn't an indictment of the tests; it's an indictment of the school system and surrounding culture that discourage kids from achieving.<p>
The literature of education is filled with stories of rapid academic advances by blacks and Hispanics in the face of higher expectations. Over the objections of fellow teachers and guidance counselors who said "these kids can't learn," Jaime Escalante turned Garfield High School, located in a working-class Mexican-American neighborhood of East Los Angeles, into one of the country's top advanced-placement calculus schools. Black and Hispanic freshmen in Georgia Tech's engineering program outperform whites, thanks to a rigorous orientation program based on immersion in math and chemistry.<p>
In New York City, the number of black ninth-graders passing the New York State Regents' science exam doubled from 6,000 in 1994 to nearly 13,000 in 1995, while the number of Hispanics passing the test tripled from 3,000 to over 10,000. The difference? In 1995, at the insistence of New York City School Chancellor Ramon Cortines, black and Hispanic students were expected to take Regents-level science courses and succeed in them. Prior to that, they were expected to fail.<p>
Expectations make all the difference for modest levels of achievement as well. During the early 1980s, Florida established a functional literacy test as a criterion of high-school graduation. Florida schools now give diplomas only to students who pass a test measuring whether they can fill out basic job application forms, do basic kinds of comparison shopping, balance check books, and otherwise participate in a modern society. At first, 80 to 90 percent of black 12th-graders failed. The test was challenged in court by the Legal Services Corp. on the grounds that it was discriminatory. But Florida gives students five chances to sit for the exam, and 90 percent of black 12th-graders now get passing scores. Those graduates are much better off for being forced to achieve a minimum level of competency.<p><b><center>The Best Affirmative Action</b></center>
<p>
The best affirmative action offers opportunities to outsiders without lowering standards and expectations. This means holding the members of all races to the same high standard and, if necessary, giving people the extra training they need to make the grade. It means not reserving particular jobs for blacks. It means making a genuine effort to find African Americansand other Americans of all raceswho might be overlooked but who have the capacity to excel. This is frequently a judgment call, for the capacity to excel is determined by leadership ability, strength of character, intellectual creativity, and other attributes that can't be easily measured by standardized tests. Precisely because it is a judgment call, it does not lend itself to bureaucratic oversight in the form of quotas, goals, or timetables.<p>
The nomination of Clarence Thomas as associate justice of the Supreme Court is a wonderful example of this judgment. President Bush and his advisers sensed that Thomas, though he did not yet have much judicial experience, had the constitutional understanding, the moral courage, and the intellect to become a distinguished judgeand also to become a national hero among conservative blacks in the way that Justice Thurgood Marshall was a national hero among liberals. As a result of Thomas's race, President Bush may have looked at his qualities more closely than he otherwise would have at that stage in the judge's career. But it was Thomas's qualities, not his race, that led to the nomination. There was no lowering of standards. On the contrary, the  Thomas nomination is now seen, at least by conservatives, as Bush's most significant enduring domestic-policy achievement.<p>
Americans of all races can take pride in the growing leadership of African Americans in political, economic, and cultural life. It is one of the great success stories of American history, rivaling the stories of the pioneers, of immigrants, of inventors and entrepreneurs. It is a quintessential American story of determined people overcoming hardship to make the most of our blessings of liberty.<p>
Government-imposed racial preferences played an important part in this story, by smashing through the institutional barriers to black advancement that were the legacy of centuries of discrimination. But reverse discrimination was always a questionable remedy to earlier prejudice. By failing now to offer opportunity to poor black males, racial preferences have outlived whatever usefulness they may have had. It is time for them to go.

<p>
Big Government was consolidated in America in the First Hundred Days of the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. By promising that the House would enact the Contract With America in the First Hundred Days of the 104th Congress, Speaker Newt Gingrich deliberately invited the history books to compare the work of the House Republican leadership with the New Deal of FDR.<p>
Policy Review asked nine students of American politics to assess the historic significance of Gingrich's First Hundred Days, and the principal achievements and errors of the House Republican leadership during this "rendezvous with destiny."<p>
<center><b>John J. Pitney, Jr.</center></b><p>
At first glance, it seems that the House GOP's First Hundred Days compare badly with FDR's. Although all the items in the Contract With America reached the House floor, only two of them (congressional compliance and unfunded mandates) became law before the hundredth day. By contrast, FDR signed bushels of bills during the Hundred Days of 1933. His emergency banking measure went through introduction, passage, and signature on the very first day of the congressional sessionand in less than eight hours.<p>
It is unfair, however, to judge today's House Republicans by the Roosevelt standard. Crisis is the great lubricant of the legislative process, and the economic calamities of FDR's early days briefly suspended Capitol Hill's normal friction. And odd as it may sound, many aspects of public life actually moved faster in 1933 than in 1995. Take justice, for instance. Shortly before FDR took office, a man named Giuseppe Zangara fired five shots at the president-elect, missing him but killing one person and wounding four others. Zangara was tried, convicted, and executed within 33 days. In the 1990s, jury selection alone can take longer than that, and capital offenders can stay out of the electric chair for years by filing endless habeas corpus petitions.<p>
Government has become tangled in its own red tapewhich is precisely why the Republicans put so much emphasis on procedural reform. They started with the House itself, recognizing that the institution would work more efficiently with fewer committees and smaller staffs. The best symbol of their commitment to renewing Congress came with the congressional-compliance bill, which cleared both chambers faster than any peacetime domestic legislation since Roosevelt's banking bill in 1933. In other ways, the Republicans strove to make government leaner and less cumbersome. Proposals such as block grants would eliminate layers of bureaucracy and miles of red tape. And the GOP crime bill would restore rationality to the appeals process in capital cases, thereby ensuring swift justice for the Zangaras of the future.<p>House Republicans are pushing the federal government to match the pace of 62 years ago. Ironically, that is high praise.<p>
<i>John J. Pitney, Jr., an associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, is the co-author of Congress' Permanent Minority? Republicans in the U.S. House.</I>
<p><center><b>William A. Rusher</center></b>
<p>
The First Hundred Days of the new House Republican leaders will deserve that well-worn adjective "historic" even if relatively few of the measures listed in their Contract With America ever become law in a form they would recognize. For the central achievement of the First Hundred Days was to change the whole terrain and direction of American politics.<p>
Last year, the most that could be conceived, let alone hoped for, in the field of tax reform was a modest reduction in the rate of income taxation. Todaywhether or not major changes occur in the first session of the 104th Congressthe serious talk among congressional leaders is about imposing a flat tax, or even tearing up the tax code by the roots and replacing the income tax with a broad-based tax on consumption.<p>
Similarly, "welfare reform" in 1994 meant, at best, doing a little nipping and tucking on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Today, the entire burden of administering most of the nation's huge welfare programs is on its way back to the 50 individual states, along with block grants to finance it.<p>
And so it went, in one field after another, from unfunded mandates to the line-item veto; this new House of Representatives has dared to think and act in ways that have simply transformed the paradigms of American politics. It remains true that "politics is the art of the possible," but a huge number of new possibilities has opened up.<p>
Whether the First Hundred Days of this House will ultimately deserve comparison to the First Hundred Days of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency depends upon how successful the Republicans are in setting their initiatives in concrete, as the New Dealers managed to set theirs. At this writing, and probably for several years to come, it is simply too early to tell. Much depends on how the voters react in November 1996, when they will, with their votes, make their first and perhaps most important comment on the Republican performance. Almost as crucial, however, will be the way in which future Republican presidents and Congresses follow up on the achievements of the 104th.<p>
Any major mistakes? Yes, one: The failure to anticipate and prepare for the Democrats' counterattack, based on the tired old charge that Republicans want to starve America's children and stuff the money into the pockets of the rich. Don't be fooled by the sheer implausibility of such an accusationa big enough lie will be believed, by a small but often crucial percentage of the voters, if it isn't nailed promptly and repeatedly by spokesmen whom the media cannot ignore. (Note how disastrously the Bush administration let the liberals rewrite the whole history of the 1980s.) We may yet pay dearly for the Republican party's sloth in this regard.<p>

<p><center><b>Burton W. Folsom Jr.</center></b>
<p>
The House Republican Leadership did most of what it said it would do in the Contract With America. The result was a remarkable legislative flurry that largely fulfilled the campaign promises that so many Republicans made during the 1994 elections.<p>
How do we compare this Republican onslaught in 1995 with FDR's First Hundred Days in 1933? Both were years of high legislative intensity; both years are likely to be described later as landmarks in 20th-century political history. And, in both years, the discussion of ideas dominated the media.<p>
The differences between the two events are more interesting, and in some cases more subtle. Obviously, the Republicans were critical of Big Government and skeptical of the idea that man can improve his condition through central planning. The Republicans had zeal, but no faith in the perfectibility of man. By contrast, FDR's New Deal promoted the idea that government could solve economic problemsthat individual liberty had to be sacrificed and power centralized in Washington to attack the Great Depression. FDR's spirits were high because he believed man to be capable of pulling the levers and turning the wheels to effectively control America's destiny.<p>
Another difference is often overlooked. The Republican Contract was a conscious, thoughtful, and usually coherent plan that went from campaign document to legislative writ. The New Deal was improvisational and contradictory right from the start. During the 1932 campaign, for example, FDR denounced Hoover for his "reckless spending" and budget deficits. The New Deal to come was never outlined. But in Roosevelt's First Hundred Days, he reversed himself. In just three months, he pushed and signed bills that authorized government to spend almost as much as Hoover did in his entire presidency. FDR wanted a government program for each constituency: AAA for farmers, FERA for the unemployed, TVA for the South, CCC for the young, and so on.<p>
His First Hundred Days were crucial because they shattered the notion that government worked best when it was limited. Government became a Mecca for interest groups that wanted to secure benefits from Washington, so much so that FDR, after his First Hundred Days, could not control the claimants. Cities flooded Congress with requests for road-building money; veterans won cash bonuses for past service; the silver lobby wangled from Washington more subsidy money than even the farmers could manage. American politics had crossed a threshold.<p>
The Republican Contract is a response to the rise of this welfare state and to the twofold protest that the New Deal/Great Society programs mostly haven't worked, and taxes to pay for them are too high. These two points are addressed in part by the Balanced Budget Amendment. If it had included Congressman Dick Armey's flat-tax proposalinstead of seeking to manipulate the current system of tax deductionsthe Contract could have challenged the New Deal more effectively. Special-interest politics, as Roosevelt learned, needs to extract money from some groups in order to support others. A progressive income tax is indispensable to a growing welfare state. In office, FDR soon hiked the top marginal tax rate to 79 percent; later he pushed it to 90 percent. A flat tax, by contrast, forces supporters of new government programs (and old ones, for that matter) to admit they will tax all to benefit a few. That admission alone might lead many to rethink the strong role of government in American society.<p>

Of course it wasn't the same as those Hundred Days. In March 1933, when FDR got Congress to enact a slew of government-aggrandizing lawsthus triggering the New Deal that vastly expanded Washington's control17 million citizens had lost their jobs, 5,000 banks had collapsed, and the nation was mired in the most frightening depression in its history. Amid mass desperation, a Democratic president with a fresh mandate was able to get a Democratic Congress to more or less pass anything he wanted.<p>
The national mood in January 1995, by contrast, was nowhere near as frantic. When Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans uncorked their political revolution, they benefited from none of the panic-driven momentum that the Depression had lent Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats 62 years earlier. Instead, they faced an enemy in the White House, a largely hostile press corps, a $1.6 trillion federal establishment more likely to munch ground glass than relinquish power without a death-struggle, and a Senate led by Bob Dole.So, no, in terms of legislation completed, Gingrich's First Hundred Days don't compare with FDR's. But measured against other yardsticks, the House Republicans' quick-march through the Contract With America was even more significant.<p>
The customary formula of federal politics is: The president proposes, Congress disposes. So thoroughly did Gingrich and his army upend that piece of conventional wisdom that by the end of a hundred days, Bill Clinton was reduced to insisting that he still mattered. "The president," he sniffled in a mid-April press conference, "is relevant here."<p>
The Republicans upended another piece of conventional wisdom: that platformsi.e., ideasdon't win or lose elections. The life cycles of modern party platforms are familiar. Party members meet. They brawl over a couple of planks. They vote for a platform everyone can live with. Then they print a few copies nobody will ever read or care about.<p>
In 1994, GOP House candidates followed a completely different path. They gathered to sign a brief "contract" whose details weren't yet drafted, but whose main promisedrastically reduced federal powerwas crystal-clear. The pundits promptly consigned it to oblivion. Tens of millions of copies appeared in print. And an intense ideological campaign was then waged between the party that wrote the Contract and the party that reviled it.<p>
Never in modern U.S. politics has a party platforma party's statement of principlesmattered more. Two years ago, they lost a White House they had virtually owned because their incumbent didn't grasp the power of "the vision thing"; in November, Republicans conquered a Congress thought to be permanently closed to them precisely because they did.<p>
Or did they?<p>
Right after the GOP won its astonishing victory, Gingrich articulated his Prime Directive: "Cooperate, yes. Compromise, no." Right after that, the compromising began.<p>
The provision for a three-fifths supermajority to approve tax increases was dropped from the Balanced Budget Amendment. The national-security bill was stripped of missile defense. The unfunded-mandates bill repealed precisely zero unfunded federal mandates. The GOP's crime bill wound up with the same price tag as the supposedly "pork-filled" Democratic version of last year. The bloated food-stamp program was exempted from welfare reform. Term limits were croaked.<p>
The Clinton tax increases that Republicans had unanimously opposed in 1993 were left virtually intact. Republicans talked of "zeroing out" government subsidies for the arts and public broadcastinguntil Garth Brooks came by to lobby, and the talk dried up. The House passed a legal-reform bill that federalized great swaths of tort law. Enthusiasm for eliminating entire Cabinet departments was limited to feisty freshmen with no clout and conservative think tanks with no vote. And to mark the completion of the First Hundred Days, Gingrich declared in a television address that his party was certainly not proposing to actually shrink the federal budget.<p>
In its First Hundred Days, the new GOP House majority ignited the conservative revolution it had been elected to achieve. Without question, it has changed the terms of debate on the Hill. But before their sprint through the Contract was done, the Republicans were once again showing the symptoms that had always doomed them in the past: weak knees and thin skin.<p>

<p>
Speaker Gingrich and his lieutenants fulfilled to the letter the Contract with America pledge that ten important issues would be taken to a vote in the House. Observers must be impressed, moreover, by the GOP's passage of nine of these, and by the party's ability to round up four-fifths of its members for the failed term-limits constitutional amendment. The new House leadership has established a remarkable working model of a disciplined, responsible party motivated by deeply-felt principleson one side of Capitol Hill.<p>
And when one looks for long-term significance, there's the rub. As of this writing, the Balanced Budget Amendment has already failed in the Senate, which is widely expected to reject or drastically modify other Contract items. In addition, President Clinton may muster the courage, conviction, or pragmatic judgment to wield a veto or two. What comes out of the Senate and White House legislative sausage-grinders will likely strike Contract devotees as inferior bratwurst rather than fine tenderloin. No, this will not be as significant as FDR's First Hundred Days.<p>
What major mistakes did the Republicans make? Clearly they still need to work on what George Bush might have called "the message thing." Admittedly, it is no easy task to get a conservative perspective past the filter of a predominantly liberal-leaning national media, but it can be done. The leadership was blindsided on the school-lunch issue, although the Democratic tactics were predictable. Thanks to Henry Hyde's impassioned defense of political careerism, network television played the term-limits debate as primarily an argument among Republicans rather than one between Republicans and Democrats. In the absence of a Jack Kemp able to explain in appealing terms the importance of preferences for capital gains and savings, the Democrats appear to have achieved an advantage on the tax-equity issue. Finally, the Speaker, for all his intramural leadership skills, oscillates wildly between flashes of brilliance and egregious gaffes. As a result, he enjoys less public esteem than he deserves.<p>
At the end of the hundred days, the Republicans remain locked in a continuing struggle with the Democrats for the soul of an angry, alienated "populistic" segment of the electoratesimilar to the swing constituency once called "Middle America" and these days attracted to Ross Perot. The GOP can prevail when it convincingly depicts the Democrats as the party of the special interests (affirmative-action beneficiaries, welfare bureaucrats, etc.), but the issue can be used by the Democrats when they depict the Republicans as advocates of tax breaks for "the rich" or abusers of mothers and children. The argument remains unsettled; the Republicans need to do a much better job of articulating their side of it.<p>
Corrosively cynical, this populistic electorate seems to see only business as usual in Washington and is unlikely to give the Republicans much credit for an imperfectly fulfilled Contract. It also still appears prone to believe the budget can be balanced simply by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse while leaving entitlements and pork untouched. It remains uncertain whether this group, or America at large, is prepared for the consequences of a smaller federal establishment: greater local and individual self-reliance.<p>
One last thought: If conservatives want to be successful, they had better stop depicting themselves as involved in a sweeping effort to uproot the New Deal. Speaker Gingrich (perhaps consciously drawing on the example of Ronald Reagan) was right on target in professing admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt and at least some of his accomplishments. The Republicans were elected to reverse the lingering excesses of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, not to take us back to the world of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.<p><I>

There are advantages as well as disadvantages to speed.<p>
The First Hundred Days of the Republican majority were like a laser showfull of color and sound, but so fast and furious that it was difficult for voters to single out the constituent parts.<p>
The Contract gave shape to the first months of Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, which might otherwise have been characterized by fits and starts. Though designed primarily as a vote-getter, the Contract also served extremely well to enforce party discipline. Everyone understood the promise, everyone was committed to the schedule, and factiousness among Republicans was kept to a minimum.<p>
That was the advantage of speed. The disadvantage is that the individual terms of the Contract, many of which deserved a greater hearing, more explanation, and more time before the public, were given short shrift. Few Americans really understand the benefits of tort reform, welfare reform, or regulatory reform.<p>
In a bravura performance over the First Hundred Days, the Republicans made only two errors. The first was the excessive attention to the question of whether or not to punish Senator Mark Hatfield for his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment. In so doing, Republicans themselves (without help from the media) made Hatfield and, accordingly, internecine Republican quarrels, the story of the BBA's failure. In fact, the story ought to have been the six Democrats who switched their votes and defeated a bill they had supported only months before. Hatfield is a liberal Republican. He voted his conscience. Punishment would have been futile. Besides, his breed is dying out. He does not represent the future of the GOP. Effort spent trying to "fix" him would be better directed elsewhere.<p>
The other error was the failure to anticipate the reaction among liberals (especially in the press) to changes in the school-lunch program. Of course the liberals were dishonest, unscrupulous, and brazen in their depiction of the terms of debate ("starving children" indeed!), but it is the job of conservatives in America to prepare for that pitch and knock it out of the park. Ronald Reagan knew that Jimmy Carter was going to portray him as a mad bomber in the 1980 presidential debates, and he was ready with a riposte: "There you go again." But Republicans were caught flat-footed when Democrats accused them of trying to take food from the mouths of babes.<p>
Still, only two mistakes in three months is an enviable record. I wish I could match it.<p><I>

While the fulfillment of the House Republicans' Contract With America in just 92 days is largely worth rejoicing, this momentous occasion also illustrates how Americans have "defined democracy down" through the years. The House's single-minded passage of the Contract's provisions (with the unfortunate and sloppily-handled exception of term limits) was an exhilarating interval in recent political history. Still, the balloons and streamers flew over the U.S. Capitol after the Contract's completion precisely because the House GOP accomplished what Americans should normally expect of their representatives: They engaged them with ideas. They pledged to vote on them, then did so, as promised.<p>
Although this sort of innovation and accountability should be routine, they instead are refreshing departures from the recent national campaigns that have enflamed public cynicism. George Bush's abandoned "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge and Bill Clinton's phantom "middle-class tax cut" illustrate this problem. The Contract's greatest legacy may be that it reversed the rising tide of antagonism that had severely eroded Washington's goodwill with the American public. Now that House Republicans have actually kept their word on the Contract, Congress today enjoys its highest approval rating in years.<p>
Assuming the Senate and President Clinton cooperate, the enactment of most Contract items, per se, will not influence American politics as profoundly as did FDR in his First Hundred Days. However, the paradigm shift that has accompanied the Contract likely will parallel the new thinking that FDR inspired 62 years ago. The Contract and the GOP's takeover of Congress have led Washington to discuss seriously the abolition of the income tax, the closing of at least four Cabinet departments, and a balanced budget by 2002. House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt has now embraced tax simplification, while Bill Clinton has placed federal affirmative-action policies under a microscope. These realities would have been mere hallucinations just nine months ago. By committing themselves to a coherent "vision thing," today's GOP has moved the entire plate of acceptable discourse tectonically to the right.<p>
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies, however, stumbled badly on the so-called "school-lunch" issue. Democrats stereotypically pummel GOP budget cuts and block grants with dusty rhetoric about "starving babies" and "at-risk infants." Republicans should have anticipated these attacks after seeing them haunt Ronald Reagan and George Bush for 12 years. Opening with a salvo against corporate welfaresuch as having Archer-Daniels-Midland tycoon Dwayne Andreas explain to a subcommittee why his multi-billion-dollar agroempire deserves federal subsidieswould have blunted Democratic charges about GOP "greed" and "meanness." So would have energetic reminders that vibrant economic growth especially lifts the poor and unemployed.<p>
The Contract also failed to address the coming entitlements meltdown. While Speaker Gingrich insists it is "off the table," Social Security, as well as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and other give-away programs, jeopardize America's future financial well-being. While a promise to vote on affluence-testing or privatization of these programs would have made the Contract far more controversial, it also would have shown the GOP exhibiting genuine courage. Now, without a mandate to do so, the Republican-led 104th Congress must show even greater bravery by confronting entitlements (try balancing the budget without doing so). Or, it simply can stand back and watch Social Security and Medicare eat us alive. <p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and the new Republican House leadership deserve thanks and congratulations for the successful completion of the Contract With America. What a revolutionary (or more correctly, counterrevolutionary) series of events has taken place! With the Contract, a promise to the American people was made; in a little less than the promised hundred days, the promise was kept. Of what other Congress in this century can that be said?<p>
Certainly some needed changes were made to vexing and intolerable House rules; for the first time, national laws passed by Congress will apply to the House as well as ordinary Americans. Having to live by the rules made for the rest of us cannot but raise the consciousness of the rulemakers and dissuade them from their excesses.<p>
Certainly some important legislation was passed by the House in those historic hundred days. Congress agreed to stop imposing mandates on state and local jurisdictions without paying the bill; such progress was nearly undreamt of in our philosophy just a few months before the Contract was unveiled. Is this important? Indeed it is. Is it enough? Perhaps not. Our liberties have already been eroding for decades; what's worse, the cost of the erosion has been passed down the line. Far better for Congress to forswear dreaming up silly rules to begin with; agreeing to pay their cost only solves half the problem. But let us not quibble with progress in the right direction. The looming struggle to actually cut federal spending by billions of dollars may preclude any more erosions.<p>
Congratulations are also deserved for passing a tax cut and for stepping forth on welfare reform. Has the American public forgotten the promises made by then-Governor Bill Clinton when he campaigned for president? A middle-class tax cut? The end of welfare as we know it? The new House leadership promised both, and they, not Clinton, kept the promise.<p>
But a word of caution on the welfare-reform proposals: Just as limited congratulations are due for eliminating unfunded mandates, limited caution is due for proposing to send money to the states in the form of block grants with no strings attached. This will create, as someone has noted, "funded unmandates."<p>
For those of us in California, this is an interesting exercise in neofederalisma tasty bit of proper philosophy, or revolutionary devolution, if you will. The warning is this: The California legislature, perhaps more than any other state legislature, has suffered from Congress-envy for at least the last three decades. If California legislators suddenly find billions of dollars dropped in their allegedly bare general-fund cupboard, what mischief might they do? Conservatives and libertarians alike want major programs such as welfare brought closer to us, closer to our scrutiny, closer to our effective control. Will we get what we want, or will we get a more fearsome monster than the current federal system? In this case, sense may have been sacrificed for speed; again, the federal government would do far better to reduce taxes, forswearing the revenue, than collecting and then returning the money in skewed proportions.<p>
All in all, hearty congratulations to the House Republican leadership! Promises made, promises keptwho could ask for more? At least, who could ask for more in the First Hundred Days? May the next five hundred days go as well! Legislators keeping promisesit might catch on.<p><I>

The Contract With America committed the House Republicans to raising and voting on each of the Contract items. This was accomplished and should be considered a major shift from politics as usual.<p>
One major frustration that Americans have expressed in recent years is that they vote for change but get only lip service from political leaders. The significance in the Contract With America is that a group of politicians did what they said they would. The Contract raises the level of political debate to one of performance and effectiveness, rather than distortion, political expediency, and misrepresentation by political officials, candidates, and parties.<p>
The greatness of these hundred days is that they changed the political process. The substantive change is yet to be determined. It is still too early to tell whether the policies passed by the House in the First Hundred Days will become law, and if so, what effect they will ultimately have on American life and culture.<p>
Even now, however, we can see a shifting of attitude among the American people. Inherent in the policy and legislative changes proposed in the Republicans' First Hundred Days are the notions of individual responsibility and accountability for one's actions. Government appears to be seen as a catalyst and facilitator for change, but not the ultimate determinant of the individual lives of our citizens.<p>
Major mistakes during the First Hundred Days include the failure to support term limits as forcefully as other elements of the Contract. The leadership vacillated and approached this issue tentatively. They should have committed firmly to this issue, which was approved in all of the 22 states where it was considered by the voters.<p>
The leadership allowed the debate to deteriorate into "them vs. us" on issues such as the school-lunch program and the group-home concept for unwed teenage mothers without stable homes of their own. The leadership allowed these ideas and "those conservative Republicans" supporting them to be portrayed as insensitive or callous. They should instead have placed the true nature of these issues at the center of the debate.<p><I>

Buried deep within one of the many articles that sought to account for the tragic suicide of Kurt Cobain last year was a most surprising revelation. According to Village Voice writer Sarah Ferguson, the grunge-rock pioneer's favorite television shows included Leave It to Beaver and Mayberry, R.F.D.<p>
That a cutting-edge cultural icon married to alternative rock's premier feminist (Courtney Love, of the band Hole) could have such retrograde, politically incorrect viewing tastes was, in Ferguson's mind, "odd." But it was also revealing. Grunge rock "is music for kids who grew up too fast," Ferguson says. "It engages in a kind of mournful nostalgia for a childhood without violation." <p>
Cobain was certainly no stranger to violation. Every significant examination of his life regards the divorce of his parents as a major turning point. In fact, so painful were Cobain's memories of the divorce that he once held a gun to his head and told his wife, "I'd rather die than divorce."<p>
Clearly, one does not have to regard Mayberry as nirvana in order to believe that Cobain and many members of his generation would have fared far better if they had grown up in something resembling Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. Yet, few people todayeven conservativesare prepared to confront the problem that first sent Cobain's young life reeling. Indeed, when Dan Quayle returned last year to the San Francisco club where he gave his famous 1992 Murphy Brown speech, he was quick to point out that when he spoke of the problems surrounding single-parent families, he wasn't referring to "households where the father has died, or even where he is separated by divorce." Rather, Quayle said, he was referring to "those households that have never known a father."<p>
Now, in fairness to Quayle, he also noted that "the ideal situation for our children is to be born and raised in an intact family." Nevertheless, by suggesting that divorce has more in common with death (which is almost always involuntary) than with illegitimacy (almost always voluntary), Quayle's remarks contribute to the trivialization of divorce at a time when social scientists are increasingly likely to agree that the impact of divorce on children is almost always negative and often devastating.<p>
Indeed, as Barbara Dafoe Whitehead argued in her celebrated article on family break-up in the Atlantic Monthly, divorcelike illegitimacyis strongly linked to a wide variety of negative outcomes for children, from child abuse and neglect to serious juvenile crime. A 1994 study of juveniles in the Wisconsin correction system found that 1 in 3 came from divorced or separated homes. Several studies show that unmarried girls whose parents divorce are much more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant out of wedlock than girls from intact households. A 1994 study by researchers at Duke and North Carolina State University reported that family dissolution is a stronger predictor of suicide for young males than such factors as unemployment.<p>
Despite the clear impact of family break-up on children, "some people aren't comfortable talking about divorce and adultery," former Education Secretary William Bennett told a Christian Coalition conference last year. "But it seems to me we have to talk about them. They are before us, and they have great consequences."<p>
Great indeed. The number of children directly affected by divorce has more than doubled in a generation, from 463,000 in 1960 to 985,000 in 1991. Until political and cultural leaders give proper attention to the link between divorce and many of our nation's most serious social problemscrime, poverty, educational declinewe stand little chance of reversing these trends. <p> <b><center>Too Close to Home</b></center>
<p>
One of the obvious reasons there is less public handwringing about divorce than illegitimacy is because divorce hits closer to home in middle America. As Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute recently observed, "Whereas illegitimacy happens mostly among people who live on the other side of the tracks, much divorce and separation takes place in 'our' own neighborhoods, indeed among our friends and relations, and sometimes even ourselves." Divorce is subject to the phenomenon Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan calls "defining deviancy down," in which a society loses its capacity to define certain problems as problems because of their sheer prevalence. Illegitimacy, conversely, continues to be viewed as "deviant" because it is still fairly rare among the middle and upper classes.<p>
It is frequently asserted that half of all marriages end in divorce. The number, derived by comparing the annual number of marriages to the annual number of divorces, overstates the likelihood of a failed first marriage.  This is because the number is skewed upward by the experience of men and women who have gone through divorce many times. The truth is that about one quarter of all adults who have ever been married in America today have also experienced divorce.<p>
Still, divorce is common enough that to raise concerns about it publicly is to risk being impolitic. As Bennett puts it, "The rules are broken down. If you leave your wife and get yourself a 'trophy wife,' you're not going to be greeted with condemnation or even a raised eye by most people, because it has become a convention."<p>
Not only has this convention stifled debate, but it has helped create an expectation of marital failure that can be seen throughout our culture. A recent cartoon in a major publication depicted one young adult saying to another, "It's only marriage I'm proposing after all, not a lifetime commitment." Similarly, in a recent Newsweek story on divorce, one young woman explained why she limited the guest list at her wedding to 70 people, less than one third the size of her sister's wedding list: "I was afraid to make that much of an investment," she said. "What if it didn't work out? Then, I'd have to tell all those people." <p>
Such apprehensions about marriage are especially common among those whose parents have split up. A study by Pamela Webster, a sociologist at Brown University, found that adults whose parents had divorced rated their own chances of divorcing to be considerably higher than did adults whose parents had not divorced. This finding held up even when comparing groups of couples who rated their marital happiness equally. <p>
Sadly, expectations of marital failure have a way of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologist Silvio Silvestri reports that adult children of divorced parents are four times more likely to get divorced than adult children of intact couples. <p><b><center>The Myth of the Good Divorce</center></b> <p>
Another hindrance to public discussion of marital dissolution  is that many Americans still want to believe that divorce can lead to greater personal fulfillment and stronger relationships between men and women. In the closing scene of the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire, the central character offers some grandmotherly advice to a young girl trying to come to terms with her parents' break-up. "Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together," Mrs. Doubtfire says. "They don't fight all the time and they can become better people and much better mommies and daddies." <p>
However much many would like to believe this view of divorce, it is increasingly at odds with the experiences of both children and adults. A study at the University of Oregon found that the impact of divorce on a woman's health and well-being is far more serious than the impact of being fired. Another study, from the University of Alberta, shows that divorced or separated individuals are roughly three times as likely to commit suicide as married people. The University of Texas reports that "divorced men exhibit substantially higher rates of psychological distress and alcohol consumption than do married men." And David Larson of the National Institute for Healthcare Research reports that "being divorced and a non-smoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying married."<p>
These and other research findings recently prompted an eclectic group of prominent scholars known as the Council on Families to issue a report decrying the state of marriage in America. The report observed, "In the domain of marriage and family life, our recent explosions of freedom have taken a terrible and largely unexpected toll. Relationships between men and women are not improving; they are becoming more difficult and more unhappy. Many women are experiencing chronic economic insecurity. Many men are isolated and estranged from their children. Many more people are lonely."<p><b><center>Rebuilding the Walls</b></center>
<p>
Over the last three decades, the walls surrounding lifelong marriage have crumbled. The age-old social barriers to divorce, promiscuity, illegitimacy, and cohabitation have been removed in the name of promoting personal freedom and self-expression. A growing number of peopleespecially those in Cobain's generationnow know first-hand that the walls that were thought to entrap and restrict were really there to protect.<p>
So how can the walls be rebuilt? How can confidence in the institution of marriage be restored? Although it would be a mistake to draw inspiration from the last three decades of welfare-state activism, there are some constructive models for addressing certain social problems. One such model is the anti-smoking movement.<p>
At a time when virtually every other area of American life was becoming more and more permissive, the anti-smoking movement succeeded in convincing the American public to adopt less permissive attitudes about smoking. Not only did many Americans change their own behavior (the proportion of adult smokers fell from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 25.6 percent in 1991), but Americans supported efforts to modify the behavior of others. <p>
The anti-smokers' success was due to many factors, including:<ul>
<li>
The careful collection and dissemination of compelling research on the health risks of smoking and inhaling second-hand smoke;<li>
The effective use of media persuasion, including articles, op-eds, essays, reports, and public-service advertisements;<li>
The tireless pursuit of incremental changes in public policy (limiting sales to minors, banning smoking on airplanes and in public buildings, etc.); <li>
The periodic sponsorship of special events (like the Great American Smoke-Out) to raise public awareness and spur private action;<li>
The ongoing provision of practical services (counseling, support groups, etc.) to people interested in behavioral change.</ul>
<p>
To restore confidence in marriage, we need a similar multidimensional strategy. This strategy should seek to repeat the anti-smokers' success, giving particular emphasis to the following four ideas:<p>
Focus on the future. For many people, the subject of divorce is intensely personal and extremely painful. It evokes bad memories and bitter feelings. As such, no attempt to restore public confidence in the institution of marriage is likely to succeed unless it is forward-looking. <p>
This means focusing public attention on lowering the divorce rate henceforth. And it means giving greater emphasis to the future choices of today's young people than to the choices made by their parents. "It may be unreasonable to expect a widespread change of heart about marriage among today's adults," states the Council on Families. "But young people can and often do strive to rebel, to be idealistic, and to do things differently than their elders."<p>
Indeed, in one marriage-related areasexualitythere is already evidence of a movement among today's young people to challenge norms ushered in by their parents' generation. In the last few years, hundreds of thousands of young people have joined public campaigns pledging to save sex for marriage, and the proportion of high schoolers who report that they have had sexual intercourse at least once has declined by at least 6 percentage points since 1990.<p>
A youth-oriented campaign extolling the virtues of lifelong marriage is likely to win support from intact married couples. And it should win support as well from many who have experienced divorce, since most divorced parents want marital success for their children every bit as much as intact couples do. 	<p>
Still, success will not come easily. While many children of divorce long for the strong, enduring marriages their parents never had, many are wary of commitment and fear repeating their parents' mistakes. This is one reason cohabitation is so prevalent among the young. Yet, far from increasing the likelihood of marital success, "trial marriages" actually are linked to higher divorce rates. Indeed, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family found that 40 percent of cohabiting unions disintegrate before marriage, and that marital unions that begin as a cohabiting relationship have a 50 percent higher rate of divorce than those that do not. <p>
Challenge the church. No cultural institution is more important to the restoration of marriage than the religious community. Churches and synagogues claim a time-honored, divinely-ordained role to help couples understand the moral and spiritual nature of their marriage vows. Religious institutions bear a unique responsibility for helping those embarking on and struggling to maintain marriage commitments. Similarly, only faith communities can offer redemptive hope to people who have experienced marital failure.<p>
While religious leaders do not bear full responsibility for the absence of public discourse about divorce, they can hardly blame others for the failure of many marriages. Author Michael McManus notes that many churches have become "blessing machines" that wed interested couples but offer few marriage-related services, like counseling for engaged and married couples, practical advice on how to strengthen troubled marriages, and mentoring programs for younger couples.<p>
Sermons that warn against divorce or condemn the casual termination of marriages are not popular among some ministers, McManus says. Sermons that acknowledge that the Bible prohibits remarriage in some cases (Matthew 5:32) are even less popular, even though unqualified acceptance of divorce and remarriage can only discourage marital perseverance.<p>
The failure of the church (particularly the Protestant church) to significantly influence the surrounding culture can be seen in the fact that four of the six states with the worst divorce rates in the country (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) are found right in the heart of the Bible Belt.<p>
When religious leaders take seriously their responsibility for strengthening marriage in their congregations and their communities, divorce does decline. For example, several years ago, ministers in Peoria, Illinois, adopted a community marriage policy that stated none of the city's churches would marry any couple that had not completed a premarital counseling program. In the three-year period after the pact was adopted, Peoria's divorce rate fell nearly 20 percent.<p>
Elevate marriage in public policy. America's retreat from marriage is first and foremost a problem of the heart. It cannot be fixed by the issuance of a government decree or by the adoption of a new government policy. <p>
This does not mean, however, that reform of public policy has no place in a larger strategy to restore confidence in marriage. The law is a teacher. America's casual attitudes about marital permanence are both reflected in and advanced by laws that permit "no-fault" divorce in cases where one spouse wishes to preserve the union, and by laws that require some married couples to pay dramatically higher taxes than cohabiting couples.<p>
Reversing these misguided policies will not only help those directly affected by them, but will also teach others that lifelong marriage is the normative standard our society upholds. Thus, pro-marriage policy reform is both an end in itself, in that it corrects legal wrongs, and a means to an end, in that it stimulates a broader cultural appreciation of marital permanence.<p>
How, then, do we solve these problems? Michigan's state legislature is considering a divorce-reform proposal that would require the establishment of "fault" in cases where one spouse wants to preserve the marriage. This change (and a similar provision requiring "fault" in cases where children are involved) would make family abandonment more difficult by offering greater legal protection to innocent parties in divorce cases.<p>
In the tax front, three ideas deserve attention. Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute advocates the resurrection of "income-splitting," a practice that allows married couples to divide their total earnings evenly between them before assessing their tax liability. This practice prevents a second income from kicking couples into a higher tax bracketwhether that second income comes from a wage-earning wife or a moonlighting husband. <p>
Another tax option worth considering is a deduction that would adjust tax liability not just for marital status, but also for marital longevity. Tax benefits that modestly increase with each year that a couple stays together would allow a portion of the societal benefit associated with marital stability to be claimed by those who have been married the longest.<p>
Certainly, one must guard against wildly skewing the tax code to promote social goals. But if divorce truly imposes economic costs on society (higher crime, greater need for remedial education, higher health-care costs, and the like), then it may be beneficial to allow lifelong married partners to pay slightly lower taxes than their contemporaries who are married for the second or third time.<p>
Finally, we should consider eliminating "means-testing" in various government programs, since income-based limits on program eligibility tend to penalize marriage. Some married households with income above the threshold can qualify for benefits if they split up and form two separate households. Likewise, some cohabiting couples able to claim benefits as unmarried individuals would lose their benefits if they were to marry and combine their household income.<p>
Valorize marital toughness. There is a common misconception that couples who have good, solid, enduring marriages are "lucky." Supposedly, happily married couples do not face any of the conflicts and struggles that other couples face. They do not go through rough times or encounter serious relational turbulence.<p>
The truth is, every marriage faces trials and hardships and breakdowns in communication. Yes, some couples manage to limit conflict better than others, but every marriage faces difficulties. Ruth Bell Graham was once asked if she had ever contemplated divorcing her husband, evangelist Billy Graham. "No," she said, "but I have considered murder."<p>
If every marriage faces challenges, why is it that some survive and others do not? According to John Gottman, of the University of Washington at Seattle, couples that succeed work hard at resolving conflict. In his recent book, Why Marriages Succeed or Fail, Gottman argues that many of the theories about why some couples divorcemoney problems, sexual disagreements, incompatibility, and so onfail to explain why other equally dissatisfied couples confronting these very same issues do not split up. The real issue, Gottman concludes, is not money or sex or compatibility. The real issue, instead, is whether couples are willing and able to work out their marital differences.<p>
Research by social scientists Nick Stinnett and John DeFrain shows that one of the seven characteristics commonly found in strong, healthy families is the ability to deal effectively with conflict and crisis. Like Gottman, Stinnett and DeFrain find that couples who have to work through difficult problems believe that experience strengthens their marriages. This is important, because most public discussion about divorce revolves around whether divorce would be better than a marriage in which spouses are fighting all the time. This framework assumes falsely that a marriage gone sour can never be made sweet again. It encourages many couples to throw in the towel prematurely. <p>
David Blankenhorn, the president of the Institute for American Values, argues that a broad spectrum of marriages exists in America today. At one end are a small percentage of marriages that are almost effortlessly blissful; at the other, a small percentage that are headed for almost certain failure. Between these two extremes, Blankenhorn says, are the overwhelming majority of marriages: unions that can, with grit and perseverance, not only endure but prosper. <p>
Encouraging lasting commitment in a society that seeks instant gratification is no small challenge. But if it is true that people tend to do those things that are most apt to earn them a good reputation, then it follows that deliberate efforts to valorize marital toughness and perseverance are needed in everything from high-school textbooks to Hollywood movie scripts. At the very least, such efforts could help counterbalance existing cultural messages that undercut marital permanence and stability.<p>
Efforts to valorize enduring commitment should be particularly targeted at men, who historically have shown a greater propensity to neglect family responsibilities than have women. Turning the hearts of men to their families may do more to address divorce (and many other social problems) than any other proposed remedy. On this front, the most encouraging signs on the cultural landscape are the emergence of groups urging men to see that self-sacrifice is a defining characteristic of authentic masculinity. The National Fatherhood Initiative is devising strategies to restore the importance of fathers in society's thinking about family and community life. The National Center for Fathering helps provide dads with practical childrearing skills. The Promise Keepers movement challenges men to make and keep a set of pledges to their wives and families. This year, more than 600,000 men are expected to attend Promise Keepers conferences and seminars.<p>
Given the tenuous state of marriage in Americaand the tragic consequences of divorce on kids like Kurt Cobainone should hope that these efforts succeed. America desperately needs more men to commit themselves to their wives in the way that Theodore Roosevelt once did. On the day that his wife accepted his marriage proposal, Roosevelt wrote in his journal: "The aim of my whole life shall be to make her happy and to shield her and guard her from trial, and, oh, how I shall cherish my sweet queen. How she, so pure and sweet and beautiful can think of marrying me, I cannot understand, but I praise and thank God it is so."

It was a horrible tragedy, as much for the mental images it generated as for the death toll. On September 3, 1991, at around 8 a.m., a fire broke out at a chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina.  As the grease fire started on a chicken fryer and spread quickly inside the Imperial Foods Products building, workers tried desperately to escape the smoke and flames, clawing at locked exit doors in panic. Twenty-five Imperial employees didn't make it. Fifty-six more were injured in the blaze. The event made national headlines and attracted everyone from network news reporters to Jesse Jackson, who visited in an attempt to link the chicken-plant tragedy to the national civil-rights movement. "I see the same faces here that I saw in Memphis, Tennessee, with Dr. [Martin Luther] King," he said. "Just basic, humble people who want to work and get a fair day's wages for a fair day's work."<p>
Furious voices denounced state and federal safety inspectors, as well as the state's business community. During 1992 and 1993, the Hamlet fire became the cause clbre of politicians and activists seeking tougher workplace-safety laws in Congress, including a greatly expanded Occupational Safety and Health Administration and new mandates on businesses. As Hamlet became a national symbol for corporate irresponsibility in workplace safety, one small but significant detail escaped the notice of many in Congress and the media. Those exit doors that sealed the deathtrap had been ordered closed and locked by the federal government.<p>
The problem with the Imperial plant, a U.S. Department of Agriculture poultry inspector had said the previous June, was flies. "Both doors at the [trash] compactor was [sic] open when I arrived at 8:45 p.m.," the inspector wrote in a deficiency report. "Several flies [were] observed in all areas of the plant." Imperial's response, also written into the deficiency report, was to promise that the outside doors "will be kept locked." The inspector verified that corrective action had taken place.<p>
Imperial Foods was hardly blameless in the tragedyvarious safety problems existed at the time of the firebut heavy-handed government regulation was also partly responsible. The chicken plant was one of the few employers in a poor, rural community. It ran on a very thin margin, using an old building and struggling every week to keep production going. Installing state-of-the-art alarm doors at the side and rear of the plant was an expensive proposition. When forced by federal edict to make a tradeoff between food quality and worker safety, plant managers chose the former, with disastrous results.<p>
Fast forward to 1995. A new Republican majority in Congress, intent on balancing the federal budget, has targeted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for cuts. In an attempt to defend OSHA, the Clinton administration announced a plan in May to make compliance less onerous to business and to judge safety inspectors on the basis of safety records for companies they oversee, not on the number of citations they write. "This is the new face of OSHA," said Elaine Kamarck, senior policy advisor for Vice President Gore and director of his "reinventing government" initiative.<p>
But a Congress committed not only to budget savings but also to sound policymaking should go far beyond redesigning OSHA's inspection program or, as some GOP lawmakers have suggested, simply cutting its budget in half. There is no need for the federal government to inspect American workplaces, issue regulations, and fine employers for violating federal safety rules, and the attempt to do so has accomplished virtually nothing for American workers except burden their employers with regulations.<p>
A 1991 study by Wayne B. Gray of the National Bureau of Economic Research found that OSHA regulations have "significantly reduced productivity growth in the U.S.," even more than those from the Environmental Protection Agency. Some OSHA standards have put a search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Benzene standards, for example, have cost firms and consumers $23 million per life saved; arsenic standards, $24 million. Standards for asbestos, EDB, and formaldehyde have also cost many millions of dollars per life saved. These huge sums might better be spent publicly or privately on other measures that save lives at dramatically lower costs. Screening programs for cervical and colon cancer, for example, cost about $50,000 per life saved, while measures to increase highway safetysuch as improving lighting, upgrading guard rails, installing median barriers, and improving bridgescost between $100,000 and $200,000 per life saved.<p>
OSHA has required employers to label machines and substances at the workplace with little regard for reason or significant risk. Dr. Michael Segal, of Harvard Medical School, reports that OSHA regulators have ordered suppliers of many of his laboratories' chemicals to label them as workplace hazards, including sodium chloride (table salt): "WARNING: CAUSES IRRITATION. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Avoid breathing dust. Wash thoroughly after handling." Similarly, another chemical's label provides a "Waste Disposal Method: Dissolve or mix the material with a combustible solvent and burn in a chemical incinerator equipped with an afterburner and scrubber. Observe all federal, state, and local environmental regulations." The hazardous material in question, Dr. Segal says, is candle wax.<p>
This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 2,000 inspectors across the country. As large as this effort is, its main task is even larger: to inspect 6 million workplaces with 93 million employees. On average, a company can expect to see an OSHA inspector once every 10 years. Even doubling or tripling the number of inspectors, in other words, wouldn't accomplish very much if the means of ensuring worker safety is to be workplace inspection. No doubt when OSHA was created in 1970, with the strong backing of labor unions, the impossibility of its task wasn't yet evident.<p>
In a smaller, performance-oriented, "reengineered"  federal government, OSHA would survive only as an advisory agency, or perhaps wouldn't survive at all. Its role in promoting worker safety has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector incentives. Companies make bad decisions on occasion, of course, sometimes endangering the safety of their workers. But as the Hamlet case shows, so do regulators. The difference is that companies pay an economic price for their mistakes.<p><center><b>The Workplace Safety Record</b></center><p>
The Hamlet fire, and a few other workplace disasters, are tragic and make good copy or news footage, but they tell us virtually nothing about worker safety in the United States. And the reality is that worker safety has been improving for decades. Companies have undertaken massive campaigns of training, coordination, technological investment, and management innovation to realize tremendous safety gains. Businesses have huge incentives to promote safety, such as lost productivity and workers' compensation or liability insurance costs, that swamp the prospect of regulatory violations. They have found that safe workers are happy workers, and happy workers are productive ones.<p>
Northern Indiana Public Service Company's Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station is far more typical of corporate America's record on safety than Imperial Foods. Each year, all employees must attend two safety-education classes. In addition, the plant holds weekly "safety tailgate sessions" with all its workers to discuss specific safety topics. Accidents and "near-misses" prompt an intensive incident review, whose results are discussed at weekly safety sessions. Workers and managers alike think of safety not as a program but as a process. The plant's motto typifies everyone's commitment: "Safety, Pride, Teamwork." "We were able to make significant strides by having our employees buy into our cause," says J.N. Kocsis, personnel and safety supervisor at the Mitchell station. In just 10 years, from 1982 to 1992, the rate of accidents at the plant fell by 57 percent.<p>
Nationally, the number of people injured annually, at work and home combined, fell by 15 percent from 1970 to 1990, with most of the decrease occurring during the 1980s. Accidental deaths show an even steeper decline; both the rate and the actual number of deaths have been falling for more than 60 years. The number of workplace accidental deaths fell from about 20,000 in the 1930s to less than 10,000 in 1993. Factoring in population growth, the National Safety Council reports that accidental-death rates at work fell from 15.8 to 3.5 per 100,000 peoplea 78 percent drop. Measures of specific hazards also show a steady downward trend. In just the 10 years from 1983 to 1992, the number of firefighters and civilians killed by smoke and flames fell by 34 percent and 20 percent respectively. <p>
Accidental-death rates may well be a better overall guide of safety trends than reports of all injuries and illnesses. There is good reason to believe that the latter may understate safety gains because companies, workers, and individuals have become more likely to report accidents and injuries over time. <p>
These safety gains can't be attributed to regulatory efforts on the part of federal, state, and local governments. Accidental deaths at work adjusted by population, declined at roughly the same rate before and after the passage of the 1970 Occupational Health and Safety Act.<p>
One way to think about the relative efforts of government and business in the safety arena is this: On any given day in America, thousands of local, state, and national safety regulators are inspecting businesses, studying test data, issuing regulations, and adjudicating violations. <p>
But on that same day, millions of American workers, managers, designers, and engineers are working to make their workplaces safer, to maximize sales and revenues, minimize losses, and maintain good, long-term relationships with productive employees. The magnitude of private-sector safety efforts, both in time and money spent, far exceeds that of even today's bloated regulatory bureaucracy.<p>
Safety gains have occurred across the economy, from highway fatalities to child poisonings, but it is at the workplace, over which businesses have greater direct control, where safety gains have been the largest. While accidents still happen and some jobs remain more dangerous than others, there have been very few years in the past six decades in which workplace accidental deaths have risen rather than fallen. To understand why firms might spend a great deal of time and money improving worker safety, you must first get a clear picture of how costly it is to have a serious accident in a workplace.<p>
There are two main private-sector "regulators" of occupational safety. The first is the labor market itself. In the market for workers, perceptions of risk have a significant impact on the wages employees demand. If a profession or individual business is known to be unsafe, potential workers will want more salary or benefits to compensate for the higher risk. Even if workers don't know going in how dangerous a particular workplace is, their subsequent discovery can cost firms a bundle. For example, when a business loses a proficient worker in an accident, even for a relatively short time, that worker must be replaced with a new one, often needing training. The injured employees' coworkers also reappraise their own job risks, sometimes resulting in higher wage demands. The firm's hiring and training costs rise again if disaffected workers quit. The resulting turmoil can wreak havoc on production, costing the firm sales.<p>
The safety risks posed by businesses differ dramatically, but studies have estimated that the labor market adds an average risk premium of about $1,000 to each worker's salarymeaning that, on average, workers demand $1,000 more in salary than they otherwise would to compensate them for the workplace risks they perceive. Finding ways to reduce that cost is clearly a desirable goal for any business, large or smalland keep in mind that this $1,000 is only the mean. Some firms face very high risk premiums and save a lot of money from even modest safety improvements. Occupations such as logging, meat-packing, mining, and construction continue to pose a higher-than-average risk of injury. For these occupations, says Duke University economist Kip Viscusi, "the marketplace generates enormous wage premiums for risk on the order of $80 billion a year in terms of higher wagesthat's where firms get their financial incentive for safety."<p>
In the search for safety gains, employers have a strong ally: the insurance industry. By law, most employers must have workers' compensation insurance for their employees, but can purchase their coverage from the private insurer of their choice. The workers' comp system is at least partially "experience rated"; that is, the premiums bear some relationship to a business's rate of accidents. Firms that find ways to cut their accident rates pay lower insurance premiums. Insurers who help their subscribers cut accident rates and costs are more likely to keep their customers in the future. So both business managers and insurance underwriters have huge financial incentives to improve workplace safety (although unwise state regulation still keeps the system less efficient and safety-promoting than it could be). "If you're a good company with a good safety record, insurance companies are knocking on your door for your business," says Steve Reynolds, safety supervisor at Crowder Construction Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. Many workers' comp insurers employ armies of consultants, engineers, and designers to help their subscribers reduce accident rates and cut the costs of claims.<p>
The cost of mandated workers' compensation coverage on American business skyrocketed during the latter half of the 1980s, not so much because of an actual increase in danger at the workplace, but because of federal court decisions liberalizing eligibility requirements. Workers found it easier to file claims, while state governments made mandatory benefit levels more generous. The result was a surge in workers' claims, pushing the total bill for workers' compensation insurance to $70 billion a year. While this development had many negative consequences for economic growth, particularly for states with higher benefit levels, it also meant that the insurance market became more competitive than ever, as American companies sought ways to cut down of one of their most explosive labor costs.<p>
Compared with the risk premium imposed on firms by the labor market and workers' comp premiums imposed by insurers, the prospect of being fined by OSHA is almost laughably tiny in dollar value. Average OSHA fines per U.S. worker were about 50 cents in the early 1990sup from 35 cents in 1983 but below the peak of 65 cents in 1978, according to Duke's Viscusi. Considering that the likelihood of being inspected, much less found in violation, is low in a given year, these fines obviously play little to no role in business decisions about safety. Increasing OSHA inspection or increasing fines aren't likely to change that underlying economic calculation very much. <p>	<b><center>Gains Through Innovation</b></center>
<p>
Innovative and responsible companies and insurers have spent years learning how to reduce safety-related costs by reengineering workplaces, training employees, and using new technologies. Even small changes can reap big rewards. Take Rosendin Electric, Inc., a San Jose, California-based electrical contractor. Linda Johnson, Rosendin's benefits administrator, says that when she first came to the company in 1991, it wasn't tracking workers' compensation costs in an efficient manner. Rates of accident frequency and severity were soaring to worrisome levels.<p>
Teaming up with the firm's safety director and risk manager, Johnson employed a new computer software package to track the type and total number of injuries, as well as dollars being spent in premiums. She found that approximately 50 percent of total claim costs were for back- and eye-related injuries. Back injuries alone were costing the company an average of $15,000 to $20,000 for each instance. "Many of the injuries could have been prevented if they'd been tracked effectively," Johnson says.<p>
Supplied with up-to-date reports on how and where accidents were happening, Rosendin managers were able to find their biggest risks and address them. The company started a program to train workers about the importance of back-support belts (providing them to the workers for free) and how to work with the least amount of stress on the back. Rosendin managers also found that a major cause of eye injuries was that workers weren't wearing their safety glasses when they needed to. Much of the company's work was done on high ladders, but safety glasses were needed only some of the time. Workers ended up leaving the glasses at the bottom of the ladder rather than balance them precariously at the top, but then didn't bother to climb all the way down to retrieve the glasses when their use was warranted. "Employees needed something to keep their glasses around their necks when they weren't wearing them," Johnson explains. A simple solution followed: Each pair of glasses was equipped with a cord to go around a worker's neck. That one seemingly minor action reduced eye injuries by 20 percent. Between October 1992 and October 1993, Rosendin workers' comp claims decreased in frequency by 35 percent. The severity rate fell by 10 percent, and the company saved 27 percent in claims.<p>
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive found another simple way to achieve safety gains at its Lafayette, Indiana, plant. Twice a day for five minutes, all employees are encouraged to participate in group exercise workouts. Twisting to workout standards like the theme from Rocky, employees stretch their arms, legs, necks, and backs before beginning work assembling cars, moving materials, or even typing on computers. New employees also learn about exercise and physical exertion during their two-week orientations. Of 80 hours of orientation, 45 hours are devoted to physical training. Employees participate in various exercises depending upon their upcoming responsibilities in the plant. In-house physical therapists coordinate these programs, and more than pay for themselves in reduced workers' compensation costs, say Subaru-Isuzu officials. "Our goal is to prevent injuries," says Mark Siwiec, manager of safety and environmental compliance. "If injuries do occur, however, they should be less severe."<p>
Other companies have found similar results from modest changes in operation or training. When too many AT&T workers were getting injured working on telephone poles, the company started a "pole-climbing school" to teach the three-point contact methodmeaning that workers should keep three limbs touching the pole at all times. Once AT&T workers mastered the method, accident rates fell. Similarly, Coca-Cola Bottling Group cut accident rates among its truck operators by instituting warm-up exercises, improving interior lighting in company trailers, adding more trailer hand grips, and lowering the trailers two inches to make it easier for workers to pull out the cases of drinks.<p>
LSG/Sky Chefs, an in-flight caterer based in Arlington, Texas, has realized significant safety gains by experimenting with financial incentives. In the late 1980s, the firm was logging 1,000 injuries a year and losing more than 18,000 workdaysthis at a company with 8,000 employees. Sky Chefs kitchen workers were constantly straining their backs lifting heavy objects, an injury that costs $25,000 in workers' comp claims on average. <p>
New president Michael Kay introduced a safety program in 1991 to address the problem. Employees were taught how to lift objects without back strain. Kitchen workers got a weekly five-minute "safety short" taught by one of their coworkers. And the firm began offering financial rewards to workers with good safety habits. Supervisors passed out $20 Sears gift certificates to employees who lifted or cut in an exemplary way or who took the initiative to clean up a spill. Supervisors, in turn, saw their own compensation change to make safety a priority. A quarter of their bonus was tied to their unit's safety record. These and other changes helped reduce lost workdays at Sky Chefs to 8,500 in 1993 and about 5,000 in 1994. Focusing on rewards rather than punishments was the key to the new program's success, says Kay. "Our old approach was called the Stop program. It was designed to catch employees doing something wrong. This one's had a remarkably better effect."<p>	<b><center>Insurers Play Role</b></center>
<p>
Some of the most sizable gains in workplace safety have take place in recent years under the tutelage of insurance companies. Insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, for example, helped one of its clients, a book publisher, set up a worker safety program that included routine monitoring, goal setting, active involvement by management, strategic planning, and bonuses tied to safety performance. The publisher had seen its accident rate rise and its workers' comp costs shoot up by 41 percent from 1987 to 1990. After Johnson & Higgins helped the company install its new safety program, workers' comp claims dropped by 35 percent and dollar losses by 63 percent the first year. Georgia-Pacific Corp., the forest-products company, worked with insurers in Georgia to reduce accidents by 31 percent in 1991 and 1992, with Georgia-Pacific's sawmills experiencing only one half of the industry's average number of incidents.<p>
Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company in Connecticut has made a $562 million business out of reducing workplace accidents. The firm is now the leading provider of boiler and machinery insurance in the United States. "Our interests and our customers' interests are aligned," says Wilson Wilde, president of Hartford Steam Boiler. "Both of us are going to be hurt financially if an accident occurs, so we can justify investing time and money in loss prevention." Most of the company's 4,000 employees are  scientists, engineers, and technicians, who work with electric utilities, chemical plants, and paper manufacturers. They have developed an array of devices, processes, and designs to enhance safety, including a device introduced in 1990 to examine hard-to-reach boiler tubes for corrosion. The company has worked with utilities to detect problems with steam-turbine rotors to head off high replacement costs. It used new sensor technology to diagnose a turbine's vibrations and signal when to weld cracks shut. Fixing rather than replacing rotors saved millions for the insurer's utility subscribers while reducing the danger of faulty rotors coming apart in generators.<p>
Reengineering workplaces using principles of ergonomics has become a common strategy for businesses and insurers to reduce worker injuries, particularly cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) such as wrist strain, elbow strain, or the more serious carpal tunnel syndrome. CTDs are a fast-growing category of both occupational illnesses and workers' comp claims, but the severity of the injuries has been exaggerated significantly by the media. (Carpal tunnel syndrome is the seriously debilitating illness so often mentioned, but it accounts for only 1.4 percent of all work injury or illness cases, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Nevertheless, muscle strains caused by repetitive motions or poor posture do cause discomfort and pain, limit mobility, and reduce worker productivity. To address the problem, companies consult ergonomics experts and buy redesigned office furniture and machinery from manufacturers such as Michigan's Haworth Inc., which makes motorized tables that adjust height during the course of a working day, and Nova Office Furniture of Effingham, Illinois, which sells desks with computer monitors built into them so workers peer down at them like newspapers rather than up at them like televisions.<p>
OshKosh B'Gosh, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of children's clothing, used several strategies to reduce CTDs at its main plant in Oshkosh. The company's employees were performing numerous tasks involving small, awkward motions that require force. Inspectors checked the snap crotch of each pair of pants, pinching 600 snaps per hour. Machine operators developed back trauma from twisting and turning heavy garments, and sustained shoulder and hand problems from bending over to reach different-sized clothing.<p>
The company's safety team decided to purchase 7,000 padded, adjustable chairs at $100 each and redesign many of its own machines. Company engineers devised an air-driven, automatic "crotch-snapper." Mechanical "feed dogs" were installed to dig their metal "teeth" into fabric and pull it through sewing machines. Plant workers were encouraged to report minor pain or discomfort so company engineers could address the problems. They were also rotated through several different jobs within plants, to reduce constant stress on one part of the body. After an initial surge in reported injuriesworkers were being told, after all, to report even minor problems more oftenworkers' comp claims fell as did the severity of reported injuries. From 1992 to 1993, workers' comp costs at OshKosh B'Gosh fell by a third, more than paying for the company's safety innovations.<p>
In the search for workplace safety, even industries considered to be "dangerous" have made great strides. Consider the mining industry, which has posted the most dramatic decline in injury rates during the past 20 years. In 1976, mining had the third-highest rate of total injury cases and the highest rate of any industry for injuries with lost workdays. By 1992, its rate of all injuries and of injuries involving lost workdays had dropped below the rates not only for all the other goods-producing industries but also for parts of the service sector. The efforts of enterprises like Kerr McGee Coal Corp.'s Jacob's Ranch Mine in Gillette, Wyoming, have contributed to this impressive record. The mine's incentive program for zero accidents is a quarterly award of $100 in gift certificates from local merchants. For every accident, each of the mine's 400 workers loses $10 from their awards. "Everyone gets penalized so there's a real incentive to wear safety glasses and do the right things," says safety supervisor Lenny Altenburg. The company spends $205,000 a year on the gift certificates, but the investment is paying off: The firm had no lost-time accidents at all from 1991 to 1994. Other mining firms have introduced new technologies, begun safety training programs, and used similar financial-incentive systems to minimize accidents. Compare the mining industry's typical death toll today (97 in 1992, for example) to the 3,500 annual deaths typical in the first part of the century, and you have some idea of the progress that's been made.<p>
Rail safety is another area where the incentives of the private-sector marketplace dwarf those of the public sector. The E.H. Harriman Memorial Awards, given for railroad safety since 1913, helped to illustrate this point in 1994, as privately owned railroads took prizes and publicly owned or publicly subsidized railroads posted mediocre or poor safety records. Among the largest railroads in the country, Norfolk Southern took first place while Amtrak, the federally subsidized national passenger rail system, came in last. Similarly, among nine medium-sized railroads, the three publicly owned lines ranked 5th, 7th, and 9th. Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., which operates lines in New England, won its category (small railroads) despite allegations of safety problems over the past few years by labor unions and federal regulators (whose ranks are dominated by union veterans). Colin Pease, executive vice president at Guilford, explains that while many publicly owned or subsidized railroads rely on "feel-good programs" to promote safety, private lines must operate safely or go out of business. Insurance costs, replacement costs, and disruption of freight deliveries all skyrocket when lines are unsafe. "There is a major economic impact to whether your workers perform their jobs the right way or not," he says. "But the motive breaks down in the public sector." Pease believes that when workers are working safely, they're working productivelyand naturally, in a competitive enterprise like transportation, productivity gains are the only way to stay ahead of competing rail or trucking firms. Guilford supervisors provide daily safety instruction and perform "test and observation" procedures 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<p>
The efforts of these and many other American companies to reduce accidents and injuries are ongoing and massive. But conscious decisions by corporate managers and workers to address safety aren't the only cause of safety gains. Larger trends in the economy, reflecting innovation and productivity gains linked to goals other than safety, have also contributed to lower rates of accidental deaths and safer workplaces. For example, it now takes fewer employees to manufacture goods in Americaand that means fewer chances for injuries and accidental deaths. Also, the quality of medical care provided both at the workplace itself and in hospitals and urgent-care centers has steadily improved, reducing the severity of injuries and the risk of death from accidents. Furthermore, a great deal of recent job growth has occurred among the smallest businesses in the country, which also have tended to post the best safety records (large businesses post the second-best safety records, while medium-sized firms have traditionally reported the most accidents).<p>
While interpreting safety data and identifying causes and effects of particular trends can sometimes be challenging, the overall message about corporate responsibility in this area shouldn't be obscured. Driven by the pressures of the market to lower costs, keep skilled workers, minimize legal and insurance costs, and avoid bad publicity, American businesses have toiled endlessly to make their workplaces safer. <p>
To a large extent, they've done so. In a real sense, the tremendous reduction in accidental deaths accomplished in the past 60 years represents an advance in the quality of life of workers and consumers no less significant than pay raises or price reductions. Horrible accidents such as the Hamlet chicken-plant fire are human tragedies, but in the context of corporate decisionmaking in a market economy they are also economic disasters. That's why responsible firms today are investing so much time and money trying to avoid them.<p>
OSHA, whether upsized or downsized, reengineered or left alone, has little value to add to the worker safety picture. But its costs, measured in lower productivity and wages as well as higher prices and taxes, are significant. This is one more area where Congress needs to rethink the need for federal government involvement.

<p>
Every day, hundreds of travelers and visitors to New York City arrive at 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Station, after a disorienting bus trip from Kennedy or LaGuardia airports. Most of the passengers stepping out onto the sidewalk have a single goal: to find a taxicab. Meanwhile, beside each idling bus awaits another group, equally intent on their own mission: to steal from the disembarking travelers.<p>
These are Grand Central's "bag hustlers," the muggers, swindlers, and con men drawn to the area by the steady stream of bus passengers, as well as by the half-million or so commuters who pass through Grand Central each day. To these men, a confused tourist is like a limping gazelle: slow, defenseless, and tasty.<p>
Early one afternoon, a middle-aged visitor from Austria arrives at 42nd Street. Bags in hand, he scans the street for a cab. Before his eyes can even adjust to the light, he is approached by a bag hustler. The hustler, a stocky man in his late 30s, is confident, aggressive, and talks quickly. He offers to carry the man's bags and find a cab. His $20 fee, he explains, will cover the cost of the ride to the man's hotel. The man assents, unaware that the hustler has no intention of paying for the cab with the $20. Instead, he plans to take the moneyand perhaps the man's entire walletand run into the crowd.<p>
As the two walk together to the curb, a third man appears, dressed in what looks like a policeman's uniform. "Excuse me," he says to the tourist, pointing to the hustler, "do you know this man?" The tourist, looking confused, shrugs. "Then why is he carrying your bags? He's a thief." Soon, other tourists are looking on, and the policeman repeats his charge to the crowd. "This man is a thief," he says in a loud voice, "stay away from him." The hustler drops the bags, and the cop escorts the now thoroughly confused but grateful tourist to a legitimate taxi stand down the block. In less than a minute, and with little fuss, the policeman has saved the tourist from one of New York's oldest scams.<p>
Except the man in uniform is not a policeman. He is a private security guard, hired by local property owners, and possessing no legal powers beyond those of an ordinary citizen. He is a member of a security detail employed by an organization called the Grand Central Partnership. In less than 10 years, this man and several dozen of his colleagues have helped transform the area around the train station from a chaotic maze of threatening streets into one of the safest sections of Manhattan. They have done it without wholesale arrestsand without the use of public money.<p>
Traditionally, security guards have been employed almost exclusively by businesses: either companies whose assets are so valuable that they require extra protection, such as banks and jewelry stores, or those whose size or physical structure renders police patrols ineffective against crime, like hospitals and railroads. But the role of private security is expanding. Increasingly, civilian guards are providing protection in places where only sworn police officers have walked beats: in public parks, central cities, and residential neighborhoods. And increasingly, the salaries of these guards are being paid not by businesses to protect goods, but by citizens hoping to protect their families and neighborhoods.<p>
The history of private security may be nearly as old as crime itself. The earliest security guards may have been the temple priests in the ziggurat at Ur, enlisted by wary Sumerian moneychangers in the third millennium B.C. to protect their lucrative banking operations. In the United States, where businesses have always assumed a large degree of responsibility for protecting themselves, private security guards predate police departments by more than 200 years. Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant and barrelmaker-turned-detective, started the country's first guard-for-hire service in 1860. His first job: dispatching uniformed civilians to protect meat-packing plants in Chicago. Pinkerton's company, which by the 1990s had revenues of more than $600 million, now shares the market with about 57,000 other private security firms in the United States.<p>
Private security is among the fastest-growing industries in the country. During the 1980s, security companies expanded at twice the rate of public law enforcement, and received 70 percent more funds. There are now two security guards employed in the United States for every federal, state, and local police officer. Civilian guards protect everything from nuclear-power plants to theme parks to government buildings, and their role in public life is growing larger. <p>
Private security companies can never take the place of police officers, and most do not want to. Security guards lack the moral authority that only government can give law enforcement. They also are hobbled by law. Civilian guards have only limited powers of arrest. In most states, citizens may make arrests only when a crime is committed in their presence; suspicion that a crime has taken place is not enough. And in some states, citizens may only make arrests for felonies, and then must immediately turn the suspect over to a police officer. Even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution. Unlike police officers, civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects into custody are liable for false arrest. <p>
For these reasons, security guards cannot routinely respond to violent crime. They cannot interrogate suspects or solve murders or negotiate the release of hostages. But they can augment police efforts, helping to maintain order in places where police forces are absent or spread thinly. And they can encourage citizens to follow community standards in a way police officers often cannot.<p>
Security guards can perform these tasks more cheaply than most police departments. Unlike police officers, guards spend nearly all of their time on the job. Since they seldom make arrests, they have little paperwork, and rarely have to testify in court. They are free to walk their beats, andof great importance to employersthey accrue little overtime.<p>
Perhaps most important, security guards are flexible. Because they are not required to respond to calls for emergency service, they can go wherever they are needed to deter crimeand stay there. A business owner who fears robberies cannot force a police officer to stand outside the door of his business. But hired security guards can do just that. Private security gives citizens more control over their own safety. Used intelligently, security guards can be as efficient as any police department at keeping public order.<p><center><b>Law and Disorder</center></b>
<p>
By the mid-1980s, the streets of midtown Manhattan seemed to be sliding into chaos. Aggressive beggars clogged filthy sidewalks. Crimes of all kinds were on the rise. Local business owners became increasingly frustrated with the city's apparent inability to clean up the area. Some companies left Manhattan for good. A cluster of midtown property owners decided to stay, and to restore their neighborhood without the help of City Hall.<p>
In 1985, a group of planners led by real-estate developer Peter Malkin formed a "business-improvement district," a primitive form of quasi-government charged with keeping streets safe and clean. The group carved out a 50-square-block area surrounding Grand Central Station and on the cusp of Times Square. They called it the Grand Central Partnership. The owners of the 220 commercial properties within the district got to vote on the plan, and a majority agreed to join. Soon after, the New York City Council approved the plan. Although the area was not physically vastabout 80 acres of streetsit was in the center of one of the densest commercial districts in the country. Once its boundaries were set, the Grand Central Partnership contained more than 6,000 businesses, comprising a total of some 51 million square feet of commercial space, about the same as in all of downtown Los Angeles.<p>
To raise money for improvements, the property owners began taxing themselves, first at the rate of a little more than 11 cents per square foot of space, later at about 12.5 cents. For small businesses, the levy worked out to a couple of hundred dollars in extra taxes per year. For large properties, such as the PanAm building, the tax could add up to $300,000 annually. Collecting the revenue was easy. A state law passed in 1981 allowed the city of New York to gather the money along with municipal property taxes each year. The city then sent the money back to the partnership. The city threatened property owners who refused to pay with foreclosure. <p>
By 1994, the Grand Central Partnership was raising $6.3 million a year in property taxes. Most of the money went to visible projects. The partnership hired more than 30 street sweepers and trash collectors to pick up after the thousands of litterers who walk through midtown each day. It purchased new garbage cans, street lights and flower boxes, and built new sidewalks and gleaming granite curbs.<p>
To help foreign tourists find their way, the partnership hired multilingual guides and placed them outside of the train station. To make catching a cab easier, it built two taxi stands and stationed a guard in each to direct traffic. To make the neighborhood more inviting to pedestrians, the partnership spent $3 million to install 136 high-power halogen floodlights, which illuminate the Grand Central terminal at night. When more money was needed for capital improvements, the group issued $35 million in bonds, the interest on which was paid for by the property tax.<p>
<b><center>Vacating the Vagrants</b></center>
<p>
Completed in 1913, Grand Central Station was crumbling by the 1980s, and had become a magnet for every kind of social affliction. City police seemed unable or unwilling to restore order. In 1987, the New York Times described the area outside the train station as "chaotic and forbidding, often filthy and sometimes dangerous." Much of the chaos and filth, as well as much of the danger, could be traced to the nearly 500 vagrants living in the building. <p>
Since it had no jurisdiction within the train station, the partnership could not make the vagrants leave the terminal. Instead, it decided to lure them away. For years, hundreds of homeless men and women had gathered on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central to receive food handed out by volunteers. Starting in 1989, the partnership opened a "drop-in center" for the homeless in an old Catholic boys' school a couple of blocks away. Soon, the center was serving meals to hundreds of the same people who had once queued up outside Grand Central.<p>
Inside the old school, the homeless could sit down to eat. And unlike the street in front of the station, the drop-in center was safe, protected by a metal detector and security guards. As additional enticements, the center offered hot showers and job-training classes. Employees of the partnership began to help vagrants living in the train station find more permanent housing, relocating scores of them to shelter at YMCAs and even in city housing. Before long, Grand Central was nearly free of vagrants.<p><b><center>The Shock Troops</b></center><p>
As the partnership's social-service arm enjoyed success with the area's homeless population, its security division worked to assemble a guard force. By the winter of 1988, the security force was ready. Using $1.4 million of its annual revenues, the partnership put 18 uniformed security guards on the street around Grand Central each day, working overlapping shifts from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week.<p>
Gerard Panza is a retired detective who runs the day-to-day operations of the partnership's security force. From his office in a building next to the train station, he plots the movement of crime through the district. On one wall hangs a map of midtown, with colored push pins marking the locations of recent crimes. Though the map is riddled with holes, few pins remain, testament to the success of the partnership's strategy for fighting crime. <p>
At times security guards have tackled serious, violent crime. Guards have disarmed a gunman and also foiled an armed robbery. But as Panza explains, the partnership's most important task is keeping the streets orderly. Security guards, he says, have set out to shove even the pettiest of criminals out of the partnership's domain. No public violation of law or exhibition of disorder is too small to merit the attention of security guards. As a result, Panza says, the incidence of crime of all kinds has fallen. <p>
The New York City Police Department agrees. According to the department's statisticians, within two years after the guards arrived, reports of crime within the Grand Central Partnership had dropped by 20 percent. The decline was even more precipitous in the area immediately surrounding the rail terminal. On the western part of Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Station, a street long famous for muggers and drug dealers, reported crimes dropped 83 percent (from 2,140 in 1988 to 367 in 1990). After three years, reports of crime in the district had dropped 36 percent, an achievement the city's assistant chief of police called "phenomenal." By the spring of 1994, more than five years after security patrol started, reported crime in the Grand Central Partnership had decreased by nearly 53 percent.<p><b><center>A Few Good Men</b></center><p>
The group's directors understood that the guards they hired would do much to shape the partnership's public image. It was a challenging task, because the public perception of private security has never been good. A 1971 Rand report described the "average security guard" as an "underscreened, undertrained, undersupervised, and underpaid" ne'er-do-well with "little education beyond the ninth grade." To this unflattering portrait, the Rand scholars might have added "uncontrollably aggressive" and "psychologically unstable." It is widely believed in the private-security industry that the mentally unbalanced are drawn to guard work. A number of recent, highly publicized incidents in which current and former security guards have committed crimes or gone unaccountably berserk have only seemed to confirm the stereotype. <p>
In order to screen out maladjusted candidates, the Grand Central Partnership advertises the jobs in relatively upscale publications like the New York Times and takes referrals from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. Although no federal laws regulate the hiring practices of private security companies, most states require guards to be at least 18 years old, and to be reasonably upstanding, sober citizens with no recent felony charges. In addition to these requirements, the partnership hires only applicants with a high-school diploma, and gives preference to those with military service. Each recruit is required to take a psychological exam and a drug test. Once they meet these standards, rookie guards are trained for seven days, mostly in the specifics of New York law.<p>
There are no explicit physical requirements for the job, but Richard P. Dillon, who runs the security operation for the partnership, says he likes to hire guards who are "as smart and as big and fast as we can get." In at least one category, it is clear he has succeeded. The partnership's guardsmost of whom are mentend to be physically imposing. Some are huge. The guards do not carry weapons, so physical size can be an important source of authority during an altercation.<p>
Successful applicants are paid well by industry standards. Salaries start at $10 an hour, rising to about $13 with seniority and good service. Benefits include health and life insurance, and two weeks' paid vacation. Once on the force, discipline is strict. Absenteeism and lateness are not tolerated, nor is sloppy dress, smoking in public, or even minor violations of the organization's many rules. Guards must use good manners, including courtesy titles, in their dealings with the public. Their uniforms, which bear a distinct and intentional resemblance to those of the city's police department, are crisp and clean. Under them, guards wear bullet-proof vests. <p><center><b>Tight Supervision</center></b>
<p>
Though they have succeeded in forming a largely professional force, the partnership's directors are under no illusions about the quality of person drawn to guard work, or about what could happen if the guards were managed poorly. Direct and quick communication between guards and supervisors is crucial to ensuring that guards are effective and stay within the bounds of the law. Guards are linked to their supervisors at all times by radios routed through the partnership's dispatching center on 34th Street. As they walk their rounds, guards talk frequently with their overseers, checking in over the radio and seeking approval for any consequential decisions.<p>
The partnership's supervisors are well-equipped to offer guidance. Each is a retired New York City police officer, with a minimum of 20 years on the force. The head of the group's security force, Richard Dillon, was a cop for 32 years before retiring in 1988 as assistant chief of the department. Most other supervisors retired as detectives or inspectors. <p>
Veteran supervisors are the partnership's insurance policy against mishaps. In addition to their superior equipmenteach carries a concealed pistol and a radio with a direct line to the police departmentsupervisors bring a solid knowledge of the penal code. While guards, many of whom aspire to be police officers, are apt to swagger and overstep their authority, supervisors remain cool. William O'Connor, a retired detective who keeps watch over seven guards, says he struggles every day to keep his men within their legal bounds. "They're loaded with enthusiasm, and they would want to do more than private citizens can do." But, as O'Connor reminds his guards repeatedly, they are nothing more than civilians in uniforms.<p>
The distinction is vital. Nothing could destroy Grand Central Partnership's security force more quickly than a guard who assumes police powers and abuses citizens. It has happened before. In the late-1980s, members of the Nation of Islam began providing security to public-housing projects in several cities, including Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. With grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the sect's security firm sent guards into projects to clear out drug dealers. For a time, the group restored a measure of order to the projects. In the process, however, the security guards intimidated not only the drug dealers but residents as well. In a number of housing complexes, police had to intervene to keep the guards under control. In one case, the group lost its contract with a housing project in Los Angeles after being charged with negligence.<p>
In order to avoid similar mistakes, the partnership drills its guards on the limitations on the use of force. Physical force may be used, the guards learn again and again, only as a final resort, in self-defense, or to protect the life of another person. The partnership's security handbook, which explains the limits of civilian authority, is referred to as "the Bible"; guards take refresher courses on it every Thursday afternoon. To further protect themselves from liability suits, guards are required to call their supervisors the moment a problem arises. If the guards make an arrest or become involved in an altercation with a citizen, supervisors routinely interview bystanders as potential witnesses. In the event of a lawsuit, the statements they take may be used to protect the guard. So far, the precaution has not been necessary. The partnership's security force has been sued only once, by a bystander who was injured by a guard chasing a suspect.<p>
The supervisors' broad experience allows them to fill another role as well, that of ambassadors to the city's police. A working partnership between the two groups is vital to the success of the security force, but relations did not come easily. Like most police officers, New York cops are naturally suspicious of security guards, or "square badges," as they are unaffectionately known. In the eyes of police, guards seem to occupy a confusing gray area between public official and private citizen that many cops find disconcerting.<p>
To the surprise of no one, the partnership's guards received a chilly welcome from police when they first arrived in midtown. Due partly to the presence of retired cops in its ranks, however, the guards ultimately developed an amiable relationship with local cops. The two groups now share a substation across from the train terminal, and meet monthly to discuss crime trends.<p><b><center>A Cop's Best Friend</b></center> <p>
Over the years, police have adopted a laissez-faire view of minor lawbreakers around Grand Central, including baggage hustlers, aggressive panhandlers, and small-time marijuana salesmen. "The police are involved with other matters," explains Panza, who spent more than 30 years on the force. "They cannot concentrate on the quality-of-life crimes when they have major crimes. They must first reduce homicides, robberies, assaults."<p>
For police officers, the priorities make good sense. When a cop makes an arrest for disorderly conduct, for instance, he is likely to spend the rest of his shift at the station house filling out forms.<p>
In the meantime, his post out on the streets may remain unfilled, creating opportunities for additional, perhaps more serious crimes to be committed. "That's where we come in," says Panza. "We are the eyes and the ears of the police department. They appreciate our work because we try to solve some problems ourselves, without police intervention."<p>
Guards often go to great lengths to avoid summoning police unnecessarily to the scene of a disturbance. When a knot of marijuana dealers proved especially hard to dislodge, for instance, security guards simply took photographs of the sellers and handed them over to police. Most of the dealers quickly found new retail locations. As in the vast majority of cases handled by the partnership's guards, police never became directly involved. <p>
Of the 6,916 incidents to which the partnership's guards responded in 1994, only 624 required police assistance, and 122 resulted in arrests. That year, guards came across 31 people smoking marijuana in public. In each case, the guards told the smokers to move along, and in each case the smokers did. In cases of narcotics dealing, police were called just 6 percent of the time; in bag-hustling cases, 2 percent; in illegal panhandling cases, 1 percent; and disorderly conduct cases, 9 percent.<p>
In January 1993, security guards told 141 unlicensed peddlers to leave the area. One hundred and thirty-five obeyed the guards without incident. Police were called to handle only six of those cases; only two peddlers were belligerent enough to get arrested.<p>
Most of the time, guards convince violators to comply by explaining which laws they have broken, then politely asking them to leave the area. Most accede. Some do not. <p>
Three-card monte dealers, in particular, have a reputation for ferocity, and only the largest security guards are sent to ask them to vacate the sidewalk. When they are challenged, however, it isn't physical strength most security guards are likely to rely upon, but the power to arrest.<p>
Like all citizens, guards can make arrests when they see crimes committed, hold suspects until the police arrive, and act as complainants in the case against the arrestee. The difference between security guards and most civilians, however, is that guards will, when pushed, actually make an arrest. Most lawbreakers in the area know the guards aren't bluffing.<p>
The threat of even a citizen's arrest is apt to get a wrongdoer's attention. As security chief Richard Dillon puts it, "Criminals, even in New York, where they know they're not going to stay in jail very long, still don't want to be arrested." And, according to Dillon, security guards will make a genuine effort to arrest some criminals. "Our guys chase them five or ten blocks."<p>
When the victims of crime are tourists, security guards make an additional effort to see that the perpetrators are locked up. Visitors from out of town make appealing marks partly because criminals know that even if they are caught, their victims will most likely never return to testify against them in court. The charges will be dropped. To encourage tourists to testify, the partnership authorizes its guards to offer to pay victims' airfare back to New York for the court date. The guards believe this policy makes criminals more inclined to plea-bargain.<p>
<b><center>Deterring Petty Thieves</b></center> <p>
The partnership's guards look strikingly like New York City cops. The resemblance is deliberate. Says Panza, "We want people to think from a distance that it may be a police officer. That is a deterrent. By the time they ascertain that the guy is not a police officer, maybe the opportunity to commit the crime has disappeared." When they are not putting the hustle on bag hustlers, the guards spend their days doing what New York's police department no longer has much time to do: walking a beat and deterring thieves with their uniformed presence. <p>
Coconuts, a music store next to the train station, has lost large amounts of merchandise to theft. Professional shoplifters carry double-walled "booster bags" lined with aluminum to neutralize the store's electronic security system, and they routinely load up with free compact discs and cassette tapes. Store employees, knowing police would be slow to respond, could do little. But the security guards, says Edwin Ortiz, the store's manager, have helped cut down on the thievery. "I call them and they come running and hold the shoplifter till the police come." <p>
Joel Oks, owner of Portabella, a men's clothing store on Vanderbilt Avenue, also had a problem with shoplifters. Now, he says, the thieves have moved on to other areas, along with the drug dealers who used to stand outside his store. The criminals, he claims, have been frightened away by the security guards. "Wouldn't you be scared of this guy?" asks Oks, pointing to Jimmy Mena, a guard the size of a rhinoceros. "We don't have security problems any more. I give them all the credit." <p>
Oks may give the guards credit, but he has no idea how much he gives them in taxes. Like every store owner I surveyed, Oks did not know what he pays each year to the Grand Central Partnership. And like the rest of the owners, he does not seem to care. Whatever the amount, he says, the protection he receives is "well worth it."<p>
Alan Maleh, owner of Goldrush Fine Jewelry at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, agrees. "I haven't seen a uniformed policeman around here in years." The guards, by contrast, "are there all the time. If we give a call, they come running over." Before the security guards, he says, "there were no cops." Muggers "would snatch a purse right in front of the store and they would be laughing, not even running away, walking away. They can't do that now. So they go somewhere else." Without guards, he says, "it's like a jungle out there."<p>
Store owners take comfort in the fact they can reach guards at any time on their portable radios and expect an immediate response. Toni Klein, who owns Cohen's Fashion Optical on 42nd Street, says she does not wait for a crime to occur before calling for help. The moment menacing-looking people enter her store, she requests a guard, who invariably arrives in moments. Like many citizens, Klein might feel foolish calling the police to deter crimes before they are committed. But the money she pays to the partnershipeven though she is unsure of its amountmakes her feel entitled to preventive police protection.<p><b><center>Fresh Flowers in the Men's Room</b></center>
<p>
Perhaps no location in midtown Manhattan has benefited more dramatically from the presence of security guards than Bryant Park, a nine-acre patch of grass  behind the city's public-research library and adjacent to Times Square. Situated in the center of the city and ringed by office buildings, Bryant Park is a natural place for couples to stroll and office workers to eat lunch. For years, however, few dared enter the area. Until the late-1980s, the park was a dangerous and notorious place: Drug-dealing was rampant, people lived on park benches, and there were murders. <p>
Bryant Park's fortunes began to change when two security guards were assigned to the area. The guards started enforcing some simple rules: no panhandling in the park, no drinking, no drugs, no sleeping on the benches, no feeding the pigeons, and no wading in the fountain. For those who didn't get the message, a sign was hung listing the prohibitions in bold letters. Within a short time, many of the park's seedier tenants left for more hospitable terrain. Soon, law-abiding citizens took the place of vagrants, and the atmosphere  began to change. <p>
Bryant Park now hosts concerts during the summer, and free movies on the lawn every Monday night. There is virtually no serious crime. "We're getting so many good folks here doing so many good things," says William O'Connor, who supervises guards in the park." You're an oddball when you're sitting out there being drunk or disorderly."<p>
Nothing illustrates the revival of Bryant Park more powerfully, however, than the condition of its men's room. By their nature, bathrooms are among the most vulnerable of public spaces. In New York, they are often stark symbols of urban decay. Frequently scarred by graffiti, and filled with drug dealers, amorous homosexuals, and vagrants bathing in the sinks, public men's rooms are places most savvy New Yorkers avoid at all costs. <p>
Bryant Park's men's room, however, is different. Its full-time attendant keeps the room tidy and stands guard. As a result of his vigilance, the men's room is as spotless as the lavatory in an upscale restaurant. Next to the sink is a bouquet of fresh flowers, fragrant evidence of the power of private security to enforce order in public spaces.<p>
More communities are certain to follow the example of the Grand Central Partnership. They may have to. Just as rising medical costs have forced hospitals to give more responsibility to nurses, cities may find that sworn police officerswhom they must train, pay relatively well, and sustain on pensionsare too expensive for fighting and deterring certain types of low-level crimes. To maintain basic civic order, rent-a-cops may be a better deal. <p>
Many communities already think so. In 1993, residents of Georgetown, an affluent and historic neighborhood on the western edge of Washington, D.C., hired a security guard from the Wells Fargo Company. Crimes, particularly thefts from cars, had been increasing in the area for years. About 100 neighbors chipped in approximately $160 a yearabout 44 cents a day per householdto hire a uniformed guard to patrol their six-block area. From 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., five nights a week, the guard passes each house in the area at least once every hour.<p>
After a year of employing the guard, residents found their streets transformed. Fresh graffiti stopped appearing on buildings. Burglaries within the six-block area decreased by 55 percent, robberies by 50 percent. The security guard also stopped at least two serious crimes. In one instance, he frightened off two men attempting to kidnap a local couple. <p>
The decrease in crime was so dramatic that other parts of Georgetown soon began hiring guards. Within a year and a half, 90 percent of the neighborhood was covered by security guards.<p>
In the mid-1980s, East Hills, New York, a village of 6,700 on Long Island, hired about 30 uniformed security guards to take the place of sworn police officers. The unarmed guards cruise the streets of East Hills 24 hours a day, reporting crimes to county police, and generally acting as guardians of order. Although the service costs residents an extra $360,000 a year in property taxes, it has remained popular. Local politicians credit the program with reducing the town's burglary rate.<p>
Citizens concerned about disorder in their neighborhoods may find that security guards are the most cost-effective way to make their streets safer. "We don't do homicides, we don't do rapes," says O'Connor of the Grand Central Partnership. "But we do other quality-of-life things. Police are not going to come for an illegal peddler when they're up to their necks in gun runs. That's the reason we're here: We do the work the police have trouble getting to because they're so busy." If the results of these private security firms are any indication, this sort of policing can help restore community lifekeeping everyone less busy worrying about crime and more busy building families and neighborhoods.

<p>
Francis A. Biunno, a Philadelphia trial judge, had just sentenced a murderer to death. He then turned to the courtroom, called on those present to sit down, and asked the public to reflect on the breakdown of our democratic system that had led to the killing.<p>
The murder in question was of a 21-year-old rookie police officer, Daniel Boyle, who stopped a stolen car in North Philadelphia. The driver of the stolen car, Edward Bracey, fired numerous shots through the windshield of the patrol car, hitting the young officer in the head. A police radio tape chillingly captured the fatal shots and the fallen officer's final words. A few days later Danny's father, veteran Philadelphia police detective Patrick Boyle, buried his only son.<p>
This tragedy didn't have to happen. Philadelphia police, Judge Biunno said, had previously arrested Bracey for car theft. Twice Bracey had been released without bail or supervision under terms of an order issued by a federal court. Twice Bracey had failed to show up for trialin fact, he was a fugitive from justice when he killed Officer Boyle. This killing wouldn't have taken place, Biunno suggested, if the federal court hadn't required the defendant's release.<p>
Criticism of a federal court on the part of a local trial judge is highly unusual. But Biunno's statement reflected the anger and frustration that officials in Philadelphia harbor toward a federal order that has wreaked havoc on their city's criminal-justice system. The court order to which Biunno referred places a cap on the number of inmates in Philadelphia prisons, and it sharply restricts the ability of judges to imprison defendants prior to trial.<p>
Last year, the city's judges were forced to release defendants in 15,000 cases. Thanks to the court order, the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justicedefendants who have been charged with a crime but do not even bother to show up for trial. Philadelphia police arrest the same criminals over and over again, only to see them immediately released. In the nine years since the order was approved by Judge Norma Shapiro, of the U.S. District Court, defendants released under federal court order have gone on to commit tens of thousands of crimesincluding thousands of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery.<p>
The federal court's order is technically called a "consent decree," because it was agreed to by a previous mayor of Philadelphia. But it no longer enjoys the consent of the governed. Philadelphia's elected leaders, including its present mayor, its district attorney, and most of its city council, are deeply opposed to the consent decree but powerless to overturn it. Philadelphia may be the home of the Liberty Bell, but the federal consent decree is making a mockery of the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.The Philadelphia prisons, which house defendants before trial and sentenced prisoners, have been the subject of various class-action lawsuits since 1972. Past conditions in the prisons have been unacceptable. Over the years, many experts have observed inadequate medical care that has led to the death of inmates, unsanitary food preparation, vermin infestation, and poor plumbing, ventilation, and heating.<p>
In 1986, these conditions prompted inmates at an old, decrepit facility called Holmesburg Prison to file a lawsuit against then-mayor W. Wilson Goode. The mayor decided to settle the case rather than go to trial. The resulting federal consent decree, agreed to by Goode's lawyers, did nothing to address medical care or other conditions in the city's prisons. Rather, it sought to limit the number of prisoners, and, more important, forbade pretrial detention for defendants accused of broad categories of crime. The architects of the plan apparently presumed that reducing the number of prisoners would improve the prison environment for the remaining inmates.<p>
Instead of individualized bail review, with Philadelphia judges considering a criminal defendant's dangerousness to others or his risk of flight, the consent decree requires a "charge-based" system of prison admissions. Suspects charged with so-called "non-violent" crimes, including stalking, car jacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terroristic threats, and gun charges, are not subject to pretrial detention.<p>
In determining pretrial detention, Philadelphia judges can no longer consider a defendant's prior record, his history of failing to appear in court, his mental-health history, his ties to the community, or his drug or alcohol dependency. These factors become completely irrelevant. A major drug dealer carrying a loaded Uzi and a plane ticket out of the country cannot be detained before trial in Philadelphia.<p>
As a result of this system, Philadelphia has become an especially attractive location for drug dealing. Narcotics agents assigned to the international airport routinely apprehend (and are forced to release) drug couriers, who have been assured that carrying over $100,000 of marijuana to Philadelphia is risk free. One newly arrested drug dealer, knowing that he would be released in a matter of hours, cheerfully gave his pretrial bail interviewer a phone number where he could be reached-in Cali, Colombia. <p>
Another drug dealer, Walter Lewis, unwittingly schooled undercover narcotics officers on the benefits of dealing drugs in Philadelphia. Lewis had been awaiting trial in Philadelphia for drug dealing but had already been released because of the federal consent decree. Undercover narcotics agents from neighboring Montgomery County arranged a narcotics deal on City Line Avenue, the street dividing Montgomery County from Philadelphia. When Lewis arrived, he tried to convince the undercover officers to move the drug deal to the Philadelphia side of the street. He carefully explained that they could all be sent to jail if they stayed in Montgomery County. After the officers refused to move, Lewis mistakenly let greed guide him. He completed the deal, the officers immediately arrested him, and he went straight to jail, where he remained until trial. If the deal had occurred in Philadelphia, he would have been released in a matter of hours. <p>
The consent decree has crippled Philadelphia's already struggling criminal-justice system. Once criminals knew that they could not be detained prior to trial no matter how many times they failed to appear for court, Philadelphia began recording unprecedented fugitive rates. A study conducted by John Goldkamp and Kay Harris, nationally recognized experts on the bail process, found, for example, that 76 percent of all Philadelphia drug dealers become fugitives within 90 days of their arrest. Nationally, only 26 percent of drug dealers become fugitives within one year of their arrest. By comparison, only 3 percent of Philadelphia defendants charged with aggravated assaulta crime not subject to the release provisions of the federal consent decreefail to appear for court.<p>
The skyrocketing fugitive rate has produced a system with more defendants in fugitive status than awaiting trial. In the first six months of 1994, over 11,000 new bench warrants (the arrest document issued when a criminal defendant does not appear for a court hearing) were issued for defendants released under the federal consent decrees, representing 74 percent of all the bench warrants issued during this period. Under the consent decree, the number of fugitives in Philadelphia has nearly tripled from 18,000 to almost 50,000, equivalent to a year's worth of criminal prosecutions. And no wonder: Under the consent decree, state courts are powerless to compel a defendant's appearance in court.<p>
Unfortunately for Philadelphians, the defendants released because of the consent decree do not lay lowthey just keep on committing new crimes. In an 18-month period (1993 and the first six months of 1994), Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because of the consent decree. These defendants were charged with 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.<p>
These crimes cannot all be attributed to the federal consent decree; some defendants would have been released under normal Pennsylvania procedures. But apparently half or more of these crimes could have been prevented. Goldkamp and Harris found that pretrial detainees released under the consent decree committed crimes at more than twice the rate of defendants released under state-court bail programs. Within 90 days of release, 18 percent of federally released defendants were rearrested for new crimes, compared with an 8 percent rearrest figure for comparable state bail programs. <p>
Retailers complain of a sharp increase in shoplifting and robberies by criminals immune from incarceration. In April, Charles Pembroke was released for the fifth time in 1995 because of the Philadelphia prison cap. In the last six months, Philadelphia police have arrested Pembroke three times for retail theft, once for robbing a pharmacy with a starter pistol while threatening to kill the victims, and once for drug dealing. Pembroke has failed to appear for court seven times and, as of this writing, is a fugitive on three of his cases. Philadelphia's criminal-justice system just keeps seeing the same defendants over and over again, but can't do anything until they commit a crime so serious that the consent decree finally permits the prison to admit them.<p>
The consent decree also weakens the effectiveness of programs for criminal defendants who never would have been detained prior to trial. State judges are no longer allowed to sanction those criminal defendants who violate conditions of bail, fail to appear for trial, or commit new crimes. State-court bail programs have atrophied into virtual non-existence. Conditional-release programs providing drug treatment, aimed at lifting new offenders out of their recently acquired lives of drugs and crime, are forced to wait for offenders to become serious criminals with a long-term addiction. <p>
The case of Frederick Hightower vividly demonstrates the absurdity of the consent decree. Hightower was a trained helicopter mechanic from a solid family who became addicted to crack at age 29. He quickly turned to burglaries.<p>
Given Hightower's age, lack of prior criminal-justice contacts, and long-term ties to the community, the local court system (had it remained in charge of the pretrial detention process) probably would have released him without bail for his first two burglaries. But by the time he was arrested for his third burglary, the local judge would have suspected a drug problem, sent him to jail, and permitted his conditional release (again without posting bail) a few days later into an in-patient drug treatment program. If this had worked (admittedly an optimistic outlook) and he had remained in treatment, he would have been a prime candidate for a sentence of probation with the condition of continued drug treatment.<p>
But the federal consent decree wouldn't allow the local criminal-justice system to operate. Without the threat of pretrial incarceration, Hightower wouldn't enter a drug treatment program. Philadelphia wasn't permitted to keep Hightower in jail until he was finally arrested for his 10th burglary. Hightower now was no longer a candidate for probation. Instead he received a 10-year maximum sentence, and must serve a minimum of two and a half years before he is eligible for parole.<p>
The cost of this folly: numerous crime victims with substantial financial losses (and he surely wasn't caught every time); prison bed space occupied longer (a few years, at a cost of approximately $25,000 a year, instead of a few days); increased court costs (each one of his new cases involved police witnesses, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and court personnel), less chance of drug rehabilitation (the treatment came later in his addiction); and loss of tax revenues (Hightower was a skilled, employed taxpayer). <p>
The Philadelphia Federal Courthouse overlooks Independence Hall, the cradle of American liberty and the Constitution. How ironic, then, that the federal court's consent decree tramples on the right of Philadelphians to a democratic political system.<p>
Mayor Ed Rendell and District Attorney Lynne Abraham, both elected Democrats, won office pledging to do what they could to overturn the prison-cap and prisoner-release provisions of the consent decree. Philadelphia's top leaders, including most of the city council, are united in their view that the federal court's rules on pretrial release of defendants are a serious threat to public safety, effectively decriminalizing property crime in Philadelphia, and harming the financial viability of the city. But the federal court has rejected all challenges to the consent decree, and shows no indications of ceding oversight over the issue. Philadelphia's elected leaders are powerless to change agreements made by a prior administration, and so powerless to set their own criminal-justice priorities.<p>
Our democratic system presumes that policies made by today's elected leaders, whether by legislation, regulation, or policy statements, can be altered by their successors in office. Through periodic elections, the public can throw out arrogant public officials who try to insulate their governmental vision from change or from the will of the electorate. Philadelphians do not consent to the consent decree that is destroying their criminal justice system. It's time that Philadelphia's elected leaders be allowed to do the job for which they were elected. Isn't that what America's independence was all about?

Friends of federalism are right to celebrate the recent Supreme Court decision striking down the federal law banning guns on school grounds. While we certainly must work to keep guns out of our schools, this is a state and local concern, one which almost all states already have addressed through their own legislation.<p>
In United States v. Lopez, the court ruled that Congress had relied on an indefensibly broad interpretation of the Constitution's interstate-commerce clause in claiming that possession of a firearm in a school zone could interfere with interstate trade. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that the Gun-Free School Zones Act "is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms."<p>
Though correct in claiming that Congress hadfor nearly 60 yearsused the commerce clause to justify the gradual encroachment of federal power over our lives, conservatives err when they pretend there are no serious threats to interstate commerce legitimately subject to congressional regulation. On the contrary, there is a growing and ravaging menace to interstate commerce that forces good products off the market, stifles innovation, hurts our ability to compete in the world marketplace, and is unjust both to consumers and manufacturers. It is embodied in the uncontrolled liability rulings and legal expenses that characterize the civil-justice system of most states in the nation. Despite conservative fears of legal reform at the national level, true federalists should embrace limited federal tort reform to rescue a court system that is helping to undermine the economic base of numerous businesses and industries.<p>
<center><b>First Principles</center></b>
<p>
We must, however, limit intervention from Washington according to the principles of federalism and with an understanding that the potential risks of national intervention always are high.<p>
When our Founding Fathers met in Philadelphia in 1787 they were faced with two major problems: The Continental Congress was having trouble raising money to conduct a national defense; and the states were engaging in the economically and socially destructive practice of taxing goods coming from all other states. The Framers solved the first problem by giving Congress the power to impose certain taxes. They solved the second by establishing national jurisdiction over interstate commerce, with the aim of promoting what Federalist 11 calls "a free circulation of the commodities of every part" of the union. <p>
Today we face threats to interstate commerce analogous to those faced by the Founders. Interstate commerce is restrained and even stifled by state-based liability rulings and legal transaction costs as destructive as the taxes about which the Founders were so concerned. The clearest example is in product liability, in which rulings and their costs create not a series of competitive state markets, but rather a restrictive, illogical, and inefficient national market. Moreover, we effectively already have a single unitary tort system in the law of products liability. Unfortunately, our unitary system comprises not a coherent, consistent body of laws, but the most commercially restrictive features of the tort laws of individual states. <p>
It is not difficult to see how this has come about: The law of the state in which the alleged harm occurs generally decides tort cases. Yet our market for products is national, so every company must be prepared to be sued in any state in which its product might be used. If a car built and sold in Michigan by a Michigan corporation is in an accident on a California freeway, California's tort law will determine whether the car maker is liable. If the California legislature decides that side air bags are a necessary safety feature, it could impose strict liability on the manufacturer of any car made anywhere in the United States without one.<p><center><b>No Experimenting Here</center></b>
<p>
Michigan cannot prevent this with tort reform. As a result, insurance companies already set their product-liability rates nationally, because under the current system all companies must abide by the law of the state with the strictest rules.<p>
Under these circumstances, how can states serve as "laboratories of democracy" in the area of product liability? No state will know or have any real incentive to find out whether its product-liability "experiment" has succeeded or failed. Why? Because liability costsin the form of higher prices for goods and servicesare spread nationwide. Meanwhile, the benefits of the state's product-liability system flow primarily to its residents, who constitute the vast majority of potential plaintiffs. A state that elects a less costly set of product-liability rules will see the benefits of that system shared by in- and out-of-staters alike, while its residents will continue to pay almost as much for products because of more costly out-of-state tort systems. Congress does not face the same obstacles in enacting product-liability legislation. It, and it alone, can develop a set of national rules designed to maximize the common good whose costs and benefits will be shared by all citizens.<p>
But, while Congress is uniquely qualified to undertake this task, that does not mean that it will in fact perform it well. Legislative efforts might be hijacked by one or another faction, leading to either excessive or insufficient liability being imposed. Indeed, virtually all political scientists and theorists agree that the Framers systematically underestimated the risks of national factions, largely because modern communication has profoundly changed politics.<p>
Nevertheless, product-liability reform presents fewer risks in this area than do most issues. The reason is that the status quo is bad enough that congressional intervention probably will make it better, and is quite unlikely to make it worse. We need federal action because the system is not just broken, it is falling apart.<p><b><center>Personal and Social Costs</b></center> <p>
One obvious problem with our system: It keeps even real victims, who have been injured and need financial help, from collecting their fair share of damage awards. Tillinghast Research reports that 57 cents of every dollar spent on civil suits in this country go to pay lawyers and other legal costs like the public expendses of the court system. <p>
Consumers also suffer. The huge costs of our legal system create a "liability tax" of 2.5 percent on the average product, built into the selling price by manufacturers. The figure is much higher for other products, such as step-ladders (30 percent) and vaccines (95 percent) that tend to attract lawsuits.<p>
In addition to making things more expensive, liability taxes make necessary goods scarce or even unavailable. Lawyer and engineer Peter Huber reports that between 1965 and 1985, the number of U.S. vaccine manufacturers shrank by more than half; by 1986, we relied on a single supplier for vaccines against polio, rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies. Our own Senate Commerce Committee reported that two of the three companies making the Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DPT, vaccine stopped production because of liability costs: They could not afford all the suits arising from the now clearly discredited theory that the vaccine might in very rare instances cause brain damage. <p>
The results of such policies can be devastating, particularly to the sick and helpless. There are some 5,000 diseases that affect small numbers of Americans. Many of these diseases, including leprosy, are extremely serious. But a number of them have gone untreated, because pharmaceutical companies cannot afford the risk. A West German chemical company, for example, at one time supplied Americans with botulinum. A paralytic poison, the drug controls a rare but incapacitating disease that affects the control of eye muscles. The company cut off American supplies to avoid being held liable should people misuse its product.<p>
Dozens of examples like this one prompted the federal government in 1983 to enact the Orphan Drug Act. This act provides special incentives and waivers to companies researching and manufacturing drugs for rare diseases. One of its purposes is to overcome the disincentives to produce needed products that have been built into our legal system, and it has done some good in this area. But orphan drugs are only the most visible signs of a deeper problem. Research and development are undercut when companies are afraid to enter the market for fear of massive, unfounded lawsuits. The result is a lack of innovation and improvement as well as a lack of competition among companiesthat is, a loss of the best means by which to keep quality up and prices down.<p>
The system also hurts our economic competitiveness. A 1994 Business Roundtable survey of 20 major U.S. corporations reveals that they receive 55 percent of their revenue from inside our country, but incur 88 percent of their total legal costs here. Clearly such discrepancies in legal costs put our companies at a disadvantage in the world market. So does our yearly litigation-related costs of $300 billion, or 4.5 percent of our gross domestic product.<p>
Given the nature of the American economy, then, our product-liability system can best be reformed at the national level. We need uniform standards encouraging safe conduct and discouraging frivolous lawsuits aimed only at garnering unjust rewards. In particular, we must limit punitive damage claims and bar joint liability. At the same time, we need a provision holding each defendant accountable for that portion of the damage for which he or she actually was responsible.<p><b><center>State Reforms</b></center>
<p>
Product-liability reform will not address all of our problems, however. The National Federation of Independent Business reports that product-liability reform will help only 35 percent of small businesses. The other 65 percent are not involved in these cases and so will not benefitand even may suffer worse harm by being brought into lawsuits under joint and several liability rules.<p>
Product manufacturers and sellers do not shoulder all of the burden of unjust tort claims and awards. According to Inside Litigation, there were 50 cases in the United States in 1994 in which jury verdicts exceeded $17.5 million. Of these, only seven were product-liability cases. The remaining 43 involved disputes concerning employment, securities, lenders, accountants, environmental claims, insurers, business torts, state and local governments, volunteer firefighters, medical claims, and personal injuries not involving products.<p>
What, then, should we do about these other suits? How should we protect volunteers, lenders, and others from our flawed legal system?<p>
We could devise a national standard for all civil litigation. In this way we could ensure uniformity in standards of conduct and thus much more uniform results. But national standards are neither necessary nor proper, in my view, outside the field of product liability. This is because other types of civil cases do not produce the same disproportionate consequences across states as do product-liability suits. Suits against hospitals are mostly by local patients, suits against volunteer firefighters are mostly by local litigants. Most of the rules for such litigation should properly be determined by the states.<p>
Even so, there are some implications for interstate commerceand therefore grounds for some federal involvement. Some of these lawsuits do involve cross-state litigants, and a dynamic similar to that in product-liability law has led to a systematic bias in favor of plaintiffs that is harmful to interstate commerce. States are unable to protect in-state defendants from unreasonable suits by out-of-state plaintiffs, because the plaintiff in an interstate suit can choose which state to litigate in, and therefore which state's laws apply. By contrast, states can easily establish rules that benefit in-state plaintiffsand they frequently do so. Thus the same pattern the Founders fearedby which state taxes are used against out-of-state goods and interfere with economic productivityis at work.<p><b><center>Ending Windfall Profits</b></center>
<p>
Rather than taking over underlying liability laws, we should use federal power judiciouslyand humblyin order to make modest changes in the structure or legal machinery by which decisions and judgment awards are made. We should replace state law with federal rules, however, only when we are dealing with clear casesbearing in mind the risks, as well as the benefits, of federal action.<p>
Here is my prescription. First, national lawmakers should extend to all civil cases the replacement of joint liability with proportionate liability for non-economic damages. Under the current system, partially responsible parties must pay for more than their fair share of the damages because other defendants have become judgment-proof. For example, in Walt Disney World Co. v. Wood, a woman was injured when her fianc struck the go-cart she was driving at Disney World. The jury found her 14 percent at fault, her fianc 85 percent at fault and Disney only 1 percent at fault. But, under the doctrine of joint liability, Disney was required to pay 86 percent of the plaintiff's claimed damages.<p>
Second, the existing structure of punitive damages is rife with abuse. The courts have rightly regarded punitive damages as the equivalent of a state-imposed fine. Huge punitive damage awards can put a company or individual into bankruptcy. Such awards are meant to be rare and aimed only at particularly egregious conduct. They also are supposed to be awarded only in addition to economic and non-economic damages.<p>
Yet Yale Professor George Priest reports that punitive damage claims have become "almost routine." According to Professor Priest, lawyers increasingly use punitive damage claims to bully even innocent defendants into settling cases for higher amounts. Our high and unpredictable punitive damage claims thus encourage litigation because in too many cases they produce "windfall profits"huge unearned rewards.<p>
A federal cap on punitive damages at some reasonable level would take nothing essential away from the plaintiff. It would, however, protect defendants and society from unfair and financially disastrous awards. These awards hurt all of us by raising prices for goods and services, sometimes so high as to make them effectively unavailable. They hurt, even bankrupt, small businesses in particular, and so cost jobs.<p><center><b>Rediscovering Discovery Costs</center></b>
<p>
Finally, we must do something about the enormous transaction costs incurred under the present system, which nobody can defend. Eighty percent of the cost of the average lawsuit is incurred during discovery. Sifting through documents, taking depositions and so onall of these practices consume massive amounts of time and money. And discovery costs relate as much to issues of courtroom tactics as to actual questions of fault and damage. The process is so costly because attorneys seek to "discover" absolutely everything about their opponents that might possibly be useful in the battleground of the courtroom. <p>
One way to attack this problem would be to change the incentives in the system to encourage parties to settle their disputes early. By encouraging settlement before discovery is complete, we will save everyone a great deal of time, money, and aggravation.<p>
How can we do this without infringing on anyone's right to full compensation? No one wants to deny any Americans the right to their day in court if they feel they are not being fully compensated for their damages. But just as surely, none of us wants to continue with the wasteful, unfair status quo.<p>
We should reward defendants for making full and fair offers early on, without declaring that the plaintiff must accept just any offer. We should increase and speed up recoveries for meritorious claimants. At the same time, we should reduce both the incentives of defendants to drag out these disputes through whatever means available and the costs of those recoveries to defendants.<p>
The method would be simple: Provide protection to defendants who quickly promise to pay the plaintiff's full economic damages, plus, perhaps, an additional amount set by a state schedule based on the severity of the injury. This helps plaintiffs by restoring in full their economic losses without months or years of legal struggle. It helps defendants by protecting them against unlimited non-economic damages claims if they make a fair offer early on. <p>
Faced with such a system, defendants will offer fair compensation more quickly, and plaintiffs will be less likely to turn down a fair offer. Both sides would benefit from early settlements by avoiding long, expensive, and perhaps unsuccessful litigation. Thus lawyers and litigants no longer would hold out for more money and higher fees unless they clearly are warranted. And defendants and their insurance companies would no longer drag out litigation in hopes of making plaintiffs give up their suits and go away. <p>
All of these reforms will increase the fairness and efficiency of our legal system. Moreover, all are amply justified under federalist principles by the peculiar incentives in our present systemincentives that encourage states to develop laws benefiting in-state plaintiffs at the expense of the public interest.<p><b><center>A Federalist Escape Clause</center></b>
<p>
We still should take care to protect and nurture federalism, however. In the case of my early-offer recommendation, for example, I would allow a state to opt out of the federal reformin whole or in partfor disputes entirely between citizens of that state. This would encourage those states that feel strongly about the issue to retain their own legal machinery, but only if they can justify to their own people that the machinery is sound and only if its costs and benefits are allocated to their own citizens.<p>
Some may not be convinced that other reforms (including barring of joint liability and punitive-damage caps) are justified by federalist principles. These people should consider going along with the reforms, but attaching a state opt-out provision. If a large number of states opts out of a particular reform under these circumstances, it would serve as a strong signal to Congress and the people that the national "reform" may in fact have been the product of national faction, rather than a necessary preemption of an illegitimate burden imposed by the states on interstate commerce. <p>
An escape mechanism of this sort could also be useful in other areas beyond legal reform, where there are legitimate differences of opinion on whether federal intervention is needed or desirable. In particular, Congress should consider allowing this opt-out provision whenever it exercises its commerce power to remove burdens on interstate commerce caused by a systemic bias that state competition cannot correct (see Easterbrook, "Madison, the State, and Public Choice," University of Chicago Law. School Record [Spring 1995]). Professor Akhil Amar also suggested an inquiry along these lines in a conversation with a member of my staff. If widely used by the states to evade provisions of federal law, the provision also would help us identify areas in which Congress was wrong to intervene, because the burden imposed on interstate commerce was in fact a legitimate state interest.<p>
This leads us back to Lopez. I have no doubt that civil-justice reforms crafted along the lines I have discussed would pass muster with the Supreme Court. The link between the legislation and interstate commerce would be quite clear. In addition, an opt-out feature of the sort I have described would eliminate cases in which there is no real connection between interstate commerce and the practice in question. Finally, an escape provision for close caseswhere there is some reason to believe that competition among the states' legal regimes is not functioning properly, but the evidence is not overwhelmingwould allow the system to send a useful signal to the Court. It would show that the underlying law was intended as a legitimate exercise of Congress's power to alleviate perverse burdens on interstate commerce, and not as a grab for power in the interests of some national faction.

<p>
Every morning for seven years, Linda Desrosiers  packed her lunch before heading to work as a high-school cook. "I wouldn't touch the food they had us make," she says. "People looked at it and smelled it, but no one ate it."<p>
School janitors in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, an impoverished textile-mill town, confirm Desrosiers's stories of platefuls of grayish green beans and "beef surprise" winding up in the dumpster. One janitor said he changed the high school's industrial-sized garbage bags at least twice in each of the three lunch periods. <p>
In recent months, liberals led by President Clinton have argued that the federal school lunch program "ain't broke" and shouldn't be fixed. They argue, persuasively, that kids who are hungry won't learn. But they also make the false assumption that students actually eat the meals that the government subsidizes. Rhode Island is proving that students' nutrition levels can improve dramatically when subsidies for school meals are slashed.<p>
This academic year, the state of Rhode Island radically reformed its school-lunch program by dumping a quarter-century of centrally planned purchasing, hiring, and cooking. The state cut its $11-million school-lunch appropriation to less than $200,000 and fired all but 11 of the 780 workers who administered, cooked, and served the lunches. Now, private food-service contractors like Marriott and ARA Corp. plan the menus and feed the students. The school districts still get reimbursement from Washington, but the federal money is sent directly to the local districts on a per-meal basis. As a result, combined federal and state subsidies have fallen from more than $23 million in 1993-94 to $12 milliona 48 percent cut. <p>
The result: Kids are eating better. In the past seven months, student participation in school-lunch programs has soared, nutrition levels have risen to among the best in the nation, and poor school districts like Woonsocket are generating a profit.<p>
Brandon Powers, a sixth-grader at Woonsocket Elementary School, says the only downside of the privatized system is that it has put an end to daily "school-slop sculpture contests." "Now the food is pretty good," he says, "so people prefer to eat it rather than build with it." Even Desrosiers, now a cook for Marriott, eats it every day.<p>
Students at North Smithfield High School now eat their hamburgers instead of conducting experiments on the effects of mustard, catsup, and relish on burger flight. And students at a magnet high school in Providence no longer request extra gravy with their mashed potatoes just to provide greater contrast for finger-painting with their food. <p>
School officials back up students' claims that they are eating more. Since a private contractor took over Woonsocket High School's lunch program, janitors haul away 75 percent less garbage from the school cafeteria. Irene Scripsack, the business manager for the North Smithfield school district, says her janitors only collect 5 percent as much garbage as they used to. Scripsack won't say how often she ate the state's food, but admits it was "quite rare."<p>
"The state-run program suffered from what I call 'orange-ravioli syndrome,'" says John Caparco, the principal of Woonsocket High School. "Just providing food students should eat does not mean they'll eat it.  They were simply out to lunch when it came to making the food appealing." Caparco admits even he didn't eat the old food. "Now I get it all the time."<p>
Ellen McKenna, a junior dietetics major at the University of Rhode Island, demonstrated that plate waste was cut dramatically at schools that used private contractors. For instance, she found that most of the hot-food trays were "completely cleared of food" before they were emptied in the trash at Marriott's Potter-Burns Elementary School cafeteria in Pawtucket, where 32 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Likewise, at ARA's Central Falls Elementary School, where 89 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, students ate almost all of their carrots, breads, burritos, and sandwiches. <p>
At the state-run cafeteria at Lonsdale Elementary School in Lincoln, a wealthier community where the state-administered program had not yet been phased out, students were "picking at their food," rather than eating it. On the majority of the trays, most or all of the rice, bread, and fruit had been left uneaten. McKenna reports that students had difficulty identifying the food, and tended to push it around the tray rather than eat it. For instance, one student said he couldn't identify his ham-salad sandwich. McKenna described it as a "pink mush on a roll."<p>
After privatization, not only are students eating more of the meals on their trays, but more of the kids are buying meals.  In Woonsocket, for instance, where more than 77 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, participation has soared under Marriott's direction. During the 1991-92 school year, this "severe-need" district served 2,652 lunches a day. Now it averages 3,486 lunches dailya 31 percent increase. Similarly, under the state-run system, Woonsocket only served 288 breakfasts daily; now it serves 597a 107 percent increase.<p>
Woonsocket is the rule, not the exception. In Providence, where more than 70 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price meals, participation has increased 22 percent since a private vendor took over the cafeterias. And wealthy school districts, like North Smithfield, have recorded 25 percent more students eating school lunches since the state system folded.<p>
Between bites of a chicken-patty sandwich, Pauline Goin says she and her friends rarely bought lunch when the state ran the cafeteria, because the food was always a mysteryin both appearance and taste. "The other stuff was, you know, welfare food, and it tasted like it," the sixth-grader says bluntly. "This stuff is regular foodyou know, for humans."<p>
Greater participation seems to improve discipline during the once-raucous lunch period. Woonsocket's Caparco says that the time his office spends handling discipline problems has been cut by about 20 percent. "If the kids are eating, it's harder to be fighting," Caparco notes.<p><b><center>Have It Your Way</b></center>
<p>
Ruth Eshelman, a nutrition professor at the University of Rhode Island, says that options are essential to students' satisfaction. "If I have a choice, I am much more likely to eat what I choose," Eshelman said. "If I have to eat carrots, they will be terrible, but if I pick carrots over green beans, the carrots might be wonderful."<p>
The state-run school lunch program offered no choice. Each week, newspapers across the state printed the upcoming menu with a total of five listingsthe entire state had one option each school day. Private vendors, on the other hand, offer about 20 alternatives daily. Woonsocket High School students, for instance, can now choose from five meats, several cheeses, and two kinds of bread in the deli line. They can also pick from a list of three or four hot sandwiches, two salads, and a pasta dish. In addition, the menu offers pizza and burritos. Even if the student tires of these regular items, several specials are offered each day. Students also choose from a selection of fresh fruit and vegetables at every meal. And parents are sent a monthly menu describing each day's choices and their nutritional value.<p>
Private vendors also increase participation by using name brands: Pizza is supplied by a local Domino's franchise, and burritos are cooked according to a Taco Bell recipe. The name-brand packaging and advertising raise the likelihood that students will actually like the meal.<p>
Private vendors recognize that student involvement is vital to customer satisfaction. In Woonsocket and Providence, groups of students and parents meet monthly with Marriott's food-service directors. Dina Dutremble, Woonsocket's business manager, says the state never responded to local concerns; private contractors, on the other hand, conduct weekly taste-tests. <p>
Sandra Caron, a senior at Woonsocket High School who is a vegetarian, says that these meetings have allowed her to buy her lunch at school for the first time. After explaining to the food-service director that she and several other students would be willing to buy lunch if vegetarian entres were more readily available, the company promised to look into it. "I suspected they would do what had always happened. Nothing ever happens," Caron says. "But within two weeks, there was a vegetarian item on the menu every day."<p>
Ellen Haas, a USDA official who supervises the school lunch program from Washington, doesn't trust the private sector. She insists that devolution to local districts, like Rhode Island's privatization initiative, will lead to "short-term malnutrition and a lifetime of serious and costly health problems." Her fears were echoed by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who equated devolution to "a dagger pointed at the hearts of our children." But a careful review of nutritional data demonstrates that Rhode Island's new, private programs outperform its state-run lunches. Haas's office did not return several phone callls.<p>
Current USDA regulations require that school lunches provide at least a third of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of seven nutrientsranging from vitamins A and C to iron and thiamin. Rhode Island's state-run school-lunch program, however, did not meet these minimums. Bethany Algier, a nutritionist with Rhode Island's Department of Health, notes that a 1991 nutritional audit of the school-lunch program found that  the state's program fell short in vitamin C and iron and did not meet the target for calories. Plus, this audit assumed implausibly that the students were eating everything on their trays. Although liberals can speak of the value of mandating nutrition levels, Rhode Island demonstrates that these mandates are not even enforced, and it is impossible to ensure the students will even eat the food.<p>
The private vendors, however, combat both these flaws by providing more nutritious meals that the students actually want to eat. According to the Department of Health's nutritional audit, Marriott's menus exceed the state's program by at least three-fold in each of the RDA's seven nutrient categories. In fact, the private-sector program provides students with more than double the RDA of vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A600 percent of the federal minimum for school lunches.<p>
In addition to the RDA nutrients, the private vendors' meal plans have less fat, cholesterol, and sodium and more fiber than Rhode Island's state-run program. Over a 10-week period, the average Marriott lunch contained 33 percent less fat, 40 percent less cholesterol, and 40 percent less sodium than the state's lunches. Marriott's average lunch contained only half the saturated fat and twice the fiber of a government lunch.<p>
Desrosiers and other cafeteria workers don't find these numbers surprising. In the private kitchens, fruits and vegetables rarely come from the can, since the two leading companies, ARA and Marriott, can use their buying power to get price breaks on more nutritious fresh and fresh-frozen produce. In North Smithfield, the independent school-lunch program has promised parents that it will never deep-fry a single item it sells; it even uses low-fat mozzarella cheese on its pizza. This district's hamburger meat contains about 15 percent fat, while the state-run program never used beef with less than 30 percent fat.<p>
Most remarkable, however, is that private vendors don't just provide healthier meals that students will eat, they do it at a profit. Like discount book chains, Marriott and ARA make money selling a high-quality product cheaply by counting on high volume. The per-meal federal reimbursement formula gives the contractors an incentive to provide nutritious meals that kids will like, because the more meals they induce kids to buy, the greater their margins beyond fixed costs. So far, the strategy has paid off.<p>
The secret to making it all work is the plan's clever payment system. The complicated arrangement provides the private contractor with an incentive to feed more students and allows the school district to keep most of the profits. School districts pay the contractor an annual fee to run the program. This fee pays for everything from capital improvements to salaries and food. The school district then keeps all the money the students pay. In addition, the district keeps all of the per-meal subsidies Washington sends it. If these revenues fall short of the district's payment to the private contractor, the contractor assumes the loss. This way, the district can't lose money and the contractor has an incentive to keep costs down while serving more meals. If the district turns a profit, the contractor gets a small cut.<p>
Dutremble, the business manager for the Woonsocket School District, says that the school lunches were a daily headache under the state-run program. While the state provided all of the workers, menus, and food, her district had to pay for high-priced food-service equipment out of its local operating budget. These costs were often so high that some school districts could not afford "sneeze guards" in their serving lines.<p>
Under Marriott's direction, the program is self-sufficient and has already turned a $42,000 profit this year, most of which the district keeps. In Woonsocket, the money is being used to purchase a new $30,000 dishwasher and a truck to deliver meals more efficiently to the elementary schools. Providence's program will profit by more than $100,000 this year, and North Smithfield was $5,000 in the black as of January 1. <p>
In addition, fears that poor or small school districts would be ignored by private vendors are unfounded. In fact, poorer school districtssuch as Woonsocket and Providenceare considered more desirable contracts for private vendors. These students are less likely to bring a lunch than their more affluent peers and therefore participation rates rise more dramatically when the food improves. Small school districts in Rhode Island joined together to negotiate joint competitive contracts. Lastly, the state limits the threat of corruption by putting the program out for bid frequently. Rhode Island prohibits  school-lunch contracts of more than a year, and limits the number of renewals.<p>
Rhode Island's experiment with privatized school lunches is the brainchild of a state legislator, Paul Crowley. A restaurant owner, Crowley was appalled to discover wages in state-run cafeterias were more than $4 per hour higher than at private restaurants, while nutrition levels were substandard. <p>
For years, Crowley's efforts to privatize the program were blocked by state-employee unions. Two years ago, however, Crowley found that the Providence school board had conducted a study showing that a private vendor would save the district more than $600,000 a year. School officials there said they abandoned plans to privatize their program under union pressure. Crowley said the unions even sent busloads of lunch workers to their meetings. After public hearings, Crowley amended the state's Fiscal Year 1995 budget to phase out the school-lunch program this school year. Under the new system, local school districtsrather than the stateare reimbursed directly from the federal government. As in all states, students pay some, all, or none of the lunch cost depending on their parent's income; Washington coughs up the rest.<p>
"We should be in the business of teaching, not feeding," Crowley says. "If other people make a better mousetrap, it makes more sense to buy theirs than build your own." <p>
Although school-district officials universally praise the private-sector lunch program, some are concerned about the GOP's block-grant proposal. Providence officials, for instance, expect the district-wide student body to increase by at least 800 kids next year, and fear that the block grant will not cover extra meals. But Crowley claims the program will still thrive under the block grant proposal. As a district's population increases, more students will buy meals. Since private contractors get paid on a per-meal basis, a larger student body would compensate for a reduction in per-student dollars.<p>
Rhode Island is evidence that converting federal funds to block grants can only improve the nation's school-lunch program. Given full responsibility for the programs, Crowley predicts more states will turn to innovative private alternatives that cost less and maintain higher standards.<p>
In fact, Crowley believes if school lunches had been devolved years ago, Rhode Island would have privatized sooner. "We have found that local districts are best off when they handle this on their own," Crowley said. "Blockgranting can only help us continue on this path."

Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interestsor even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agendaas we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quoincluding the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying effortsbut such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.
<p>

You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.
<p>

You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs -- victory in spite of all terrors -- victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.
<p>
<I>-- First address to the House of Commons as Prime Minister</i><br> 
May 13, 1940
<p>

I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necesary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government -- every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, weshall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

Yesterday, December 7, 1941-- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.
<p>

 As commander in chief of the army and navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
<p>

No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.
<p>

I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
<p>

Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
<p>

With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.

I have just returned from Berlin, the city from the which the Germans intended to rule the world. It is a ghost city. The buildings are in ruins, its economy and its people are in ruins.
<p>

War has indeed come home to Germany and to the German people. It has come home in all the frightfulness with which the German leaders started and waged it.
<p>

The German people are beginning to atone for the crimes of the gangsters whom they placed in power and whom they wholeheartedly approved and obediently followed.
<p>

We also saw some of the terrific destruction which the war had brought to the occupied countries of Western Europe and to England.
<p>

How glad I am to be home again! And how grateful to Almighty God that this land of ours has been spared!
<p>

We must do all we can to spare her from the ravages of any future breach of the peace. That is why, though the United States wants no territory or profit or selfish advantage out of this war, we are going to maintain the military bases necessary for the complete protection of our interests and of world peace.
<p>

Our victory in Europe was more than a victory of arms. It was a victory of one way of life over another. It was a victory of an ideal founded on the rights of the common man, on the dignity of the human being, on the conception of the State as the servant -- and not the master -- of its people.
<p>

A free people showed that it was able to defeat professional soldiers whose only moral arms were obedience and the worship of force.
<p>

We tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war the most powerful nation in the world -- the most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not in the sense some of us believe it to be true.
<p>

The war has shown us that we have tremendous resources to make all the materials for war. It has shown us that we have skillful workers and managers and able generals, and a brave people capable of bearing arms.
<p>

All these things we knew before.
<p>

The new thing -- the thing which we had not known -- the thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society of self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other kind of society, however disciplined, however centralized.
<p>

We know now that the basic proposition of the worth and dignity of man is not a sentimental aspiration or a vain hope or a piece of rhetoric. It is the strongest, most creative force now present in this world.
<p>Now let us use that force and all our resources and all our skill in the great cause of a just and lasting peace! ...

My fellow countrymen, today the guns are silent. A great tragedy has ended. A great victory has been won. The skies no longer rain death -- the seas bear only commerce -- men everywhere walk upright in the sunlight. The entire world is quietly at peace. The holy mission has been completed, and in reporting this to you, the people, I speak for the thousands of silent lips, forever stilled among the jungles and the beaches and in the deep waters of the Pacific which marked the way. I speak for the unnamed brave millions homeward bound to take up the challenge of that future which they did so much to salvage from the brink of disaster.
<p>

As I look back on the long tortuous trail from those grim days of Bataan and Corregidor, when an entire world lived in fear, when democracy was on the defensive everywhere, when modern civilization trembled in the balance, I thank a merciful God that He has given us the faith, the courage, and power from which to mold victory.
<p>

We have known the bitterness of defeat and the exultation of triumph, and from both we have learned there can be no turning back. We must go forward to preserve in peace what we won in war.
<p>

We stand in Tokyo today reminiscent of our countryman, Commodore Perry, 92 years ago. His purpose was to bring to Japan an era of enlightenment and progress by lifting the veil of isolation to the friendship, trade, and commerce of the world. But, alas, the knowledge thereby gained of Western science was forged into an instrument of oppression and human enslavement. Freedom of expression, freedom of action, even freedom of thought were denied through suppression of liberal education, through appeal to superstition, and through the application of force.
<p>

We are committed by the Potsdam Declaration of Principles to see that the Japanese people are liberated from this condition of slavery. It is my purpose to implement this commitment just as rapidly as the armed forces are demobilized and other essential steps taken to neutralize the war potential. The energy of the Japanese race, if properly directed, will enable expansion vertically rather than horizontally. If the talents of the race are turned into constructive channels, the country can lift itself from its present deplorable state into a position of dignity.
<p>

To the Pacific Basin has come the vista of a new emancipated world. Today, freedom is on the offensive, democracy is on the march. Today, in Asia as well as in Europe, unshackled peoples are tasting the full sweetness of liberty, the relief from fear.
<p>

In the Philippines, America has evolved a model for this new free world of Asia. In the Philippines, America has demonstrated that peoples of the East and peoples of the West may walk side by side in mutual respect and with mutual benefit. The history of our sovereignty there has now the full confidence of the East.
<p>

And so, my fellow countrymen, today I report to you that your sons and daughters have served you well and faithfully with the calm, deliberate, determined fighting spirit of the American soldier and sailor based upon a tradition of historical trait, as against the fanaticism of any enemy supported only by mythological fiction, their spiritual strength and power has brought us through to victory. They are homeward bound -- take care of them.

We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.
<p>

These are the boys of Pointe de Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.
<p>

Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet, you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.
<p>

The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that there is a profound, moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
<p>

You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you. 
<p>

The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of invasion was spreading through the darkness back home. They fought -- or felt in their hearts, though they couldn't know in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4 a.m., in Kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying, and in Philadelphia they were ringing the Liberty Bell.
<p>

Something else helped the men of D-Day: their rock-hard belief that Providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an ally in this great cause. And, so, the night before this invasion, when Colonel Wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer he told them: Do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see God and ask His blessing in what we're about to do. Also that night, General Matthew Ridgeway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God made to Joshua: "I will not fail thee nor forsake thee."
<p>

We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent. But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation. In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union, so, together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever....

...[N]ow we stand triumphant, for the third time in this century, this time in the wake of the cold war. As in 1919 and 1945, we face no enemy menacing our security....
<p>

The values we hold dear as a nation -- equality of opportunity, freedom of religion and speech and as-sembly, free and vigorous elections -- are now revered by many nations. Our greatest victory in World War II took place not on the field of battle, but in the nations we once counted as foes. The ideals of democracy and liberty have triumphed in a world once threatened with conquest by tyranny and despotism.
<p>

Today we celebrate the world's evolution toward freedom, we commemorate democracy's fallen heroes, the defenders of freedom as well as victims of dictatorship who never saw the light of liberty. Earlier this year, when former adversaries joined us in the stand against aggression in the Persian Gulf, we affirmed the values cherished by the heroes of the Harbor.
<p>

The friends I lost, that all of us lost, upheld a great and noble cause. Because of their sacrifice, the world now lives in greater freedom and peace than ever before. It is right that all of us are here today. And it is right that we go on from here.
<p>

I have no rancor in my heart towards Germany or Japan, none at all. And I hope, in spite of the loss, that you have none in yours. This is no time for recrimination. World War II is over. It is history. We won. We crushed totalitarianism. And when that was done, we helped our enemies give birth to democracies. We reached out, both in Europe and in Asia. We made our enemies our friends, and we healed their wounds. And in the process, we lifted ourselves up.

The lessons of the war itself will live on, and well they should: Preparedness; strength; decency and honor; courage; sacrifice; the willingness to fight, even die, for one's country -- America, the land of the free and the brave.
<p>

No, just speaking for one guy, I have no rancor in my heart. I can still see the faces of fallen comrades, and I'll bet you can see the faces of your fallen comrades too, or family members. But don't you think they're saying, "Fifty years have passed; our country is the undisputed leader of the free world, and we are at peace."? Don't you think each one is saying, "I did not die in vain."?
<p>May God bless each of you who sacrificed and served....

<P>"The framers of the Constitution were great clockmakers in the science of statecraft, and 
they did, with admirable ingenuity, put together an intricate machine, which promised to 
run indefinitely, and tell the time of the centuries."</P>

<I>--James M. Beck,<BR>
Solicitor General of the United States, 1925-28</I></P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE = "+3">I</FONT>n 1800, when the nation's capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, 
D.C., all of the paperwork and records of the United States government were tightly 
packed into 12 boxes, and then transported the 150 miles to Washington on a horse and 
buggy. That was truly an era of lean and efficient government. </P>
<P>	In the early years of the Republic, government bore no resemblance to the 
colossal empire it has evolved into today. In 1800, the federal government employed 
3,000 people and had a budget of less than $1 million ($100 million in today's dollars). 
That's a far cry from today's federal budget of $1.6 trillion and workforce of 3 million.</P> 
<P>	Since its frugal beginnings, the U.S. federal government has come to subsidize 
everything from research into Belgian endives to maple-syrup production to the 
advertising of McDonald's french fries in Europe and Japan. In a recent moment of high 
drama before the Supreme Court, during oral arguments involving the application of the 
interstate-commerce clause of the Constitution, a bewildered Justice Antonin Scalia 
pressed the solicitor general to name a single activity or program that our modern-day 
Congress might undertake that would fall outside of the bounds of the Constitution. The 
stunned Clinton appointee could not think of one.</P> 
<P>	To win the epic battle over the budget that is now looming on Capitol Hill, this is 
precisely the type of question that fiscal conservatives need to start asking. It is 
instructive that during the entire debate over the controversial 1994 Crime Bill, not a 
single Republican rose up on the House or Senate floor and attacked the $10 billion in 
social spending on the grounds, not that it was wasteful, but that most, if not all, of it is 
simply not the proper responsibility of the federal government. Conservatives should 
have been asking the question: Where is the authority under the Constitution for 
Congress to spend money on midnight basketball, modern-dance classes, self-esteem 
training, and the construction of swimming pools?</P> 
<P>	In other words, fiscal conservatives need to go beyond making the case that 
government wastes money--which it surely does--and start making the case that most 
federal spending today is illegitimate because it lies outside Congress's spending powers 
under the Constitution.</P> 
<P>	The idea is not radical, nor is the strategy futile. For the first 150 years of this 
nation's history, proponents of limited government in Congress and the White House 
routinely argued--with great success--a philosophical case against the creation and 
expansion of federal social-welfare programs.</P>
<P>	There are critical lessons here for Newt Gingrich and his allies in their crusade to 
radically downsize government and topple the "old world order" in Washington. </P>
<P>	The U.S. Constitution is fundamentally a rulebook for government. Its guiding 
principle is the idea that the state is a source of corruptive power and ultimate tyranny. 
Washington's responsibilities were confined to a select few enumerated powers, 
involving mainly protecting the national security of the nation and preserving public 
safety. In the realm of domestic affairs, the Founders foresaw limited federal interference 
in the daily lives of its citizens. The minimal government involvement in the domestic 
economy that was envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution would be financed and 
delivered at the state and local levels. </P>
<P>	The enumerated powers of the federal government to spend money are defined in 
the Constitution under Article I, Section 8. These powers include the right to "establish 
Post Offices and post roads; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; 
declare War;" and other activities related mostly to national defense.</P> 
<P>	No matter how long one searches through the Constitution, it is impossible to find 
any language that authorizes at least 90 percent of the civilian programs that Congress 
crams into the federal budget today.</P>
<P>	There is no granting of authority for the federal government to pay money to 
farmers, run the health-care industry, impose wage and price controls, give welfare to the 
poor and unemployed, provide job training, subsidize electricity and telephone service, 
lend money to businesses or foreign governments, or build parking garages, tennis courts, 
and swimming pools. The Founders did not create a Department of Commerce, a 
Department of Education, or a Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was 
no oversight: they simply never imagined that government would take an active role in 
such activities.</P>
<P>	Recognizing the propensity of governments to expand, and, as Jefferson put it, for 
"liberty to yield," the Framers added the Bill of Rights as an extra layer of protection of 
the rights of individuals against the state. The Bill of Rights was inserted to ensure that 
government would never grow so large that it could trample on the individual and 
economic liberties of American citizens. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution states 
the Founders `intentions quite clearly and unambiguously: "The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people." Such plain language would not seem to be easy to misinterpret. Put simply, if the 
Constitution doesn't specifically permit the federal government to do something, then it 
doesn't have the right to do it.</P>
<P>   The original budget of the U.S. government closely reflected the founder's vision. The 
very first appropriations bill passed by Congress consisted of 111 words--not pages, 
mind you, words. The main expenditures went toward paying the costs of the military, 
including $137,000 for "defraying the expenses" of the Department of War, $190,000 for 
retiring the debt from the Revolutionary War, and $95,000 for "paying the pensions to 
invalids." As for domestic activities, $216,000 was appropriated (or roughly what the 
domestic agencies spend in 15 seconds today!).</P>
<P>	Even expenditures for the most charitable of purposes were routinely spurned as 
illegitimate. In 1794, James Madison wrote disapprovingly of a $15,000 appropriation for 
French refugees: "I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution 
which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of 
their constituents." </P>

<P>	This view that Congress should follow the original intent of the Constitution was 
restated even more forcefully on the floor of the House of Representatives two years later 
by William Giles of Virginia, who condemned a relief measure for fire-victims. Giles 
insisted that it was not the purpose nor the right of Congress to "attend to what generosity 
and humanity require, but to what the Constitution and their duty require."</P> 
<P>	
In 1827, the famous Colonel Davy Crockett was elected to the House of 
Representatives. During his first term of office, a $10,000 relief bill for the widow of a 
naval officer was proposed. Colonel Crockett rose in stern opposition and gave the 
following eloquent rebuttal to the bill:</P>

<UL>	"We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to 
lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that 
Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member 
upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals, to give away as much of our 
own money as we please in charity; but as members of Congress we have no right to 
appropriate a dollar of the public money."</UL>
<P>	After he sat down and a vote was taken, instead of unanimous approval as had 
been assumed, the measure failed with only a few votes in support of it. (Legend has it 
that Crockett, one of the poorest members of the House at that time, was the only one to 
contribute substantially to a private charitable fund for the widow.)</P> 
<P>	
In a famous incident in 1854, President Franklin Pierce was pilloried for vetoing 
an extremely popular bill intended to help the mentally ill. The act was championed by 
the renowned 19th-century social reformer Dorothea Dix. In the face of heavy criticism, 
Pierce countered: "I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for public charity." To 
approve such spending, argued Pierce, "would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of 
the Constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the Union of these States 
is founded."</P> 
<P>	Grover Cleveland, the king of the veto, rejected hundreds of congressional 
spending bills during his two terms as President in the late 1800s, because, as he often 
wrote: "I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution." </P>
<P>	Were Jefferson, Madison, Crockett, Pierce, Cleveland, and the countless other 
lawmakers during that age merely hardhearted and uncaring penny pinchers, as the 
federalists often charged? Did they not have within them sympathy for fire victims? Or 
the mentally ill? Or widows? Or impoverished refugees?</P> 
<P>	The answer is of course they were not uncharitable scrooges. They simply felt 
honorbound to uphold the Constitution. They perceived--we now know correctly--that 
once the genie was out of the bottle, it would be impossible to get it back in. Any 
unwarranted government interference, no matter how righteous or well-intended, would 
be, as Madison put it, "but the first link of a long chain of repetitions." Of course, we now 
know just how remarkably prescient Madison and his colleagues were. </P>
<P>	With notable exceptions, through the first 100 years of the Republic, Congress, 
the President, and the Courts remained mostly faithful to the letter and spirit of the 
Constitution with regard to government spending. As economic historian Robert Higgs 
noted in his famous book <I>Crisis and Leviathan</I>, until the 20th century, "government did 
little of much consequence or expense" other than running the military. The total 
expenditures for the federal budget confirm this assessment. Even as late as 1925, the 
federal government was still spending just 4 percent of national output. </P>
<P>	Several major turning points in American history mark the reversal of this ethic of 
extremely judicious use of the government's powers to spend and tax. The first was the 
passage in 1913 of the 16th Amendment, which permitted a federal income tax. This was 
the first major tax that was not levied on a proportional or uniform basis. Hence, it 
allowed Congress a political free ride: It could provide government benefits to many by 
imposing a disproportionately heavy tax burden on the wealthy. </P>
<P>	Prior to enactment of the income tax, Congress's power to spend was held in 
check by its limited power to tax. Throughout the 19th century, most federal revenues 
came from tariffs and land sales. Neither source yielded huge sums. The income tax, 
however, soon became a cash cow for a Congress needing only the feeblest of excuses to 
spend money.</P> 
<P>	The second major event that weakened constitutional protections against big 
government was the ascendancy of Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda to the 
White House during the Great Depression. During this era, one after another 
constitutional safeguards against excessive government were either wholly ignored or 
spectacularly misinterpreted by the Congress and the courts. Most notable and tragic has 
been the perversion of the "general welfare" clause of the constitution. Article I, Section 
8 of the Constitution says:</P>
<UL>	"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and 
excises to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and promote the general 
welfare of the United States."</UL>
<P>	Since the 1930s, the courts have interpreted this phrase to mean that Congress 
may spend money for any purpose, whether an enumerated power of government or not, 
as long as legislators deem it to be in "the general welfare of the United States." That is, 
this innocent clause has become the equivalent of carte blanche spending authority for 
Congress. </P>
<P>	This was exactly the opposite of what the drafters of the Constitution intended. It 
is almost beyond dispute that the Founders meant the general-welfare clause to be a 
limiting provision on government. They meant that the government's spending and taxing 
powers could only be used for purposes that were in the general welfare of the nation and 
its citizens collectively, not of particular groups of citizens--farmers, students, welfare 
recipients, minorities, the disabled. Jefferson was forever concerned that the general-
welfare clause might be perverted. To clarify its meaning, in 1798 he wrote: "Congress 
has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically 
enumerated." </P>
<P>	In fact, when the early federalists began to argue that the general-welfare clause 
gave Congress a generalized spending authority, they were forcefully rebuked. "Can it be 
conceived that the great and wise men who devised our Constitution," asked South 
Carolina Senator William Drayton in 1828, "should have failed so egregiously as to grant 
a power which rendered restriction upon power practically unavailing?" And then he 
asked the question that is really the essence of the issue: "If Congress can determine what 
constitutes the general welfare and can appropriate money for its advancement, where is 
the limitation to carrying into execution whatever can be effected by money?" </P>
	Exactly.
<P>	By the late 19th century, Congress had adopted the occasional practice of 
enacting spending bills for public charity in the name of "promoting the general welfare." 
These laws often made a mockery of this clause. In 1884, Senator John Morgan of 
Alabama stormed to the Senate floor to describe the impact of a relief bill approved by 
Congress to provide $400,000 of funds for victims of a flood on the Tombigbee River. 
Morgan lamented:</P>
<UL>	"The overflow had passed away before the bill passed Congress, and new crops 
were already growing upon the land. The funds were distributed in the next October and 
November elections upon the highest points of the sand mountains throughout a large 
region where the people wanted what was called `overflow bacon.' I cannot get the 
picture out of my mind. There was the General Welfare of the people invoked and with 
success, to justify this political fraud; the money was voted and the bacon was bought, 
and the politicians went around with their greasy hands distributing it to men who cast 
greasy ballots. And in that way the General Welfare was promoted!"</UL>
<P>	But the real avalanche of such special-interest spending did not start until some 50 
years later in the midst of the Depression. In their urgency to spend public-relief funds to 
combat hard times, legislators began to sound openly contemptuous of the constitutional 
restraints designed to prevent these raids on the public purse. "I have no patience 
whatever with any individual who tries to hide behind the Constitution, when it comes to 
providing foodstuffs for our citizens," argued New York Representative Hamilton Fish in 
support of a 1931 hunger relief bill. "I am going to give the Constitution," said James 
O'Conner, a congressman from Louisiana in that same year, "the flexibility--as will 
enable me to vote for any measure I deem of value to the flesh and blood of my day." </P>
<P>	The tradition of pork-barrel spending began in earnest during this period. In 1931, 
for instance, Congress introduced an act to provide flood relief to farmers in six affected 
states. But by the time the bill made its way through Congress, farmers in 15 states 
became its beneficiaries.</P>
<P>	One Oklahoma congressman succinctly summarized the new beggar-thy-neighbor 
spending ethic that had overtaken Capitol Hill: "I do not believe in this pie business, but 
if we are making a great big pie here--then I want to cut it into enough pieces so that 
Oklahoma will have its piece."</P>
<P>	In 1932, Charles Warren, a former assistant attorney general, wrote a popular 
book entitled <I>Congress as Santa Claus</I>. "If a law to donate aid to any farmer or cattleman 
who has had poor crops or lost his cattle comes within the meaning of the phrase `to 
provide for the General Welfare of the United States,' " he argued, "why should not 
similar gifts be made to grocers, shopkeepers, miners, and other businessmen who have 
made losses through financial depression, or to wage earners out of employment? Why is 
not their prosperity equally within the purview of the General Welfare?" </P>
<P>	Of course, we now know Congress's answer: All of these things are in the 
"general welfare." This is why we now have unemployment compensation, the Small 
Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, food stamps, the black-lung 
program, and on and on. Of course, all of this special interest spending could have 
been--no, should have been--summarily struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. 
But tragically, the Supreme Court eventually served as a willing co-conspirator in these 
spending schemes. </P>
<P>	In a landmark 1936 decision, the Supreme Court inflicted a mortal blow to the 
Constitution by ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was constitutional. The 
court's interpretation of the spending authority of Congress was frightful and fateful. In 
its ruling, the court wrote: "The power of Congress to authorize appropriations of public 
money for public purposes is not limited by the grants of legislative power found in the 
Constitution." </P>
<P>	James M. Beck, the great American legal scholar and former solicitor general, 
likened this astounding assault on the constitution to the Titanic's tragic collision with the 
iceberg. "After the collision," wrote Beck, "which was hardly felt by the steamer at the 
time, the great liner seemed to be intact and unhurt, and continued to move. But a death 
wound had been inflicted under the surface of the water, which poured into the hold of 
the steamer so swiftly that in a few hours the great ship was sunk." </P>
<P>	The New Deal Court essentially told Congress: It doesn't matter what the 
Constitution says or what limits on government it establishes, you are empowered to 
spend money on whatever you please.</P>
<P>   And so Congress does, even to the extent that its profligacy has placed the nation in 
great economic peril. </P>
<P>	Other than the Great Depression, by far the most important events that have 
fostered the growth of government in this century have been the two world wars. Periods 
of national crisis tend to be times where normal constitutional restraints are suspended 
and the nation willingly bands together under government for a national purpose of 
fighting a common enemy.</P>
<P>	Yet the recurring lesson of history is that once government has seized new 
powers, it seldom gives them fully back after the crisis ends. Surely enough, this 
phenomenon is one of Parkinson's famous laws of the public sector:</P>
<UL> 	"Taxes [and spending] become heavier in times of war and should diminish, by 
rights, when the war is over. This is not, however, what happens. Taxes regain their pre-
war level. That is because the level of expenditure rises to meet the wartime level of 
taxation." </UL>
<P>	In the five years prior to World War I, total federal outlays averaged 2 percent of 
GDP. In the five years after the war, they averaged 5 percent of GDP. In the years prior to 
that war the top income tax rate was 7 percent. During the war the tax rate shot up to 70 
percent, which was reduced afterward, but only to 24 percent--or more than three times 
higher than it had originally been. </P>
<P>	Government regulations of the private economy also proliferate during times of 
war and often remain in force afterward. Economist Robert Higgs notes that during 
World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads and the telephone lines, 
requisitioned all ships over 2,500 tons, and regulated food and commodity prices. The 
Lever Act of 1917 gave the government the power to regulate the price and production of 
food, fuels, beverages, and distilled spirits. It is entirely plausible that without the war, 
America would never have suffered through the failed experiment of Prohibition.</P>
<P>	World War II was also the genesis of many modern-day government intrusions--
many of which were and still are of dubious constitutionality. </P>
<P>	These include wage and price controls, conscription (which lasted until the 
1970s), rent control in large cities (which still exists), and, worst of all, federal income-
tax withholding.</P>
<P>	In the post-World War II era, Congress has often relied on a war theme to stretch 
its authority into domestic life. Lyndon Johnson launched the modern welfare state in the 
1960s, when he declared a "war on poverty." In the early 1970s, Richard Nixon imposed 
across-the-board wage and price controls--the ultimate in government command and 
control--as a means of winning the "inflation war." In the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter 
sought to enact a national energy policy with gas rationing and other draconian measures, 
by pleading that the oil crisis had become "the moral equivalent of war." </P>
<P>	While government has clearly been the major beneficiary of national emergency, 
the principal casualty has been liberty. This should give us pause as Congress now sets 
out to solve the health-care crisis, the education crisis, the epidemic of crime, and so 
forth. To Congress, a crisis is an excuse to expand its already near-ubiquitous domain.</P>

<H3>Reinvented Government</H3>
<P>	Shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin was asked how well the Constitution 
would survive the test of time. He responded optimistically that "everything appears to 
promise it will last." Then he added his famous quip, "But in this world nothing is certain 
but death and taxes." </P>
<P>	Ironically, the death wound that has been driven into the Constitution has been 
placed there by precisely those who insist that they want to make it "a living document." 
Yet to argue that we return to the spirit and the true meaning of this "living document" is 
to invite a look of scorn, malice, or outright disbelief from modern-day intellectuals. 
<P>	One is accused of trying to "turn back the clock" when urging that government be 
guided by the original intent of the Constitution. And so few make the case. This, 
ultimately, has left government free to curtail one economic liberty after another. So not 
surprisingly, these liberties have fallen like a row of dominoes. </P>
<P>	It is a strange and sad curiosity that in the entire debate now raging in Washington 
over downsizing government, not a single member of Congress of either party has 
objected to spending on the grounds that "I cannot lay my finger on the article of the 
Constitution which grants a right to Congress to expend money or regulate the economy 
for this purpose." It shows how far we have strayed from constitutional government that 
such a protest is not even bothered with.</P>

<P>	What the Congress needs now is a few Madisons, Jeffersons, Pierces, and 
Crocketts.</P>

	  <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n Father's Day 1986, Richmond Police Detective George Taylor 
stopped Wayne DeLong for a routine traffic violation. DeLong, recently 
released from prison after serving time for murder, shot and killed the 
policeman.</P>
<P>	Leo Webb was a divinity student at Richmond's Virginia Union 
University who liked helping people. One of those he helped was a man 
named James Steele, on parole for a malicious wounding. One day in 1991, 
Steele entered the bakery where Webb worked part time, shot him to death, 
took his money, and went out partying.</P>
<P>	Tragic as such stories are, what makes these two particularly 
disheartening is that both could have been easily prevented. Both killers, 
jailed earlier for violent crimes, spent only a fraction of their sentences in 
prison. We are now paying the dividends of a liberal justice system that 
refuses to take punishment seriously: Virginia has witnessed a 28 percent 
increase in criminal violence over the last five years. Three out of every four 
violent crimes--murder, armed robbery, rape, assault--are now committed by 
repeat offenders.</P>
<P>	This is why my administration pushed through legislation, which took 
effect on January 1, 1995 that will impose penalties for rape, murder, and 
armed robbery more than twice the national average for those crimes. We 
have abolished parole, established the principle of truth-in-sentencing, and 
increased as much as fivefold the amount of time that violent offenders will 
actually spend in jail. Experience vindicates what commonsense has always 
told us: The only foolproof crime-prevention technique is incarceration.</P>
<P>	 Our new system is attempting to unravel 30 years of paper-tiger laws 
based on the questionable philosophy that people can change, criminals can 
be rehabilitated, and every violent criminal--even a murderer--deserves a 
second chance. The new law in Virginia will prevent thousands of crimes, 
save lives, save money, and restore trust in the criminal justice system. 
Despite this, we now face entrenched opposition from liberals in the General 
Assembly, who hope to thwart reform by withholding funds to build the 
minimal number of prison facilities needed to house Virginia's most violent 
inmates.</P> 
<P>	A few weeks after taking office in January 1994, I created the 
Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform. It was a bipartisan 
commission of prosecutors, judges, crime victims, law-enforcement officers, 
business leaders, and legal scholars. William Barr, a former attorney general 
of the United States, and Richard Cullen, a former U.S. Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Virginia, co-chaired the commission. They had a daunting 
task.</P>
<P>	I called for a special session of the General Assembly in September 
1994 to focus the public's and the legislature's attention on this issue. I gave 
the commission six months to demonstrate the need for change, develop a 
detailed plan, and explain its costs and implementation.</P>
<P>	We were quickly able to show why a complete overhaul was necessary. 
Convicted felons were serving about one-third of their sentences on average, 
and many served only one-sixth. Violent criminals were no exception. First-
degree murderers were given average sentences of 35 years, but spent an 
average of only 10 years behind bars. Rapists were being sentenced to nine 
years and serving four. Armed robbers received sentences averaging 14 years 
and served only about four.</P>
<P>	Amazingly, a prior conviction for a violent crime did not affect this 
phenomenon. Even murderers, rapists, and armed robbers who had already 
served time for similar offenses were receiving the same sentences and 
serving the same amount of time as first offenders.</P>
<P>	Statewide, the violent crime rate had risen 28 percent in five years, 
even though the crime-prone age bracket (15 to 24 years) was shrinking. 
Criminologists widely regard trends in the size of this demographic group as 
the best predictor of criminal activity. Unfortunately for Virginians, the 
crime-prone-age population is expected to rise sharply in the state beginning 
in 1996--all the more reason to press forward with reform. The peak age for 
murder and armed robbery has been dropping steadily; by 1993, it stood at 18 
years for both crimes. More than three-quarters of all violent criminals in the 
system in 1993 had prior convictions.</P>
<BR>
<H3>The Plan</H3>
<P>	Only a multi-pronged approach can begin to turn these numbers 
around. Virginia's new law means, first of all, eliminating discretionary 
parole, in which a parole board can release an offender after he has served 
only part of his sentence. In Virginia, this policy clearly was being abused: 
offenders received 30 days of good time for every 30 days they served--
effectively cutting their sentences in half as soon as they came in the door.</P>
<P>	But this is not all. We need to eliminate "good time" as well. In order to 
encourage good behavior among inmates and allow correctional officers to 
maintain order, the commission proposed a system of earned-sentence 
credits. This system would allow inmates to earn a maximum of 54 days per 
year--a dramatic reduction from the average of 300 days they had been given 
in the past.</P>
<P>	Long before our bill became law, we held town meetings across the 
state to solicit advice from citizens, and discussed the plan's details with 
prosecutors, victims-rights groups, corrections experts, and criminologists. 
The need for more prison space became a primary concern. Even before I took 
office, Virginia was expected to double its prison population by the year 2005. 
The state was facing a shortfall of 7,100 prison beds by 1999. At the same 
time, opponents of the plan were already carping about too little spending on 
crime prevention and education and too much on building prisons.</P>
<P>	Obviously, judges need some mechanism to guide their sentencing 
decisions. A system with no parole and no "good time" could not afford 70-
year sentences for drug dealers or 150-year sentences for armed robbers. But 
how much do we increase the time served for violent offenders? Our 
commission found an answer by evaluating the relationship of recidivism to 
time served and age of release. The data showed that the longer an offender 
remained behind bars, the less likely he is to commit another crime after 
finishing his sentence. Similarly, the older the offender upon release, the less 
his propensity to commit more crime. In fact, after 37 years of age, the 
likelihood of violent crime drops dramatically.</P>
<P>   Although preventing criminals from committing further acts of violence was 
the primary goal, the increases had to reflect the notion of retribution as well. 
We wanted Virginia to send a message to violent criminals: We will not 
tolerate violence, and if you commit a violent crime, you will stay in prison 
until you're too old to commit another one.</P>
<P>	Virginia increased prison time for violent criminals as follows:
<UL>
<LI>  100 percent increase for first-time violent offenders.
<LI>  125 percent for first-time murderers, rapists, and armed robbers.
<LI>  300 percent for those with previous convictions for assault, burglary, or 
malicious wounding.
 <LI> 500 percent for those with previous convictions for murder, rape, or armed 
robbery.</UL>
<P>	To target the young violent offender, we counted comparable juvenile 
offenses as felony convictions when determining a sentence. For example, if 
John Smith is found guilty in a juvenile court of armed robbery at age 14, and 
was convicted of another armed robbery at age 19, the sentencing guidelines 
call for a 500 percent increase in the time he normally would have served 
under the old system.</P>
<P>	By abolishing a bankrupt parole system, and by drastically reforming 
the "good time" credit provisions, Virginia courtrooms are redefining what the 
truth-in-sentencing debate is really about. Under our system, every inmate 
convicted of a violent crime will serve a minimum of 85 percent of his or her 
sentence. Nationwide, criminals on average serve well below 50 percent of 
their sentences. There is simply no surer way for the state to protect its 
citizens from society's most dangerous members.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Saving Lives and Money</H3>
<P>	 Had the law been in effect nine years ago, it would have saved the life 
of Detective Taylor. Had it been in effect four years ago, Leo Webb would be 
alive today.</P>
<P>	The most conservative estimates show that more than 4,300 felony 
crimes would have been prevented between 1986 and 1993 if the current 
system had been in place. That number is based on actual convictions--real 
cases, not projections.</P>
<P>	Over the next 10 years, the new law will prevent at least 119,000 
felonies, including 26,000 violent crimes. Because of those averted violent 
crimes, an estimated 475 lives will be saved, 3,700 women will be spared from 
rape, and more than 11,300 aggravated assaults will not be committed. As a 
result, citizens will save more than $2.7 billion in direct costs.</P>
<P>	Back in September, when it became clear that the legislation would 
pass with overwhelming support, some vocal opponents claimed that 
abolishing parole was a declaration of war on young black males. They 
demanded that the Commonwealth spend more money on prevention 
programs, and charged that, by focusing on punishment, we were merely 
catering to "white fear." Their arguments fell on deaf ears.</P>
<P>	The crime prevented as a result of the new law will benefit the African-
American community--one-fifth of Virginia's population--more than any 
other group. Of the preventable murders that occurred between 1986 and 
1993, about 65 percent involved black victims. For assaults during that same 
period, about 60 percent of the victims were black. Taylor and Webb were 
both African Americans.</P>
<P>	Of all the crimes committed by recidivists during that same period, 60 
percent would have been prevented if the current law had been in place. 
There is no other prevention program that can show even a fraction of this 
success. That is not to say that other prevention programs are not valid or 
important. However, it is clear that when it comes to violent offenders, 
incarceration is the most just and the most efficient.</P>
<P>	Virginia has been spending an average of $658 million in taxpayers' 
money each year on handling recidivists. This is the cost of new 
investigations, new arrests, and new trials. The total cost of the prison 
construction needs for the next 10 years is about $750 million. The new law 
will force us to build more prisons--but not many more. Virginia would have 
doubled its prison population in the next 10 years anyway.</P>
<P>	The difference is that under the old system, the ratio of violent 
criminals among the prison population to non-violent has been 50:50. 
Marijuana dealers, embezzlers, and petty thieves have been serving time in 
the same $40,000-per-year hard cells as murderers, rapists, and armed 
robbers. Under the new guidelines, the inmate ratio will be 70 percent 
violent, 30 percent non-violent. This is obviously a more cost-effective use of 
medium- and maximum-security prison space.</P>
<P>	Try telling that, however, to the liberals in the General Assembly. I 
asked lawmakers in February for $402.6 million as a first installment in 
revamping our prison system. They voted to provide only $104.4 million. They 
are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous 
criminals will be released early--and be back in our neighborhoods. 
Increasing prison terms without increasing prison capacity is precisely the 
mistake that too many other states have already made.</P>
<P>	Part of the problem with the current system of incarceration is its near 
inability to distinguish between dangerous criminals and the more routine, 
petty offenders. Under our plan, we are building low-cost work centers to 
house first-time and non-violent offenders. These work centers operate at 
about half the cost per inmate as a standard prison, and they ensure that the 
inmates get work opportunities while incarcerated. The average length of 
stay at a work center will be about 10 to 18 months. We can build these 
facilities quickly, freeing up bed space in the prisons for violent criminals.</P>
<P>	The abolition of parole and establishment of truth-in-sentencing rules 
was the centerpiece of my campaign for governor in 1993. During that 
campaign, critics claimed my approach was too drastic and too costly. Pundits 
and politicians still doubt that Virginia can overhaul its entire criminal-
justice system without breaking the bank. Those naysayers failed to hear the 
public's demand for change. The people of Virginia--particularly crime 
victims and their families--are tired of seeing criminals walk free after 
serving only a fraction of their sentences. Businessmen can't afford to watch 
deals collapse because potential clients are concerned about crime. 
Prosecutors and police are frustrated that their hard work often amounts to 
abbreviated prison stints for criminals.</P>
<P>	In order to overturn the status quo approach to crime reduction, we 
listened to all those people and presented extensive research to show that 
what we had been doing was not working. Public safety is the primary 
responsibility of government. Without it, nothing else can succeed. Education, 
economic development, and health care all suffer when people feel 
threatened.</P>
<P>	Virginians came together to formulate and implement this reform. We 
looked at what North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and the federal government 
had done in the area of sentencing reform. We borrowed some of the best 
aspects of those systems and avoided some of the mistakes they made. In the 
end, we did it the Virginia way.</P>
<P>	The principle that guided this effort, and should guide policymakers in 
all issues, is honesty. Easy-release rules prevent judges and juries from 
preempting the community's judgment about the proper punishment for 
illegal conduct. Under the new law, judges will not have to play guessing 
games when imposing sentences. Police officers will not have to see the same 
criminals out on the streets only a year after their last arrest. Criminals will 
know that they cannot beat the system. Crime victims and their families will 
finally see justice done. Virginia's citizens can now trust that their 
government is working to make this Commonwealth a safe place to live, to 
work, and to raise families.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT></B>rop subsidies for the 400-acre farm that we rent here in northwest Missouri 
average $10,000 a year, and I've gotten in the habit of spending it all. But Pat Roberts, 
congressman from Dodge City, Kansas, and the new chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee, assures me that I won't have to wear bib overalls with a scarlet "S" for 
"subsidy" on the front. Well, that's a relief.</P>
<P>	Roberts's sense of humor is as dry as the West Kansas wind. And this year he'll 
need it, because 1995 will see the reauthorization of the Farm Bill, the huge piece of 
legislation that will govern federal agricultural programs for the next five years. As a 
defender of the existing subsidies, Roberts may find himself as lonely as a Dodge City 
vegetarian.</P>
<P>	Several rounds of budget-cutting have pared farm programs by half, or $14 billion 
annually, since 1989. Roberts intends to protect what is left, and that may take more than 
a good sense of humor. He will have few allies. The Clinton administration has no 
interest in agriculture, except for a desire to turn the Midwest into a gigantic wetland, and 
to do whatever the poultry industry wants. Bob Dole, normally a roadblock in the way of 
farm reform, will be busy running the Senate and his presidential campaign. The new 
leadership of the House of Representatives includes Dick Armey, who looks at farm 
subsidies the way a dog looks at a bone. Richard Lugar, the chairman of the Senate 
Agriculture Committee, has opened the debate with a list of 53 questions about farm 
policy. His first one: "Should we have a farm program at all?" (Roberts likens Lugar to 
Lizzie Borden, taking 53 whacks at farmers.) Farm programs have been on the defensive 
for years, but Lugar is the first leading farm-state legislator to question their very 
existence. Roberts is circling the wagons to do what agriculture-committee chairmen have 
always done--protect the subsidies--but this time he may lose.</P>
<P>	Although I have long been a critic of farm subsidies in principle, Lugar's 
questions and the programs' unpopularity have suddenly turned a philosophical question 
into a frighteningly personal one. In addition to his 53 questions, the 54th and most 
important one is: How would I replace the $10,000 in subsidies that I receive each year?</P>
<P>	Well, for one thing, I'd grow more beans. My corn crop is directly subsidized, but 
my soybean crop isn't. So guess which crop I grow more of. Without corn subsidies, 
growing soybeans would be more profitable for us here in Westboro, and in many years 
beans are more profitable even after we receive our green government checks. But we 
consistently plant more than half our acres in corn to protect our corn base. Base is the 
number of acres planted to a subsidized crop, and is used to determine the size of 
government payments.</P>
<P>	If we plant more soybeans to take advantage of their greater profitability, we lose 
some eligibility for future corn subsidies. Fathers pass many important lessons along to 
their sons. Here in the Corn Belt, a 60-year-old lesson is: Protect your base!</P>
<P>	We could offset some of these lost subsidies by reducing our costs of production. 
Soybeans are cheaper to plant, and their yield is less dependent on timely rains. We could 
save on the expensive insecticides we have to apply to the 20 percent of our land that is in 
continuous corn.</P>
<P>	We could also save on commercial fertilizer. Soybeans "fix," or capture, nitrogen 
from the air and leave it in the soil. Some of that nitrogen is available as nutrient for the 
following year's crop. By increasing our soybean acreage, we could do with less 
fertilizer. (The two crops compete for the same acres in this region; if soybean prices 
dropped because lots of other farmers made the same decision, then corn would become 
more profitable.)</P>
<P>	Another thing we'd do without farm subsidies is grow more. In order to qualify 
for government payments, we must leave part of our farm idle. This spring, for instance, 
we will plant on only 380 of our 400 acres. We could plant those other 20 acres without 
any additional investment in tractors, or combines, or rent. Without the acreage 
limitations imposed by farm programs, we would spread our fixed costs over more acres.</P>
<P>	And perhaps most important of all, there is gumbo. Gumbo is the soil that makes 
up much of our river-bottom ground. The spring after we plant corn on gumbo, the soil 
has the consistency of well-cured concrete. There are only two solutions to this problem: 
fall plowing, which is terribly expensive, or rotation to soybeans.</P>
<P>	Without the program, we could increase our average yields through better crop 
rotation. Corn after soybeans consistently yields 10 to 20 percent more than second-year 
corn. So part of the lost subsidies would be replaced by higher yields.</P>
<P>	The largest single expense for any farmer is the cost of his land. And this is where 
the farm program has its biggest impact. The first thing farmers want to know when a 
neighbor's farm comes up for sale is the size of its crop base. Farms with a large corn 
base are eligible for higher subsidies, and so are worth more than those with a smaller 
one--another reason to protect the base. When farm subsidies diminish, the price of land 
falls. Farmers compete with one another for land.  Farm policy has the effect of 
subsidizing established farmers who own much of their land, and making it more difficult 
for younger farmers to buy or rent land to establish themselves. Farm programs are often 
touted as an attempt to save the family farm. But when the capitalized value of subsidies 
raises the costs to families who want to farm, the programs serve as a barrier to entry. Not 
surprisingly, the average age of farmers is well over 50. Cuts in farm subsidies would 
allow easier entry into farming, and less expensive transfer of farms between generations.</P>
<P>	Without subsidies, we would be freed of a number of bureaucratic burdens. This 
spring, we will have to trek to the local Consolidated Farm Services Administration office 
to receive approval for our crop plan. After all of our crops are planted, we must return to 
certify that we did what we said we would. Government planes fly over our farm to take 
photographs and make sure that our corn plantings are within the limits. (Since we 
farmers don't have antiaircraft batteries, the USDA needn't resort to spy satellites.) We 
also have to file conservation plans and plan our crop rotations years in advance.</P>
<P>	How much of the $10,000 that I've become so attached to would be replaced if I 
could farm without all these constraints? I don't know. If full-scale production led to 
huge surpluses, and crop prices fell to extremely low levels and stayed there, then I would 
suffer a great deal. But without the guarantee of protection from Uncle Sam, surpluses 
might not be as much of a problem as in the past. Loan rates (the floor under the market 
price) were set above the cost of production in the 1980 farm bill, and huge surpluses 
were the result.</P> 
<P>	But sometimes we learn from our mistakes: Since 1990, loan rates have been 
below market-clearing levels. Record harvests in 1992 and 1994 have not produced a 
huge carry-over of grain. In fact, prices are slightly higher now than after the 1992 
harvest, even though corn production in 1994 was considerably higher. And in years of 
short supply, my profits might well rise without farm programs, because the government 
sells its grain stocks to set a ceiling on prices.</P>
<P>	Senator Lugar wants to know why some crops are subsidized and others are not. 
He also wants to know whether unsubsidized crops are consistently less profitable than 
subsidized ones. As I've pointed out, we can make as much profit on soybeans, which are 
not directly subsidized, as on corn. The greenhouses where we grow unsubsidized 
geraniums are the most profitable enterprise on my farm, and I don't have to wait for a 
government check. Cattle and hogs have no subsidy programs, yet hogs are consistently 
among the most profitable of agricultural commodities. Florida oranges receive no 
government support, while California oranges are grown under government rules that 
constrain supply and raise prices. Are Florida growers selling out and heading for 
California? I hardly think so.</P>
<P>	Any government subsidy increases costs in the subsidized industry, and any 
government-provided profits tend to be bid into the factors of production. There is little 
evidence that subsidies boost profits in the long run, and the fact that some crops are 
subsidized and others are not is an accident of history and politics.</P>
<P>	In the last two years, farmers witnessed two events that will make more difference 
in the long run than any farm bill could: the passage of GATT and of NAFTA. These 
trade agreements will raise agricultural exports and prices by large amounts. GATT will 
require the European Union to cut subsidies by 36 percent. Export subsidies for more 
than 8 million tonnes of European exports will have to be cut. American farmers are the 
low-cost producers of most of the commodities that Europe subsidizes, and we stand to 
gain most of that business.</P>
<P>	GATT is expected to raise incomes worldwide by as much as $5 trillion in the 
next 10 years. Many of those dollars will be spent to improve diets, as consumers 
worldwide boost their consumption of meat. Since the passage of NAFTA, agricultural 
exports to Mexico have risen by 22 percent, or $670 million, in the first 10 months of 
1994.</P>

<H3>New Farmers' Market</H3>
<P>	That giant sucking sound you hear emanates mainly from Midwestern grain bins, 
busily shipping corn and soybeans south of the border. When Mexico recovers from its 
peso crisis, NAFTA is expected to boost U.S. agricultural exports annually by $2.6 
billion.</P>
<P>	As trade barriers around the world fall, the number of people who can afford to 
buy what I produce is increasing. China has a middle class 100 million strong. With 22 
percent of the world's population, and an economy growing at 10 percent per year, 
China's potential as a market for food is mindboggling. As NAFTA expands to include 
Central and South America, more new markets will open. When the decline in trade 
barriers is combined with growth in worldwide incomes, U.S. farmers may well be 
entering a golden age for agriculture. And here on my farm in Westboro, I may find that 
being part of a freer world market pays better than farming for Uncle Sam.</P>
<P>	I've thought a lot about Senator Lugar's questions. I've tried to figure out how it 
would affect me financially if the answers to those questions persuade Congress to end or 
drastically reduce farm programs. And I think the answer is clear. I can survive without 
subsidies. In some years, I might even be better off. And there is one more question that 
Lugar asked that goes to the crux of the matter: "What is the rationale for transferring 
public funds from taxpayers, most of whom have moderate incomes, to all farmers, 
including those whose incomes--are substantially above--average?" Well, I don't 
know how you justify that.</P>
<P>	Recently, my brother took his 15-year-old son along with him to the local USDA 
office. One of the employees behind the counter pointed out that my nephew was the 
fourth generation of our family that she had worked with. I'm a little uncomfortable with 
being on the dole for that length of time, and I'm particularly uncomfortable knowing that 
my income and assets would qualify me as solidly middle class. The lady behind the 
counter retired shortly afterwards. I don't imagine it was the thought of another 
generation of Hursts that drove her into retirement, but I do believe that maybe four 
generations of middle-class welfare is enough.</P>
<P>	As Congress scrutinizes farm programs, it needs to keep one thing in mind. Pat 
Roberts tells the story of one of his constituents, who said, "I don't care what you do to 
me, as long as you let me know."</P>
<P>	Farmers have planned their businesses with the expectation of continued farm 
payments. Any reform of agricultural policy must keep those expectations in mind. We 
have been adjusting to lower subsidies for five years, and have made those adjustments 
fairly easily. Perhaps we should allow another five years to wind down this 60-year-old 
experiment in central planning, retire our overalls with the red "S," and let farmers do 
what we do best: produce the cheapest and most plentiful food supply the world has ever 
known.</P>

<p>        	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT></B>othing could be more heart-breaking than the sight of a baby born with an 
addiction to cocaine. There is very little doctors and nurses can do to ease the pain of 
these innocent newborns, whose mothers' use of hard, illegal drugs during pregnancy 
constitutes nothing less than blatant child abuse.</P>
<P>	Walk into the neonatal unit of any hospital in America, and you will see crack-
cocaine babies. Some cry and shake uncontrollably. They refuse to take food. Many die.</P> 
<P>	And those who survive are far more likely than other children to be sentenced to 
lives of behavioral problems, birth defects, and learning disabilities.</P>
<P>	Nationwide, one in 10 children born has been exposed to cocaine in the womb. 
This condition affects 350,000 babies a year. Our society can address this problem 
effectively. We can significantly reduce this type of child abuse. Unfotunately, the policy 
of the Clinton administration is to protect, not the children, but the "rights" of the mothers 
to escape the consequences of their actions.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, when I was serving as a circuit solicitor in South Carolina, I 
became aware of the growing problem of crack-cocaine babies at Charleston's Medical 
Unversity of South Carolina (MUSC). My office worked with the hospital to aggressively 
confront pregnant women with the consequences of their drug use. Over a five-year 
period, we presented all pregnant mothers who tested positive for cocaine use with a 
choice: Either seek drug treatment or face arrest and jail time.</P>
<P>	This became one of the first "crack-baby" prevention programs in the nation. And 
the program worked. Scores of women agreed to enter rehabilitation and stayed off drugs 
for the remainder of their pregnancies. Before-and-after statistics present a clear picture. 
Before the sanctions took effect, 24 pregnant mothers a month tested positive for cocaine. 
Virtually none of them was willing to seek help voluntarily. Then, beginning in 1989, 
when we launched a tough amnesty program, the number testing positive for cocaine 
dropped to five or six a month. Prenatal visits as well as live births at the hospital stayed 
the same. Other states were looking at our success as a model.</P>
<P>	Tragically, the cocaine-baby program, which was clearly saving lives, was 
effectively shut down by the Clinton administration. Under the president's direction, a 
swarm of federal officials came to Charleston making unfounded allegations of 
discrimination and accusing the hospital of violating the "privacy rights" of the addicted 
mothers. The Clinton administration warned us that a private civil-rights suit was 
pending, and threatened to cut off $54 million in federal assistance, or about 60 percent 
of the facility's annual budget. Last year, the hospital finally relented, ending the 
successful intervention program.</P>
<P>    Now, once again, the babies cry out in agony. And once again, hospital staff with no 
legal recourse must watch pregnant women knowingly cause neurological damage to 
their unborn children. MUSC nurse Shirley Brown expressed the frustration eloquently: 
"You just have to sit around with your hands tied and watch them destroy a baby." 
Indeed she is right. If this is what President Clinton has in mind when he calls for a return 
to individual and community responsibility, then this administration faces a profound 
moral crisis.</P>
<P>	Administration officials and representatives of the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) called the cocaine-baby program punitive, discriminatory, and invasive. 
In fact, it was none of the above.</P>
<P>	By the late 1980s, nurse Brown and her staff noticed an increasing number of 
pregnant women coming to the hospital--not for prenatal care, but because of 
hemorrhaging or other acute problems related to their pregnancies. In the course of 
treatment, many of these women tested positive for drug use, usually cocaine. Thus the 
program grew out of a deep concern among the hospital staff for the welfare of both 
mother and child.</P>
<P>	At first, the hospital tried to educate the women about the damage they were 
causing to themselves and to their unborn babies. Sadly, hospital workers could not 
convince many of the expectant drug-addicted women to enter a drug-treatment program. 
Most wouldn't even return for any type of prenatal care at all. The women--mostly poor 
and uneducated--received free counseling. They were offered free drug treatment and 
free prenatal care, but few participated in the program voluntarily.</P>
<P>	At the same time, the delivery and treatment of crack babies was putting a 
tremendous strain on hospital resources, as well as on the moral sensibilities of hospital 
personnel. Normal neonatal delivery costs can be as low as $500 per baby, but the costs 
of cocaine babies and the intense postnatal care they require have increased 
tremendously. The hospital has seen bills reach $750,000.  Most are born to welfare 
mothers, so Medicaid and the hospital were picking up the bill. According to the General 
Accounting Office, a single cocaine baby can run up a lifetime tab of $1 million in 
medical and educational costs.</P>
<P>	At the time we launched the cocaine baby program in Charleston, I was circuit 
solicitor. Last year, I was elected attorney general for South Carolina, and now view the 
problem from a statewide perspective. Hospitals across our state see drug-damaged 
babies with growing frequency. In every major city in the country, hospitals have units 
devoted to crack mothers and crack babies. But no one dares to forcefully address the 
causes of the problem. We are merely watching it happen and paying an increasingly high 
price in dollars and human suffering. We saw an opportunity to make a difference.</P>
<P>	During the operation of the cocaine-baby program in Charleston, everyone 
concerned was brought to the table--social workers, people from Charleston County 
Substance Abuse, drug-rehabilitation specialists, law-enforcement officials, hospital 
officials, and my office, which was willing to prosecute when necessary. We all agreed 
on one principle: We needed a program that used not only a carrot, but a real and very 
firm stick.</P>
<P>	Those who argued most forcefully for the cocaine-baby program were people who 
dealt with drug addiction every day: the rehabilitation specialists. They told us that 
"unless you have sanctions in place, unless you understand the basic irresponsibility of 
these drug-addicted women, it won't work."</P> 
<P>	Working closely with Chief Reuben Greenberg of the Charleston Police 
Department, we set up an amnesty program with sanctions for those who don't abide by 
the rules. Whenever a prenatal patient tested positive for drugs, hospital staff first 
counseled the mother about what she was doing to her unborn baby. They presented her 
with a letter from the solicitor's office explaining that she faced arrest and prosecution 
(crack cocaine use is a felony in South Carolina) if she refused treatment. The solicitor's 
office then promised to drop all charges if the woman successfully completed a drug-
treatment program. We saw this as a child-abuse prevention program with a goal of 
producing a healthy child.</P>
<P>	We had solid legal grounds to act in this manner, especially in the third trimester 
of the pregnancy. During the final trimester, the fetus is regarded as viable, that is, 
capable of sustaining life on its own, and is therefore granted significant protections 
under both federal and state law. Indeed, the viable fetus is a person under the law. In this 
legal context, we offered pregnant women immunity from prosecution, free medical 
services, and free access to a program of drug rehabilitation. All we asked of them in 
return was to enter the program in good faith and to stop abusing their unborn children 
with illegal drugs.</P>
<P>	Politically correct resolutions by the American Medical Association and the 
American Pediatrics Association denounced the policy as punitive and unwise. The 
National Institutes of Health also sent down some officials, who made the incredible 
claim that the hospital was conducting coercive experiments on pregnant women. Then 
the Clinton administration, ideologically driven by the absurd notion that a woman's 
privacy rights overrule a mother's most basic responsibility to her own child, would not 
allow us to protect the lives of the babies or their self-destructive mothers. Donna 
Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, sent an investigative team from the 
department's ethics division. One HHS official, without offering any evidence, claimed 
the program had "a chilling effect on minority pregnant women seeking prenatal health 
care."</P>
<P>	Of course, the cocaine-baby program was not punitive. The program was not 
designed to put people in jail. It was a humanitarian effort to save lives through tough, 
decisive action under urgent circumstances. In fact, the women involved in the program 
almost invariably avoided jail.</P>
<P>	Most of the pregnant women who tested positive for crack cocaine (after they 
understood their options) agreed to enter the drug program. The small number who 
refused the program were indeed arrested, but nearly all of their cases were dismissed 
because the women quickly agreed to enter the program once they saw we were serious. 
Only two continued to refuse help, and they were ultimately placed on probation. The 
cocaine-baby program was not a punitive "lock-up" program, but an amnesty program. 
And it was working.</P>
<P>	Also, there is absolutely no evidence that it scared anyone away from prenatal 
care. Remember, very few of these women came to the hospital in the first place to take 
advantage of prenatal services. They came because of urgent medical problems related 
either to their pregnancy or to their addiction.</P>
<P>	Opponents of our cocaine-baby program continually failed to understand that 
prosecutorial action, like a thermostat, can be constantly adjusted. Charges can be 
dropped at any time. We can add conditions.</P> 
<P>	The system has a great deal of flexibility that can be used to motivate 
irresponsible people to take responsible action. Many public defenders (though they are 
not likely to admit it publicly) thought the cocaine-baby program was a great idea.</P>
<P>	Cocaine addicts need a strong motive to mend their ways. And most drug and 
law-enforcement officials also agree. A federally funded research survey showed that 
about 30 percent of those who enter public drug-treatment programs do so only because 
of direct or indirect legal pressure. The Office of National Drug Control Policy noted in a 
1992 report that "the criminal justice system can steer offenders toward drug treatment as 
a condition for deferred prosecution."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration, however, seemed utterly unconcerned with common 
sense or practical solutions to a problem that is literally destroying the lives of adults and 
infants. Within a matter of weeks, HHS also sent investigators from its Office of Civil 
Rights. They alleged that the program was discriminatory toward blacks. Marie Chretien, 
a regional manager in the Office of Civil Rights, claimed in a letter to the hospital that its 
substance-abuse policy "may result in an adverse disproportionate impact on African-
American women."</P>
<P>	It is true that most of the women treated were black. The hospital serves a 
primarily indigent population, and most of the patient population is black. The South 
Carolina Drug Prevalence Study showed blacks were more likely to use cocaine than 
whites.</P>
<P>	Ask Police Chief Greenberg, who is also African American, if this policy was 
discriminatory. He would be among the first to tell you that cocaine use is much more 
common in South Carolina among blacks than whites--and that the black community 
was benefiting most from the prenatal program. "[The program's opponents] don't care 
about the race issue. They're just using this as a tactic," Greenberg says. "I was glad that 
somebody was finally doing something to help kids in the black community. It was 
giving kids a chance who otherwise would not have anything close to an equal playing 
field. At least at the point of birth, that child ought to be given the best opportunity for a 
full and productive life."</P>
<P>	In spite of all this, the HHS civil-rights office threatened in a letter last June to cut 
off federal money to MUSC unless it backed away from its aggressive treatment program. 
"It is the government's obligation to ensure that federal funds do not support a program 
which discriminates," Chretien wrote in the letter. "This obligation entails making a 
formal determination of whether there is a violation of the Title VI regulation--and if 
negotiations for voluntary compliance fail, the initiation of administrative enforcement 
proceedings to terminate federal financial assistance."</P>
<P>	What continues to amaze me, as the state's chief law-enforcement officer, is the 
groundlessness of the discrimination charge. In October 1993, the liberal, feminist Center 
for Reproductive Law and Policy filed a civil suit against the hospital alleging that its 
policy was racially discriminatory, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of 
the 14th Amendment. The New York-based center, an offshoot of the ACLU, asked a 
federal judge to issue an injunction against the hospital to suspend the drug-testing 
program. The judge declined, finding no basis for the discrimination charge.</P>
<P>	It's no coincidence, by the way, that shortly after the feminist group failed in its 
lawsuit, investigators from the Clinton administration swooped down on the Medical 
University. I am convinced their plan was coordinated with HHS officials. So is the 
hospital. "It was obvious to us there was collusion between the center and all the federal 
agencies that came down on us," says the university's president, Dr. James Edwards.</P>
<P>	Whether HHS officials would have followed with their own lawsuit is unclear. 
Almost certainly they could not have won in court. But they didn't need to. The hospital, 
dependent on federal funding, never had a chance. HHS agents made an ex parte decision 
that the program was discriminatory. And so they exercised the federal version of the 
golden rule--that is, they've got the gold, so they make the rules.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration was willing to withhold millions of dollars from the 
Medical University, stop all of its Medicaid assistance, shut down its children's hospital 
and its cancer center, discontinue dozens of medical services from radiation oncology to 
pediatric surgery, close down its 558 beds, and force the hospital to turn away its 
patients--all to end a program that offended the liberal sensibilities of Donna Shalala and 
Bill Clinton. A gun was held to the hospital's head, and for the protection of all the other 
patients, the hospital had to agree to give up.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, this saga isn't over yet. The Office of the Solicitor and virtually 
everyone else involved in the hospital's prenatal drug policy is being sued by the Center 
for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of five women who tested positive for cocaine.</P> 
<P>	They want $3 million. It's a complicated suit, but it boils down to a claim that the 
program violated their right to privacy. In fact, the so-called constitutional right to 
privacy does not protect the results of a drug screen, especially not in this case.</P>
<P>	First of all, you don't have a right to use crack cocaine; it's a felony. Second, all 
of the women knew about the amnesty program--there were public-service 
announcements about it, the women voluntarily came to the only hospital in the state that 
sponsored it, they were counseled about the consequences of testing positive, and they all 
signed consent forms before being screened.</P>
<P>	Medical personnel are held legally accountable for the health of both mother and 
unborn child throughout the pregnancy. In fact, malpractice insurance exists to support 
the obligations of primary-care providers in just such cases. If a fetus is damaged by 
inadequate, mistaken, or negligent medical practice, the hospital would quickly face 
lawsuits. So how is it that we have no legal means to keep mothers from seriously 
damaging or destroying their own babies? "If the mother is not going to be held 
responsible," says nurse Brown, "then I don't think any nurse or physician giving 
obstetrical care should have to be held liable."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration apparently believes that infants have no rights at all 
until the umbilical cord is cut. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never said that the states 
do not have a compelling interest in protecting the health of the unborn in the third 
trimester when they can live outside the womb. Indeed, case law in South Carolina and 
elsewhere suggests that society does have certain obligations to the unborn child, 
certainly at very advanced stages of development. South Carolina courts have interpreted 
"person" to include a viable fetus.</P>
<P>	We put tremendous resources into prosecuting child-abuse cases because of the 
great damage done to children, and we make no apologies for that. The cocaine-baby 
program we started in South Carolina was, most of all, a child-abuse prevention program, 
protecting the smallest and the most innocent of children.</P>
<P>	President Clinton and his messengers appear to be fundamentally unconcerned 
with the hundred of thousands of cocaine-addicted women who stagger into the delivery 
units of hospitals across the land. The only remedy they offer to the horribly damaged 
children who result from this madness is to increase the flow of Medicaid dollars, 
provided by taxpayers, to pay a price so large that it is literally impossible to calculate. 
And the greatest frustration of all is knowing that this increasingly expensive tragedy can 
be prevented. One of the most basic responsibilities a mother has is to her child. If a 
mother injected cocaine into the tiny arm of her infant, causing permanent brain damage 
or death, certainly that mother would be arrested and prosecuted.</P>
<P>	Yet that is exactly what addicted mothers do when they consume cocaine 
throughout their pregnancy. In South Carolina, we tried to do something about it. The 
program we created was working. Now it is no more. And as long as powerful federal 
bureaucrats continue to manipulate federal funding to serve a bizarre agenda that is deaf 
to the cries of damaged babies, there is nothing more we can do.</P>
<P>	Why is the Clinton administration stopping us from protecting our children?</P>

<p>
	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>hen Bell Atlantic Chairman Ray Smith offered to help Congress find alternative 
sources of money to replace federal funding of public-television broadcasting, PBS 
supporters protested en masse. And when Jones Intercable--which already distributes 
adult-education courses through its Mind Extension University--offered to take over 
programming for PBS, the cries of outrage grew louder. Public broadcasting, which has 
always presented itself as an impoverished charity case throughout years of on-air beg-a-
thons, was suddenly described by PBS president Ervin Duggan as a valuable business 
enterprise that should not be "sold off for scrap."</P>
<P>	A similar contradiction surfaced when House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) first 
announced on National Empowerment Television (which receives no tax money) that 
he'd like to "zero out" federal subsidies for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
Lobbyists attacked him for wanting to "kill" public broadcasting. This same lobby 
counters criticism of its reliance on tax money by pointing out that the federal share of its 
revenue was only 14 percent of the total.</P>
<P>	The conflicting arguments of public-television advocates against the privatization 
of the industry illuminate the broad contours of the debate: Congress is now debating 
proposed cuts in appropriations for public broadcasting of 15 percent for 1996 and 30 
percent for 1997. But the issue is about more than just $285.6 million in tax money; it is 
also about the role and reach of the federal government and an elitist culture determined 
to manipulate it for its own purposes:</P>

<H3>Plenty of Money</H3>
<P>	Public broadcasters maintain that the federal share of their income is sacrosanct, 
the "seed money," and quite unlike the remaining 86 percent that comes from other 
sources. But, in fact, the federal matching formulas work precisely in the opposite 
manner. It is the non-federal money which is the "seed money" for public broadcasting, 
as anyone who has ever watched a pledge-week special will recognize. The federal 
government offers to match the amount of private funds each station succeeds in raising. 
This is the reason large urban stations with wealthy viewerships perversely receive more 
money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting than do small, rural stations. It all 
prompts the question: Why are CPB advocates so certain the rest of their income could 
not be generated outside of federal coffers?</P>
<P>	It was a curious thing to watch this hostility to businessmen displayed by 
representatives of an institution that usually, at least in public, sings honeyed praises of 
"public-private partnership." These same elites point to the many <I>Fortune 500</I> 
corporations that enjoy enhanced prestige through their association with PBS: General 
Motors, Mobil, Exxon, GTE, New York Life, and Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	Indeed, private-sector benefactors who offered to raise money for the educational 
broadcasting system were described by Frank Rich, a columnist for the <I>New York Times</I>, 
not as generous philanthropists, but rather as "circling vultures." The privatization that 
had once been described as impossible is now denounced as being all too likely.</P>
<P>	The availability of private funding sources reveals that the fundamental issues are 
ideological and not financial. Proponents of federal support for public broadcasting want 
the government to be involved because they dislike private enterprise. They claim to fear 
the "trash" that a market-based broadcasting system could produce. They say they want 
to make television "safe for kids."</P>
<P>	What they dislike, however, is not poor-quality programming, but the very idea of 
the market. If it were the former, then how can PBS justify <I>Tales of the City</I>, a campy 
soap opera; <I>Tongues Untied</I>, which was both crude and lewd; Frontline's <I>Death of a 
Playboy Centerfold</I> and <I>Death of a Porn Queen</I>, subjects more suitable to tabloid 
television; and <I>Yanni: Live at the Acropolis</I>, which some might consider of doubtful 
value? Clearly such programming is not intrinsically superior to <I>A Current Affair</I> or 
<I>Inside Edition</I>. In fact, trash is not in the least offensive to the fans of public 
broadcasting--commercial trash is.</P>
<P>	In the PBS world view, exposure on public television can even elevate 
commercial television into art. Take the case of <I>I'll Fly Away</I>. A CBS drama starring Sam 
Waterston and Alfre Woodard, it did well critically, but poorly in the ratings, and was 
canceled after one season. PBS picked it up, producing one new episode and then airing a 
full season of repeats. The series depicted the effect on one family of the civil rights 
movement in the South, and flattered the sensibility of the liberal professionals who make 
up the core PBS audience. No doubt they could identify with this well-educated Southern 
family, which was manifestly superior to the backwards rednecks who made up the rest 
of the white folks in the series.</P>
<P>	The program was among the highest-rated shows ever broadcast by the network. 
If anything, the success of <I>I'll Fly Away</I> has indicated that a show by commercial 
producers was just what public broadcasting needed. But that was not what happened. 
Despite the series's appeal, no further commercial drama has appeared on the network. 
Indeed, PBS even canceled a development deal with producer Brandon Tartikoff, who 
had been president of NBC when it was at the top of the ratings.</P>
<P>	Commercial-drama producers were not welcome at PBS even after the success of 
<I>I'll Fly Away</I>, just as Bell Atlantic is not welcome as a replacement for Uncle Sam. The 
reason is simple: Public broadcasters see themselves as an aristocracy and, like aristocrats 
everywhere, they find commerce beneath them. No matter that the U.S. Constitution 
prohibits titles of nobility; public broadcasters see themselves like the Dons of 18th-
century Spain, with neither dust on their boots nor soil of commerce on their hands.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic pose of public broadcasting, and protestations of independence 
from mainstream American tastes, is curiously dependent precisely on the patronage of 
the federal government. Otherwise, the status of the enterprise is no different from that of 
any other broadcasting entity. Indeed, the aristocratic pretension even informs the refusal 
of the public-broadcasting lobby on Capitol Hill to submit CPB to the Freedom of 
Information Act. To disclose information to the American public--to mere commoners--
would be to lose stature. The mystery of the enterprise would be disturbed, and without 
the mystery, there would be little majesty.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conceit also undergirds broadcasters' refusal to ensure, as the law 
requires, that programming is objective and balanced. The Public Broadcasting Act of 
1967 specifically calls for such balance in all matters of public controversy. This was 
necessary for the same reason Congress passed the ban on domestic dissemination of the 
Voice of America--that it would be dangerous to allow the federal government's power 
over the press to be exploited by a victorious political faction.</P> 
<P>	In 1992, after complaints of imbalance and the intercession of Senator Dole (R-
KS), Congress strengthened the statute to provide for a procedural review of 
programming and commissioning of remedial fare whenever public broadcasters violated 
standards of objectivity. Yet, after almost three years, the CPB has never admitted a 
single mistake, nor commissioned a single hour of remedial programming.</P>
<P>	A desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for this 
otherwise inexplicable phenomenon. For to admit error would be to place public 
broadcasting on the same plane as the commercial press. <I>The New York Times</I> prints 
corrections every single day. The <I>Washington Post</I> has an ombudsman. When NBC was 
caught rigging a crash test on Dateline NBC, the company fired the president of NBC 
News. But when PBS aired the fraudulent <I>Liberators</I>, which falsely gave credit for the 
liberation of Buchenwald to African-American troops instead of the 6th Armored 
Division, WNET in New York retracted it after substantial public pressure from Jewish 
groups and World War II veterans. Yet not a single head rolled, and no corrective 
programming was aired.</P>
<P>	The aristocratic conception of status also thrives in the relation of CPB to 
Congress. Although dependent on the federal government for its annual appropriation, 
the CPB regards its role as a "heat shield" against Congressional critics rather than a 
regulator. That is, public broadcasting must be permitted to receive federal funds and 
commission programming with no questions asked. The government-weary electorate 
demands accountability for tax money spent on every other government program. Yet 
public broadcasters stand with the National Endowment for the Arts as one of the few 
recipients who claim a special exemption.</P>

<H3>Kids as Shields</H3>
<P>	PBS's attitude is bad enough when it is programming for the "new class" of 
professionals and educators. But it is even worse when it hides behind supposed concern 
for the sensibilities of children. Commercials, one of the engines of revenue, are deemed 
hazardous by a cadre of "experts" in education and media, who need to certify shows as 
"educational."</P>
<P>	But here's the rub: When advertising aimed at children became increasingly 
restricted on the networks, PBS became the venue for licensing bonanzas connected to its 
shows. For example, over 5,000 products connected to Sesame Street are grossing almost 
$1 billion in annual sales. Yet the show is nevertheless considered "non-commercial" 
because it is certified as such by "experts" in educational psychology, such as Gerald 
Lesser, a founder of Children's Television Workshop (which created <I>Sesame Street</I>) and 
a professor at Harvard University's School of Education.</P> 	
<P>	PBS executives try to have it both ways. On the one hand, they shun commercial 
television because of its commercializing influence on children. On the other hand, those 
with the franchises for PBS shows enjoy exclusive advantages no other toy vendors can 
claim--for they carry the noble title, "educational," and the PBS seal.</P>

<H3>Big-Bucks Programming</H3>
<P>	In public broadcasting, the democratic institution of Congress, which is 
responsible to the taxpayer, relinquishes the power to approve programs to an unelected 
bureaucracy. In deciding who gets grants, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has 
depended on judgments from expert panels of industry insiders, rather than the board of 
directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Again, the principle is 
clear: CPB should be accountable neither to the marketplace nor to the taxpayers and 
their representatives.</P>
<P>	In fiscal year 1993, CPB distributed some $289.4 million to 200 affiliated 
television stations and 490 affiliated radio stations. That was about 14 percent of the 
total--about $2 billion--spent on public radio and television. By way of comparison, in 
fiscal year 1993, CBS was the number-one rated television network in the country, with a 
prime-time Nielsen rating of 14.0, and earned broadcasting revenues of about $2.3 
billion. At that time, public television stations spent about $1.2 billion for an average 
prime time rating of under 2.5. In other words, CBS was paying $164 million for every 
ratings point in 1993, while PBS was paying about $480 million per ratings point.</P> 
<P>	Were PBS viewers three times as valuable as network audiences, or was the 
federally-subsidized network simply paying three times as much to reach the same 
people? Rather than reaching the most people for the least amount of money--a 
democratic mission--public broadcasting strives to reach a select group of people, no 
matter the cost. Such targeting of consumers happens all the time in the commercial 
marketplace. But it's hard to justify for a democratically funded organization.</P> 
<P>	This phenomenon of elitist and parochial disdain, then, begins to explain the 
unwillingness of the public broadcasting lobby to engage in the debate over the specifics 
of public broadcasting. The problem is not lack of money. It is simple snobbery on the 
part of public broadcasters. Federal tax dollars are considered "clean." Private donations, 
sponsorship, or underwriting is considered "dirty."</P>
<P>	Could the public broadcasting system become self-sufficient? Of course. The 
money is already there, within the same system that has been growing for more than 27 
years. As President Clinton himself told Brian Lamb in a C-Span interview during the 
1992 campaign, the public broadcasting system is pretty healthy, and he "didn't know 
that we needed to spend any more money on it." The president's own budget line item for 
CPB has been essentially frozen since he took office, and his administration actually 
proposed a 6 percent cut for public broadcasting in its 1996 budget.</P>

<H3>Drawing from the Well</H3>
<P>	Where could taxpayer funding find a substitute? Any number of combinations and 
permutations of replacement funders spring to mind.</P>
<UL><LI>  More than 5.2 million members contribute some $391 million annually to public-
broadcasting stations. That's about $75 each. Since public-broadcasting membership 
represents the top stratum of the socioeconomic ladder, were each subscriber simply to 
pledge $56 additional each year, it would yield public broadcasting $290 million--the 
entire federal share. Not too difficult a challenge, considering that the average net worth 
of the membership of WETA, a PBS station in Washington, D.C., is $627,000, according 
to <I>USA Today</I>.<BR> 
<LI>  The private foundations that support public broadcasting are among the richest entities 
in America today. They include the multi-billion-dollar Ford, MacArthur, Warhol, and 
Rockefeller foundations. Certainly these vast accumulators of wealth could increase their 
contributions to public broadcasting as well. The Ford Foundation alone has a $6 billion 
endowment. If public broadcasting were a genuine priority for them, private foundations 
could make up the $290 million annual appropriation from their own bank accounts.<BR>
<LI>  The commercial radio and television networks that benefit from the fact that PBS and 
National Public Radio serve to crowd out potential competitors could fund public 
broadcasting in the same way that cable companies pay for C-Span, as a cost of doing 
business and a way of increasing corporate goodwill. Split between NBC, ABC, CBS, 
and Fox, the sum required would be about $75 million each, and no doubt the networks 
could barter programs onto the schedule as part of the contribution. This system was 
actually used by Margaret Thatcher's government in Great Britain to establish Channel 
Four--originally proposed as taxpayer-supported. A private corporation owned by the 
other commercial television companies and known collectively as Independent Television 
(ITV), Channel Four was so successful at nurturing alternative and diverse television 
programming that it has actually begun to support itself, even attracting commercial 
sponsors. It frequently draws better than the BBC's arts and cultural channel, BBC-2.<BR>
<LI>  Hollywood stars are quite vocal in their support of public broadcasting, lining up to 
testify at congressional hearings. But they haven't yet confessed that they are in a better 
position than most to make up for the federal share. Entertainer Barbara Streisand, who 
makes $10 million to $15 million per picture while warning about the deleterious effects 
of cutting public television funding, admitted in a recent speech at Harvard that 
Americans spend about $340 billion annually on the entertainment industry. A donation 
from the Hollywood moguls totaling only one-half of 1 percent of those receipts would 
amount to more than five times the federal share to all of public broadcasting.</UL>
<P>	What's going on here? Are CPB and its offspring, NPR and PBS, hapless paupers 
dependent on the federal dole? Or are they sophisticated business ventures whose profit 
potential remains untapped? Which is it? Although Streisand denounces conservatives for 
emphasizing the private sector, she has chosen to work with commercial Hollywood 
studios and record companies. Stars like Streisand, along with other "arts advocates" 
from groups like the Creative Coalition such as Blair Brown, Christopher Reeve, Ron 
Silver, and William and Alec Baldwin, could agree to donate their time to do one 
television special a year for public broadcasting. They could get their Hollywood friends 
to join them, and the programming could be used as pledge specials. If such stars 
appeared for free on PBS, their shows could be used for fundraising, much like <I>The Three 
Tenors</I> is used now.</P>
<P>	How much money could Hollywood raise for public broadcasting? You do the 
math: Streisand brought in a cool $1 million for then-candidate Bill Clinton at a 1992 
fundraiser. In 1986, she raised $1.5 million for a group of six Democratic congressional 
candidates. Forbes magazine estimates Streisand earned $52 million in 1994.</P> 
<P>	Other big-money show-business stars (according to Forbes) include Oprah 
Winfrey, who made $53 million last year, Bill Cosby ($34 million), Harrison Ford ($27 
million), Bruce Willis ($19 million), Tom Hanks ($16 million), Kevin Costner ($15 
million), Tom Cruise ($14 million), Eddie Murphy ($13 million), and Roseanne ($13 
million). The richest of them all is Steven Spielberg. Forbes magazine estimates 
Spielberg makes $165 million to $170 million annually.</P>
<P>	We know where at least some of their money goes. Spielberg donated $161,000 to 
Democrats running for Congress. Five studio political-action committees gave $866,798 
to Democrats (compared to $187,050 to Republicans). MCA chairman Lew Wasserman 
gave more than $230,000 to Democrats in 1992, compared to $6,000 to Republicans. In 
1992 Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg (now partnered with Spielberg and music mogul David 
Geffen in a new company) gave over $100,000 to Democrats and $2,000 to Republicans. 
Disney's Michael Eisner gave $19,000 to Democrats and $3,000 to Republicans. Eisner, 
it should be remembered, sold almost $200 million worth of Disney stock after the 
election of Bill Clinton because he feared higher taxes. That one transaction was worth 
almost the entire amount the Corporation for Public Broadcasting spent on PBS in 1992.</P>
<P>   With the biggest names from the silver screen appearing on PBS, there is no question 
but audiences would rise to the occasion. In fact, PBS President Duggan, in a speech to 
affiliates last year, said he would love to have a Barbra Streisand special on PBS for 
pledge week. No doubt CD sales alone would make a startling contribution to the PBS 
budget. Yet so far, Barbra is still operating in the commercial sphere. Why?</P>
<P>	Underwriters would surely love to be associated with top stars, and so private 
support would no doubt more than make up the federal shortfall. Indeed, producers like 
Norman Lear (founder of People for the American Way) might even agree to produce 
series for PBS and donate their fees as contributions, with residual rights reverting to 
PBS.</P>
<UL><LI>  As Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) showed, the telephone companies seem to be willing 
to provide free over-the-air educational and cultural programming in exchange for the 
right to enter the broadcasting business. Certainly regulators and corporations could 
arrange to make duplicate television stations available for other purposes while 
maintaining the core mission of public broadcasting as a cost of doing business.<BR>
<LI>  Cable companies like Jones Intercable also appear ready to step into the breach, 
providing public-service broadcasting in order to expand their activities. Such offers 
should be seriously considered. Another cablecaster expressing interest is the Discovery 
Network, which also runs The Learning Channel.<BR> 
<LI>  Finally, PBS could strike better deals with the producers of <I>Barney, Sesame Street, The 
Civil War, The Frugal Gourmet</I>, and the dozens of other extremely lucrative programs 
with merchandising tie-ins carried on the taxpayer-subsidized airwaves. Valuable air time 
is now given away for free to these producers, who know what to do with it. Producers of 
<I>Sesame Street</I>, for example, use the subsidized exposure to sell $800 million worth of 
some 5,000 licensed products annually. The show's producer, Children's Television 
Workshop, has about $70 million in stocks and bonds and pays its top executives more 
than $300,000 a year. Barney was estimated to sell about $500 million worth of products 
in 1993, and <I>Shining Time Station</I> garnered $250 million. Intelligent licensing deals alone 
could probably make up the lost federal subsidy from products connected to PBS's 
children's programming.</P></UL>
<P>	The recent announcement that CPB would get a share of <I>Barney's</I> net profits is 
unfortunately mere window dressing. In show business, only gross points are real dollars, 
and CPB does not share in the gross under any known contract. One reason that 
producers connected to public broadcasting have enjoyed such sweet arrangements is that 
the system is federally subsidized, There is no incentive to strike the most profitable deal. 
As media critic Brent Bozell noted in recent congressional testimony, it is very hard for 
public-broadcasting executives to go up to Capitol Hill and ask for increasing amounts of 
taxpayer money if they are making millions from selling T-shirts.</P>
<P>	And they are. The <I>Wireless</I> and <I>Signals</I> catalogs produced by Boston's WGBH 
and Minnesota Public Radio, for example, yield about $150 million in total. On the East 
Coast, PBS stations are partners in the Learningsmith chain of stores, pioneered by 
WGBH and WETA. On the West Coast, KCET owns a chain, The Store of Knowledge. 
Both are private firms that benefit from the cross-promotion, advertising, and corporate 
goodwill of their association with PBS. But their books are sealed to the public, exempted 
from the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
<P>	Public broadcasting can survive, indeed thrive, without a penny of scarce taxpayer 
dollars. There are many alternative sources of revenue, from station members, to 
corporate underwriters, to alternative programmers. Better deals can be struck with those 
who are exploiting the present system. The opposition to self-sufficiency is based not on 
practical considerations, but rather on an ideological commitment to the role of the 
federal government as the guarantor of culture and education--much as in Britain, where 
there are jams and jellies carrying the emblem, "by appointment to Her Majesty."</P> 
<P>	That is why the current debate over public broadcasting is so fierce. It is a 
struggle between those with an "unconstrained vision," in the words of economist 
Thomas Sowell, of an all-powerful central government run by an educated elite that does 
everything, including decide what is cultural and educational television. On the other side 
are those who feel a commitment to limited government. As Representative John Kasich 
(R-OH) recently put it, "the vast majority of people we hear from say, as we go into the 
21st century, government doesn't need to run a television station."</P>

Popular Culture.</B></I>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT></B>ashington is a city of monuments. Its grandest and most expensive is a work 
still in progress, but nearing completion: the District of Columbia itself, which 
commemorates the ruin of American liberalism.</P>
<P>	The D.C. government is bankrupt today because liberal policies have decimated 
its tax base. Washington is a hollow community of extreme rich and poor. Landlords and 
private employers have fled by the thousands, followed by nearly the entire middle class 
of taxpayers. Although Washington is the center of one of the most dynamic information-
based economies in the U.S, it has a declining population and a growing number of 
people below the poverty line. This year, twice as many households as in 1988 lack 
phones. In no other laboratory of democracy has the liberal experiment taken such pure 
form. Nowhere else have the results been so damning. </P>
<P>	The District is perhaps the most liberal city in America. Nine of every 10 
registered voters are Democrats, and the Socialist Workers Party fields more candidates 
for local office than the Republican Party. Conceived at the high tide of American 
liberalism, the District government is a product of its times, more concerned with the 
rights of groups than with the responsibilities of individuals. Many of the original office 
holders, political activists with no experience in private enterprise, are still in power 
today. The results are tragic. Among all U.S. states, the District has the highest per-capita 
murder and violent-crime rates, the highest percentage of residents on public assistance, 
the highest-paid school board, the lowest SAT scores, and the most single-parent 
families.</P> 
<P>	The political activists have built a government they can't afford. Although the city 
takes in an astounding $8,950 in revenue for every man, woman, and child in its 
jurisdiction (compared with $4,100 and $3,700 in nearby Maryland and Virginia, 
respectively), the District still manages to spend $1,000 more per person than it receives. 
The result is a budget deficit edging closer to $1 billion with each new audit. </P>
<P>	The victims of this ferociously progressive government are not the wealthy and 
privileged, but the middle class and beleaguered. Today, in some parts of the city, it 
seems entire neighborhoods are for sale. In places like Shepherd Park, Lincoln Park, 
Marshall Heights--communities once redolent of African-American pride and history--
there are lonely streets whose only splash of color appears on the real-estate signs that 
seem to sprout from every other garden plot. </P>
<P>	At the end of one of these streets stands the Florida Avenue Grill. From behind 
the counter of the often-crowded restaurant, Lacey Wilson Jr. has seen the District of 
Columbia ebb and flow. These days, it's mostly ebbing. Back in 1944, when Wilson's 
father opened his soul-food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th Street, 
near the LeDroit Park section of Northwest Washington, the city was a thriving 
community of educated descendants of freed slaves, flourishing family businesses, and 
urban sophistication. It was also a magnet of opportunity for blacks seeking to escape 
rural poverty. At mid-century, wartime Washington offered stable, well-paying white-
collar jobs in the federal bureaucracy. People came and put down roots. </P>
<P>	Eighteen years ago, when Lacey Wilson Jr. began working at the Grill full time, 
the neighborhood brimmed with well-kept houses and children playing. Today, the Grill 
stands alone in an otherwise vacant lot. In the short time since the District was granted 
home rule in 1974, Washington has gone from promised land to no-man's-land. "Most of 
the families who lived here have moved out to Maryland," says Wilson, himself a refugee 
to "the peace and quiet" of suburban Virginia. Those who stayed in the neighborhood, 
according to Wilson, are trapped in houses that have lost 30 percent of their value in the 
last eight years. </P>
<P>	Business used to be better, says Wilson. The vacant lot next door means more 
taxicabs can park at lunch time, but the crime that holds this city hostage each night has 
cut his after-dark dinner traffic by half. Proud of his restaurant's permanence in a 
turbulent world, Wilson stands below rows of signed photos of his famous patrons--
athletes, musicians, and local politicians, including a young Marion Barry glowing with 
promise before dissipation hardened his face and tarnished his reputation as a can-do 
mayor.</P>
<P>	Wilson and his patrons are concerned that Washington, once the incubator of 
America's black middle class, is now a place from which to escape. After reaching a peak 
population of 800,000, the city has withered to just 578,000 last year, and the trend has 
accelerated. Ten thousand residents desert the city each year. Even worse news is who is 
leaving: the homeowners, the entrepreneurs, the role models--in short, the black middle 
class. They are leaving for the suburbs, and with every defector, D.C. loses a taxpayer, 
which shrinks the tax base available for feeding a voracious welfare state that causes 
more frustrated residents to leave, and on and on.</P>
<P>	Census figures reveal that during the second half of the 1980s, 157,100 residents, 
or one-fifth of the entire population, moved out of the District. About half of those 
emigrants moved to Maryland and 12 percent to Virginia. According to the Greater 
Washington Research Center, black households earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a 
year made up a disproportionate number of these refugees. In their place, affluent, single 
whites are moving into the city, but not enough to offset the loss. The result is a city 
rapidly dividing into segregated communities of economic extremes.</P>
<P>	Ask people at the Florida Street Grill about middle-class flight, and they'll tell 
you it is the little things that make life difficult in the District. Thomas Jones, finishing up 
his lunch before driving back to his job in Virginia, says it costs too much to live in the 
city. "Not just money," he says, "but time and aggravation." The Grill attracts an 
unusually diverse crowd for Washington, but there is agreement on one point: The 
government is no longer a neutral referee for self-sufficient citizens, but a muscular 
competitor against private enterprise. "For all the forms I need to fill out and all the 
inspections I'd have to have--and I'm not even talking about the fees and taxes," says 
one would-be entrepreneur, "why should I do business here? They've got open arms in 
Maryland. They make it easy there." A discussion soon erupts over the merits of 
suburban life, including such "innovations" as drive-through car registration, a one-stop 
business office where permits and licenses are issued, and same-day street repairs. The 
District, on the other hand, offers a notoriously slow motor-vehicles department, a 
bureaucracy suspicious of any profitable endeavor, and patchwork streets that haven't 
seen new asphalt in years. </P>
<P>	Wilson, Jones, and a number of other patrons own at least one rental unit in the 
city--often the place they used to live in. Thanks to the city government, these units are a 
steadier source of frustration than of income. The District has some of the most stringent 
rent-control and tenant's-rights provisions in the nation, but instead of helping 
disadvantaged renters, the laws tend to discourage rental activity. "It's not worth it to rent 
out your property," says Jones. He tells a harrowing story of a tenant who exploited all 
the rules to live, rent-free, for more than 16 months. "She had me in court. Never paid me 
anything, and she had the nerve to sue me!" Wilson and others at the counter nod 
knowingly. "I'll never rent out again," Jones declares. "After getting it up to code, what 
with rent control, it takes you 20 years to get your money back."</P>
<P>	Behind the cash register at the Florida Avenue Grill stands Edgar Featherson, a 
native Washingtonian with a quiet, genteel grace that reminds you of the once courtly 
city. After the lunch crowd dwindles, Featherson drives home through the LeDroit Park 
neighborhood in the early afternoon. The sidewalks overflow with students from the four 
public schools in the area. The children are a concern to Featherson.</P>
<P>	"They don't have the kind of family I was blessed with," he says. He is proud of 
his education, much of it the result of lessons his mother drilled into him years ago. The 
world has changed dramatically since then. He tells a story of the time he prepared dinner 
for his nephew and a friend from the neighborhood. "This boy had never seen anything 
like it. I made them put their coats away and wash their hands before we sat down," he 
recalls. "By the end of the night, you know that boy would not leave the house? He never 
had anyone telling him how to act, never had anyone treat him like a normal child." With 
a mixture of disgust and guilt, Featherson shakes his head. "This boy was so starved for 
love, he wouldn't leave." </P>
<P>	Featherson's nephew doesn't go to public school. He attends Archbishop Carroll 
High School in another part of town, partly because parents there are more involved in 
their children's education than they are in D.C. public schools. "If you don't show up at a 
parent-teacher meeting at Carroll, you get fined," he says. "They'd never try that in 
public school." To Featherson, public education is a mechanism for downward mobility, 
not a ladder out of poverty. "Look at Franklin Smith [the Superintendent of D.C. Public 
Schools]. He sends his kids to private school. He has a choice and he doesn't even send 
his own children to public school. Now what does that say about D.C. schools?" </P>
<P>	He mentions a news item from the Washington Times, reporting that in the 
seventh-grade "intensive" English class at one of the city's elite junior-high schools, not a 
single book was assigned to the class during the entire year. "And that's in the best 
schools," he says. "You can imagine what they're like in the rest of the city."</P>
<P>	John Robinson, another Grill customer, founded Black Diamond Industries in 
1976 to manufacture stainless-steel kitchen equipment for McDonald's and Wendy's 
restaurants. He exudes a world-weary optimism. His office is decorated with a yellowed 
picture of Jackie Robinson and a framed portrait of his mother. Robinson has not left the 
city yet. "This is where I live, my family is here, my church is here," he says. Still, the 
thought crosses his mind often.</P>
<P>	"Paperwork is my Achilles' heel," says Robinson. "With 20 employees, if I have 
one person doing nothing but government paperwork, non-income producing paperwork, 
then I've got 5 percent of my work force doing useless stuff." Robinson complains that 
he is a good employer in a city that needs private-sector job creation, yet the city ignores 
his needs. </P>
<P>	"The D.C. government doesn't care about my business--they don't see us we're 
so small--but it's businesses like this, with under 50 people, that are the real job 
producers," Robinson says. Washington has become something of a private-sector jobs 
vacuum. Job creation since 1980 has been anemic: 7 percent growth in employment, 
compared with 40 percent in suburban Maryland and 94 percent in suburban Virginia. 
Had D.C. managed to create jobs at the national average, it would have generated 80,000 
more jobs between 1980 and 1993.</P>
<P>	"Small business is about family and the community," says Robinson. "I work 
here. I live in the city. I hire people from the neighborhood. The government should be 
encouraging me, not just some big corporation. When I complain to the city government, 
they say `What's the problem? Every other business can do it. Why can't you?' But I'm 
not Marriott, I'm not MCI. I can't wait six weeks for an inspection or a permit. I'm out of 
business in six weeks. I could do about $100,000 more business a year if I didn't have so 
much paperwork," says Robinson.</P>
<P>	The solution to the worst of his problems is simple, Robinson says. "The city 
should announce tomorrow, `If you've got less than 50 employees, you don't need a 
license, you don't need a permit, all you have to do is pay taxes on time.' Just let me go 
to work. Nothing would make my life easier than that."</P>
<P>   If you drive along Minnesota Avenue in Anacostia, you'll see few private businesses. 
Many of the small outposts of enterprise are liquor stores, and likely owned by Korean-
born entrepreneurs. Douglas Kim, a small-businessman and head of the Korean-American 
Chamber of Commerce, says that nearly a third of all business licenses in the District of 
Columbia are held by low-capital Korean merchants. Recent immigrants often start up in 
the more hostile parts of the District. The risks may be higher, but the initial investment 
required is small compared to the more affluent suburbs. "After six or seven years," says 
Kim, "they move their business out of the city." Surveys show that 96 percent of all 
Koreans who own businesses in the District already live in the suburbs. </P>
<P>	Koreans are torn between the city and the suburbs, Kim says. The crime rate 
disturbs them. A recent survey showed that 89 percent of Korean merchants felt the 
police were "untrustworthy" or "very untrustworthy." But the biggest obstacle to a 
thriving Korean community in D.C. is the public-school system. "We come here for a 
better life for our children," says Kim, who lives in Virginia so his children can attend 
public schools there. "You know, it's the American dream." Kim's wife, who immigrated 
more recently, is still uncomfortable with the anonymity of the suburbs. "When my boys 
graduate," he says, "we'll move back to the city, but not now. --If there were excellent 
public schools in the District like there are in Virginia, all the Koreans would be living in 
the city tomorrow!"</P>
<P>	Many of the D.C. refugees are doubtless fleeing crime and the city government's 
inability to protect them from it. Don Scoggins, a refugee himself, is a real-estate broker 
who has helped hundreds flee bleeding neighborhoods. "Crime is more devastating to 
these communities than racism or Jim Crow ever was," says Scoggins, "but the city 
officials still think they're leading the civil-rights movement. They'd rather talk about the 
`root causes of crime' instead of locking up the criminals."</P>
<P>	To Scoggins, a black government worker-turned-entrepreneur, the story is 
depressingly routine. "The people running D.C. are more concerned with the people who 
can't take care of themselves," he says, "at the expense of the rest of us, the ones who 
have made an investment in the city's future." </P>
<P>	Joe Corey is a restaurateur in the upscale Glover Park section of Northwest D.C. 
Though his business required a large initial investment, he's not so different from the 
Korean merchants across town. When he had a chance to expand his business, he chose to 
open a restaurant in Virginia instead of D.C. "The taxes are too high, the bureaucracy is a 
mess," he says. "I told [former city council chairman] John Wilson on a radio call-in 
show that I wanted to stay in the city, but I couldn't afford the time and effort. You know 
what he told me? `Don't let the door hit you on the way out.' Is that anyway to treat a 
taxpayer?"</P>
<P>	It's the small things that make Corey think of leaving town--like the city's 
passion for writing parking tickets. Most residents will agree that the one thing the 
government does with breathtaking efficiency is issue tickets. "To them it's another 
source of income, so sure they write as many as they can, whether they're valid or not," 
says Corey. Since there's revenue at stake, the city for once turns to the lowest-cost 
provider, a private corporation called Lockheed Information Management. "The city is so 
shortsighted," says Corey. "They ticket my customers so they can raise a couple of 
hundred dollars in revenue, and they drive the customers away. They don't think of the 
business I'm doing and the taxes I'm paying. My business is worth much more to them in 
the long run than the few bucks they'll get from parking tickets." </P>
<P>   Corey perceives a hostile climate for business in the District. "They neglect you if 
you're a taxpaying business," he says. "When I call the city government, I can never get 
the right person on the phone or the right answer to a question. I can call down there on a 
Wednesday afternoon and no one answers the phone at all. But if I lose an employee, that 
guy gets unemployment benefits the next day, and God help me if I make a mistake with 
unemployment insurance. They're all over me." Corey speculates that career city 
employees are suspicious of anyone making money. "In this city, non-taxpayers are more 
privileged than the ones who are paying the taxes." As a result, many businessmen have 
fled the District, leaving behind an anemic economy in which the Washington Post and 
McDonald's are two of the largest private employers.</P>
<P>	For the Washingtonians who have invested their lives in District neighborhoods, 
there is sometimes no escape. Benjamin Thomas has lived in Benning Heights since 
1958. "It's a nice neighborhood, good working people," he says, but for five years the 
community has been besieged by drug dealers and the murderous outgrowth of their 
trade. "We're overrun by crime. I heard gunshots just last night and no one will respond." 
The breakdown of law and order is almost total. "We've got cars driving around here 
with no license plates, never been inspected, parked anywhere they come to a stop." 
Overwhelmed by violent crime, the police don't bother to enforce the basic laws that 
protect a neighborhood from chaos. "We're completely surrounded here," says Thomas. 
His home is now on a hostile frontier, and he sees little chance to escape. "Where can I 
go? Even if I find somebody who wants to buy my house, I won't have enough money 
even for a down payment anywhere else."</P>
<P>	Thomas places the blame squarely on the city government. "I've written letters to 
the mayor, to the city council, but no one ever answers. We're on our own out here." 
Thomas recalls the city was unresponsive even before the neighborhood disintegrated. "I 
fought 10 years to get a traffic light on Benning Road [a major point of entry to the city], 
and I never heard a thing from downtown."</P>
<P>	As Ray Dickey sees it, the transformation from neighborhood to no-man's-land 
begins at home. Dickey says he was the first black to move into the North Michigan Park 
neighborhood, back in 1957. "It starts when parents don't spend time with their kids, and 
don't let their children's friends in the house." The children eventually get the message 
that they're on their own, and they grow up not caring about anyone but themselves. 
"Neighbors don't even talk to each other anymore," says Dickey. "Now I live in a 
neighborhood of strangers. It's sad."</P>
<P>	North Michigan Park suffers from a disorder that no amount of government 
largess can remedy. "It's not about money," he says. "Money won't fix it. Government 
can't bring these people together and make them care." Dickey looks for non-government 
institutions to help bridge the gap, but finds them badly weakened by middle-class flight. 
"There are 10 churches in this neighborhood," says Dickey, "but they're not part of the 
neighborhood anymore. The people coming to church are all from the suburbs. They 
come on Sunday for an hour, then leave. The rest of the week, the doors are locked."</P>
<P>	A government's main mission is to ensure the safety of its citizens. Yet in the 
middle-class neighborhoods of Ward 6, the police presence has been cut back just when 
the neighborhood needs it the most. "I'm trapped in my own home," says Sheila Stamps, 
a widowed mother of five living in public housing on Capitol Hill. "You can't let 
children out by themselves, and the playground is littered with intravenous needles." 
Marion Barry, the newly elected mayor, recently threatened to withdraw the police from 
Ward 6 unless its city-council representative supported a controversial tax increase. This 
news brings Stamps to a boil. "You can't touch the police and the fire department. That's 
public safety. You can't touch that and expect people to stay here much longer."</P>
<P>	Stamps knows what's wrong with her city and what to do about it. "There are two 
things that must be there," she says. "Public safety and good schools." She wants the 
police to build a substation in her neighborhood so the same policemen can live and work 
in the area. "We need police here so they can live with the problem, so they'll know what 
it is like." Stamps also wants school choice. "Any child in this city should be able to go to 
the best schools," she says. "If they meet the criteria, let them go." She says the 
politicians and the media people who live in affluent Ward 3 don't want poor black 
children in their schools. "The president can send his child to any school he wants." she 
says. All she wants is the same opportunity. "We've got a lot of smart kids down here, 
hard-working kids. But they don't get the chance."</P>
<P>	Based on the liberal premise that poor citizens will always be poor and affluent 
citizens will always be affluent, the District government is perplexed that middle-class 
citizens are seeking opportunity elsewhere. After hundreds of tax increases, the city's 
ledgers are soaked with red ink. Despite employing tens of thousands of civil servants, 
even basic services are abysmal. The solution parroted by city officials has always been 
to grant statehood to the District. The reality is that the city government has squandered 
what sovereignty it has. More than 50 of the city's agencies are under court control, and 
the District owes $21 million in contempt-of-court fees due to its mishandling of its 
limited responsibilities. </P>
<P>	There can be no solution to the District's problems until the flight of middle-class 
families is stanched and reversed. That will require the District government to compete 
with its suburbs to provide the basic services middle-class taxpayers expect. The city can 
attract new residents by emphasizing public safety and quality public education, and by 
providing a competitive regulatory climate for entrepreneurs and a low-capital point of 
entry to the economy. Projects and services that do not add to the appeal of Washington 
as a place to raise a family can no longer be justified. The city must close the law school 
of the University of the District of Columbia, which produces no lawyers, privatize the 
appalling D.C. General Hospital, and lower its tax rates to compete with those of 
surrounding jurisdictions. </P>
<P>	The solution is hardly draconian. Other cities take great pride in performing the 
basics efficiently. Washington has the advantage of being the kind of city many people 
would like to live in. But it must first shed its Great Society heritage. The D.C. 
government has betrayed the very people it was intended to serve. True, it has succeeded 
in creating an integrated community where African-Americans can live in peace and 
thrive economically. Unfortunately, that community is just over the District line--in 
Maryland's Prince George's County.</P>
<P>	Why does Featherson stay in the District? "Well, it's like the Grill," he explains. 
"We've been here so long, for 50 years. I just hope there are some kids who walk by and 
think, `They've made it, they've been here through everything, they're proof you can 
make it if you work hard.' That's why I stay here. I want these kids to say `If Mr. 
Featherson can make it, maybe I can too.'"</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT></B> tiny "Great Books" college in California, tucked away in a mountain meadow, 
would seem an unlikely minuteman in a struggle for the academic liberty of America's 
colleges, universities, and professional schools. But so it is. Thomas Aquinas College, 
named for the 13th-century Italian saint and patron of Catholic education, was among the 
first to resist the imposition of non-academic standards by regional accrediting agencies. 
Now the accreditors, who grant a scholastic seal of approval--and with it, access to 
federal assistance--are hoping to consolidate and centralize their power over dissident 
institutions.</P>
<P>	Armed with an agenda that includes politically correct notions of "diversity," an 
alliance of accreditors and Washington-based educrats is trying to establish a national 
accrediting body that would oversee every institution of higher learning in the country. 
No school that receives federal money would be immune from attack: By threatening to 
withhold accreditation, and thereby close off millions of dollars in government loans and 
other assistance, a centralized body could impose a political agenda at will.</P>
<P>	This is precisely the lesson in the recent flap over the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education, which insisted that medical schools require training in 
abortion procedures or else forfeit accreditation.</P>
<P>	If the move toward a centralized accrediting body succeeds, the private, collegial 
character of the review process will be in peril. Advocates of diversity and multicultural 
standards instead will be pitted against institutions striving to preserve high academic 
standards along with their own distinctive missions. The autonomy and quality of these 
institutions will be put in jeopardy.</P>
<P>	This is not a hypothetical fear. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
Education, a nationwide agency, recently voted for ideological reasons to deny 
accreditation to any obstetrics and gynecology program that fails to provide mandatory 
training in abortion procedures. A similar imposition of ideological mandates could occur 
if accreditation of colleges were centralized in one monopolistic organization.</P>
<P>	Accreditation has long been a valuable process in higher education. Until recently, 
it has involved private, professional peer review to make sure that colleges and 
universities actually provide the quality of education they claim to provide. Now 
proponents of "diversity" are using the process to impose politically correct educational 
standards on institutions striving to preserve their distinctive missions. In the name of 
advancing diversity within each institution, they are imposing their own version of 
conformity and threatening true diversity among institutions. At stake is America's 
historical commitment to the integrity, quality, and independence of its colleges.</P>

<H3>The Aquinas Model</H3>
<P>  Since its founding in 1971, Thomas Aquinas has offered only one kind of degree: a 
bachelor of arts in liberal education. Our curriculum is composed of the seminal books of 
Western civilization, and we are unabashedly Catholic. There are no majors, minors, or 
electives. There are no textbooks; we rely only on the original works of those who have 
thought deeply about man, nature, and God. There are no lectures; we hold seminars in 
which professors guide students toward an understanding of the authors before them. 
With its clear and distinctive academic vision, the college offers an exemplary version of 
a classical liberal education.</P>
<P>	We pursue no "affirmative action" for persons or texts. We look for the best 
teachers, the best books, and students willing and able to undertake the life of reason. As 
Catholics, we hold that one intellectual tradition is superior, and we ask our students to 
study in that tradition, as well as to read prominent critics of that tradition such as Marx 
and Nietzsche. We are not about the study of "culture," as the word is used today; we will 
not base our curriculum on authors consciously selected for their race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. Whether the author is St. Thomas or Machiavelli, however, we are studying 
not the man, but what he has to say about the true, the beautiful, and the good.</P>
<P>	Until the 1980s, schools such as Thomas Aquinas thrived under the nation's six 
regional accrediting agencies for senior colleges and universities. These accreditors 
respected their members' independence and judged them in light of their professed 
missions. Countries like France, with their centralized ministries of education, would not 
allow such an enterprise as this. America does, thanks to its tradition of non-
governmental accreditation.</P> 
<P>	The latest mutation in the accreditation process is a story that we at Thomas 
Aquinas College know only too well. Every college and university in the United States 
must periodically submit to a review by one of these private accrediting agencies. 
Without accreditation, schools lose academic credibility among their peers.</P>
<P>	The process in the United States has always been largely in the hands of private 
organizations of accredited schools. After World War II, however, the G.I. Bill and the 
growth of federal aid programs prompted the agencies to take on the additional role of 
approving colleges as the recipients of such funds. And as the gatekeepers of federal 
funds, the agencies in turn had to be approved by the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>	As schools became more dependent upon federal funds, the character of the 
accrediting agencies gradually changed. Control over funds gave them great leverage 
over colleges and universities. They became less collegial associations of institutions that 
testify publicly to the worthiness of a college, and more the rulers and regulators of these 
institutions. Now they are threatening to become the guardians of an ideological agenda 
and to advocate diversity standards and politically-correct curricula.</P>

<H3>Diversity over Quality</H3>
<P>	By 1988, with the rise of multiculturalism in academia, the threat was emerging in 
California. Our accreditor, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), 
began promoting more prescriptive standards. These included the following language: 
"The institution demonstrates its commitment to the increasingly significant role played 
by diversity of ethnic, social, and economic backgrounds among its members by making 
positive efforts to foster such diversity."</P>
<P>	Stephen Weiner, the executive director of WASC, wrote in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education that WASC's expectations for diversity "affect virtually every aspect 
of campus life, and, therefore, each of our accrediting standards." In one document, the 
new diversity policy is called "the cornerstone of a major new thrust." In other words, 
standards of integrity and academic quality no longer would form the sole basis for 
accreditation.</P>
<P>	The new policy was part of a national movement among accreditors to leverage 
their influence over federal funds on behalf of the cause of diversity. Specifically, the 
accreditors wanted to mandate race and gender preferences in hiring and admissions, as 
well as multiculturalism in the curriculum, on the grounds that they are intrinsic to 
academic quality.</P>
<P>	Colleges and universities began to worry about accreditation's new thrust. This 
concern was not without foundation. One school discovered that WASC evaluators were 
soliciting racial grievances from the faculty of a neighboring college. Another was told, 
in writing, that it had "failed to grasp the concept of diversity" and that its curricula 
would have to be "restructured." A third was ordered to alter the composition of its board 
of trustees and told that a religious profession required of its faculty was "not in 
conformity with [WASC's] expectations."</P>
<P>	Colleges where multiculturalism, feminist studies, and the like had been matters 
of internal dispute, to be resolved internally, became vulnerable to meddling by outsiders 
with a political agenda. Moreover, the traditional purposes of accreditation--frank, 
collegial criticism and public avowal of academic integrity--were undermined by the 
mistrust generated by this new agenda.</P>
<P>	The threat to our college was plain. If WASC meant what it was saying, it could 
not, in principle, accredit our college. In the eyes of the accreditors, Thomas Aquinas 
College is multiculturally incorrect.</P>
<P>	In a lengthy struggle, Thomas Aquinas College confronted WASC's usurpations. 
We rejected the diversity standards when we came up for reaccreditation in 1992. The 
accrediting team of scholars sent to visit the college came away impressed with our high 
academic standards; in response, WASC reaffirmed our accreditation for eight years. 
When WASC circulated to its members a policy statement purporting to clarify its brief 
and vague standards on diversity, Thomas Aquinas College took the lead in raising 
objections and mobilizing opposition. Other institutions, including the California Institute 
of Technology, the University of Southern California, and Stanford, joined us in 
expressing alarm at the WASC statement. Although WASC formally adopted that 
controversial statement, it now requires colleges only to "thoughtfully engage" the issue 
of diversity.</P>

<H3>The Empire Strikes Back</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the story does not end there. Education lobbyists and bureaucrats, 
led by Robert H. Atwell of the American Council on Education, are launching a 
counteroffensive. Atwell co-chairs an ad hoc group called the National Policy Board on 
Higher Education Institutional Accreditation (NPB), which advocates a national 
accreditation organization to police the regional groups and any possible competitors. It is 
being packaged as a way to resist federal regulatory overreach into academia. Don't 
believe it.</P>
<P>	NPB is proposing an organization with unprecedented accrediting clout. It would 
set national standards for all institutional accreditors--in effect, all the agencies that the 
Department of Education uses to determine eligibility for federal money. The 
organization would be both "more specific" in its standards and "more rigorous" in its 
processes. It would establish its own budget, levy dues to be collected by the regional 
accrediting agencies, and wield the authority to impose sanctions against accrediting 
agencies that fail to enforce its standards. This would be the closest thing the nation has 
ever had to a national ministry of education.</P>
<P>	How would Thomas Aquinas, or any college with a distinct mission, fare under 
such a scheme? What would happen to the quality of American higher education?</P>
<P>	The answers are clear from the proposed organization's core standards, which 
include diversity. There is good reason to believe that this new board would promote 
diversity standards nationwide. In fact, the very existence of schools grounded in a 
clearly defined academic philosophy would be at great risk. Atwell has written that 
"diversity among institutions does not satisfy the need for diversity within institutions." 
In other words, colleges and universities whose curricula are specifically dedicated to the 
"great books," a traditional liberal-arts curriculum, a theological focus, or any other 
coherent body of belief would be subject to the multicultural whims of a remote 
bureaucracy.</P>
<P>	Such diversity also could be applied to the internal, everyday workings of all 
institutions that rely upon accreditation: student and faculty composition, trustee 
membership, allocation of resources, and on and on. Atwell has advocated a 
"comprehensive approach that encompasses the makeup of the faculty, student body, and 
staff; the curriculum offered by the institution; and the climate on the campus itself." 
Such a vision invites not diversity, but rather a leveling of the very differences in 
academic emphasis and philosophy that have helped create the finest educational non-
system in the world.</P> 
<P>	Opposition to the new accrediting entity is growing. Among others, American 
University, Boston University, Baylor, Caltech, Holy Cross, John Hopkins, Pepperdine, 
Rice, Stanford, Smith, the University of Dallas, the University of Southern California, the 
University of Missouri, and the University of Vermont all oppose the plan. Congressmen 
William Goodling (R-PA), chairman of the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, and Howard McKeon (R-CA), chairman of its higher 
education subcommittee, have written to Education Secretary Richard Riley: "We would 
certainly oppose any attempt to use accreditation--to impose standards unrelated to the 
fiscal interests of American taxpayers which could force schools to change their nature or 
their mission."</P>
<P>	It is not enough, however, to defeat the nationalization plan or fight WASC to a 
stalemate. A genuinely open and collegial system of accreditation, one that allows 
governments to catch fraud and abuse and yet steers clear of political correctness, is 
clearly needed. Like most college presidents, I would prefer to devote my energies to the 
growth and prosperity of my college, to its unique curriculum, and to its ardent, inquiring 
students.</P>
<P>	My experience with accreditation leads me to suggest a policy of decentralization 
and reform to protect the diversity of ideas, programs, and institutions that has served our 
republic so well over centuries.</P>

<H3>An Outline for Reform</H3>
<P>	First, it is essential to restrain the federal government's impulse to govern higher 
education. The federal government may want to promote college and university 
education, for example through subsidies for student loans. But federal aid should permit 
individual students and their families maximum choice, and leave schools free of 
burdensome and possibly ideological regulations.</P>
<P>	Liberal education, with its historical roots in religion and philosophy, deals in 
those ultimate questions that the  American political tradition leaves to associations other 
than the government. That is why, when the G.I. Bill provided federal dollars, the 
gatekeeping function was assigned to non-governmental accrediting agencies.</P> 
<P>	Second, non-governmental accreditation in its present form--regional monopolies 
like WASC--should confine itself to screening out incompetence and fraud. An 
accrediting agency is not, and cannot be, purely private, since it can shut off federal 
money. Recognizing this power, it must show proper restraint. In the short run, such a 
modest role, in which any criticism is non-binding, is less open to abuse than any form of 
regulation, particularly regulation by state governments, which sometimes serve as 
strongholds of the diversity forces.</P>
<P>	The most lasting way to forestall abuse is to break the monopoly. Federal policy 
should therefore favor the formation of high-quality, alternative accreditation agencies, 
perhaps tailored to institutional types: research universities, liberal-arts colleges, or, to 
address the latest outbreak of academic intimidation, pro-life medical schools. Such 
agencies, being genuinely voluntary, can better accommodate their members than one-
size-fits-all monopolies whose standards must measure institutions as diverse as institutes 
of psychology, comprehensive universities, liberal-arts colleges, and research 
universities. Colleges would have an incentive to earn recognition from truly 
independent, private accreditors, since their approval would mean something. The 
resulting competition and emulation would promote quality much more effectively than 
the present system.</P>
<P>	Third, a limited intervention against rogue accreditors who misuse their delegated 
powers can be useful, at least until the monopolies are effectively broken. One instance of 
prudent intervention occurred when Lamar Alexander, then U.S. Secretary of Education, 
restrained the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools when it tried to bully 
Baruch College and Westminster Theological Seminary into accepting diversity 
standards. But it is better to fashion one's own freedom, as we have tried to do within 
WASC, or as would result from the emergence of alternative accreditors.</P>
<P>	Centralization of regional accreditors is exactly the wrong way to go. It was an 
enormous labor for us to alert some of the 145 schools in WASC to the threats posed by 
regional bureaucracy. I seriously doubt that a stronger bureaucratic organization based in 
Washington, D.C., with a membership in the thousands, could ever be moved with a 
similar effort.</P>
<P>	I understand the desire for accountability when federal funds are involved, and I 
understand the natural ambition on the part of the new Congress to reform from the top 
down, but I think it should be resisted. We should remember what happened to the 
national history standards in Goals 2000. First proposed by Lynne Cheney, the head of 
the National Endowment of the Humanities under President Bush, they were hijacked by 
the educators commissioned to execute the project. At the same time, we should move to 
prevent the centralization of the accrediting process.</P>
<P>	The existing national educational bodies that offer to implement reforms tend to 
support fads like the diversity movement, and will try to regiment independent schools. 
Such centralization brought us mandatory training in abortion procedures among 
accredited medical schools.</P>
<P>	We must not set up a shadow national ministry of education under the guise of 
privatization, efficiency, or better standards.</P>
<P>	Its bureaucrats will be no better than government bureaucrats, and even less 
accountable. Above all, colleges and universities will merit the trust of the public and the 
government if they hold true to the timeless standards enunciated by St. Thomas Aquinas 
seven centuries ago: "The study of philosophy is not directed to the various opinions of 
men, but to the truth of things." Truth, not diversity, is the goal of education.</P>

<P>	   <B><FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT></B>n New Year's Eve 1975, after an evening of taking LSD and watching cop 
shows on television, 15-year-old Raul Meza showed up at a convenience store near his 
house in Austin, Texas, armed with a deer rifle. Meza emptied the cash register, then 
marched the clerk, a 20-year-old college student named Derly Ramirez, into the walk-in 
freezer. Meza shot him in the back and left him for dead.</P>
<P>	Ramirez recovered to testify against the man who wounded him. Meza received a 
20-year sentence, and served five years before getting out on parole.</P>
<P>	On January 3, 1982, months after his release, 21-year-old Raul Meza abducted 
Kendra Page, a third-grader, as she rode her bicycle near her home in southeast Austin. 
Meza tortured, raped, and strangled the girl, then left her body behind a dumpster. Three 
days later, he surrendered to the police. Meza received 30 years for the killing.</P>
<P>	While behind bars, Meza racked up demerits for various infractions, and four 
years were added to his sentence after guards found a knife in his cell. Meza came up for 
parole seven times, and each time it was denied.</P>
<P>	By 1993, however, prison authorities could keep Meza no longer. Under Texas 
law, he had accumulated enough credit for good behavior to qualify automatically for 
release. The state freed him under mandatory supervision, a conditional release not unlike 
parole that can be granted without the consent of the parole board.</P>
<P>	No matter how notorious, most felons leave prison with little fanfare. They re-
enter society quietly and soon become anonymous. Some begin new and honest lives. 
Many others, freed from supervision and accountable to no one, commit new crimes. 
Raul Meza might have regained his freedom in the same way. But he never got the 
chance. One hundred and forty miles from Meza's Huntsville prison cell, an Austin 
newspaper editor decided to make him famous.</P>
<P>	In 15 years of covering crimes, Jerry White, the city editor of the <I>Austin 
American-Statesman</I>, had watched scores of criminals disappear from public view after 
sentencing. Most of them left prison years before their sentences expired, often to rob, 
rape, or kill again. "It became apparent," says White, "that even though these folks are 
sentenced and sent away, the story doesn't really end." White began compiling a list of 
inmates who were "fairly notorious" in Austin. Every few months, he called the 
department of corrections to ask when inmates on his list would be eligible for parole.</P>
<P>	In June 1993, the department of corrections confirmed that Meza was due to be 
released soon. Using the state's Open Records Act, the newspaper petitioned Texas's 
attorney general and found where Meza planned to live. An article ran on the front page 
of the Sunday paper eight days before Meza's release. The headline read, "`Nothing's 
Going To Stop It': Killer of 8-Year-Old About to be Freed."</P>
<P>    In a city of about 465,000 people, the story reached 240,000 homes and provoked an 
outpouring of media attention. Film crews greeted Meza as he walked out of the state 
prison and followed him for months. Publicity, mostly bad, seemed to trail him 
everywhere. Corrections officials moved him from town to town, but in each residents 
and local politicians protested his presence. Colin Amann, a Houston lawyer who 
represented the killer after his release, says angry citizens "kicked him in the butt from 
one end of Texas to the other."</P>
<P>	For much of 1993, Texans kept on kicking. Over several months, he was shuttled 
between towns and cities all over the state. Of the 276 halfway houses that were asked to 
accept Meza, 271 refused. "Every town he went to," says Amann, "people were just 
screaming and yelling. Lots of small communities went out and bitched about it. A lot. 
And it happened every time they'd move him, they had the same outcry."</P>
<P>	In August, the parole division placed Meza on his grandparents' farm, west of San 
Antonio. On August 31, local sheriffs charged Meza with "terroristic threatening" and 
disorderly conduct for bullying his elderly grandparents. A judge later dismissed the 
charges, but the incident made nearly every newspaper in Texas. At least 1,000 local 
residents signed a petition asking the state to move Meza again. The parole division sent 
him to Austin.</P>
<P>	His new neighbors protested, held rallies, carried signs. A few moved away. The 
furor subsided a bit when the father of the murdered girl publicly called for citizens to 
give Meza the chance to start a new life. He moved into his mother's house and found a 
job. In the first 10 months of 1994, the <I>American-Statesman</I> ran more than 20 stories on 
Meza. In August 1994, he was arrested for violating the curfew provision of his parole, 
and he returned to the state prison in Huntsville.</P>
<P>	At the time Meza was taken into custody, there were more than 116,000 parolees 
in Texas, 15,000 of whom had outstanding warrants for parole violations. Yet the 
governor's fugitive squad focused its energies on Meza, the most famous one. And while 
parolees in Texas routinely get three chances to break parole before being arrested, Meza 
was taken into custody after only one violation. His supporters cried foul. But the citizens 
of Texas were the better for it.</P>
<P>   Meza needed all the attention he could get. As a group, violent sex offenders have an 
extraordinarily high rate of recidivism. In Texas, about one-third of convicted rapists are 
arrested for new crimes within two years of getting out on parole. Ordinarily, parole 
officers are not able to supervise sex offenders carefully. But because they learned from 
news reports where Meza lived, neighbors were able to keep their children out of his 
path. Relentless publicity forced a troubled parole system to work effectively. And 
information disseminated by the press helped to create thousands of civilian parole 
officers--watchful neighbors who kept an eye on him.</P>
<P> 	Publicity, however, is a blunt instrument, and others were unintentionally 
bludgeoned by Meza's fame. His relatives were humiliated. His victim's parents saw their 
tragedy replayed in the press. And Meza himself was hounded across the state. Nobody 
knows how such attention may have retarded his rehabilitation, but it may not matter. 
Despite the burdens imposed on him and his family--or, more likely, because of them--
Meza did not kill another child while out of prison.</P>
<P>	Even Meza's attorney, a self-described liberal, believes the publicity was worth 
the cost. "I think everybody should know when a parolee is coming to live in their 
neighborhood," says Colin Amann. "That's why crime is committed, because people 
don't know who the criminals are. Once they get out, let's let the entire world know 
where they are going to live. Let's let the community have some responsibility for 
keeping its thumb on them."</P>
<P>	More and more communities are clamoring for that very responsibility. Meza's 
case illustrates what most people already sense: Citizens who know their neighbors will 
be safer than those who don't. Study after study has shown anonymity to be a factor in 
many crimes. Simply put, criminals are more apt to commit crimes in neighborhoods 
where they do not know the neighbors, and where the neighbors do not know one 
another. As James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein explain in <I>Crime and Human 
Nature</I>, their expansive survey of criminology, "the more rapid the population turnover in 
an area, the higher the victimization rate, even after controlling for the racial and age 
composition."</P>
<P>	Conversely, close-knit communities tend to be resistant to predatory crime. A 
criminal is less likely to commit crimes where the neighbors recognize him, particularly if 
they know that he has a criminal record.</P>
<P>	Statistics explain why citizens have a vested interest in knowing who in their 
neighborhood has been convicted of serious offenses. Ex-cons commit a staggering 
amount of crime. As John DiIulio of Princeton University has pointed out, "within three 
years of sentencing, while still on probation, nearly half of all probationers are placed 
behind bars for a new crime or abscond." Nationally, recidivism for parolees is about the 
same as for probationers. DiIulio cites a revealing study of Florida convicts:</P>
<P>	"Between 1987 and 1991, about 87 percent of the 147,000 felons released from 
Florida prisons were released early. Fully one-third of these parolees committed a new 
crime. At points in time when they would have been incarcerated had they not been 
released early, these parolees committed nearly 26,000 new crimes, including some 4,656 
new crimes of violence--346 murders, 185 sexual assaults, 2,369 robberies, and 1,754 
other violent offenses."</P>
<P>	Not only are felons on supervised release dangerous, but there are a lot of them. In 
1993, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a total of 671,000 Americans were on 
parole or probation. There is considerable evidence that many parole and probation 
officers are responsible for far more offenders than they can possibly supervise, even 
those housed under one roof. A investigation in 1993 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 
that one of every six convicted felons placed in Colorado halfway houses escaped. That 
year, the study found, 526 felons walked away from halfway houses and into the 
surrounding neighborhoods. Seven of the escapees were convicted murderers. "In most 
cases," the paper concluded, "no one looked for them."</P>
<P>	Informed neighbors don't always just keep offenders from committing crimes; 
sometimes they can help ex-cons straighten out. Mike Elsworth got out of prison in 
Washington, D.C., for the last time on Halloween 1990, after serving two years for 
selling cocaine. Elsworth, who was paroled to the same part of town where he grew up, 
credits his neighbors for helping him keep his record clean since his release. Although he 
was shunned by at least one woman on his block, other "neighbors were supportive and 
understanding of me trying to do better once I got out. They knew I was looking for a job, 
and they would tell me about places that they knew were hiring, and some of them would 
tell me if I needed anything to come on by." Three months after his release, with the 
encouragement of his neighbors, Elsworth found a job.</P>
<P>	Elsworth says his neighbors gave him the help and attention his parole officers 
did not. In two years, Elsworth reported to five different officers. "It was like, every three 
months I had a new one," he says. "I don't know why. They really had little or no 
concern about me as a person." Elsworth met with his parole officer for 10 to 15 minutes 
every few weeks. But he saw his neighbors every day, which ultimately, he says, made all 
the difference.</P>
<P>	Of course, not all neighborhoods would take advantage of more information about 
felons. In some parts of cities, particularly in poor areas where citizens tend to live 
chaotic lives, neighbors often know who is on parole and don't care. Nor would giving 
neighbors the names and addresses of all newly released felons always benefit the felons 
themselves. Critics have long charged that releasing the names of parolees and 
probationers to the public would make it more difficult for convicted criminals to start 
successful new lives once they get out of prison. A federal judge recently struck down 
parts of "Megan's Law," a New Jersey statute requiring released sex offenders to tell 
their communities where they live. In his decision, Judge Nicholas Politan said the 
notification requirement amounted to a form of punishment, and cannot be added to 
penalties already in place before the law was passed in 1994. Requiring a convicted felon 
to notify his neighbors upon release, he wrote, would constitute a "lifelong albatross," 
and would ruin an ex-con's ability to "return to a normal, private, law-abiding life in the 
community." Judge Politan might be right. Ultimately, however, much of what would 
happen if the names of parolees were publicized is conjecture. As it stands, the identities 
of released criminals often remain shrouded in state and federal privacy laws. The Federal 
Privacy Act of 1974, for instance, generally bars authorities from divulging the names 
and addresses of parolees released from federal prisons. Most states, wary of civil-rights 
lawsuits brought by released felons, have adopted similar laws. While the intent of such 
statutes may be noble, their effect has sometimes been devastating.</P>
<P>	Last summer, the residents of Red Hook, a small town in upstate New York, paid 
the price for having an unknown felon in their midst. In June, Richard Moran, a lifelong 
criminal from the Bronx, was released from Rikers Island, where he had spent the 
previous three months on a parole violation, and placed in Red Hook's only homeless 
shelter. No one knew his criminal record. No one was watching.</P>
<P>	Had Moran's record become public, Tommy McCauliff, a 29-year-old with 
cerebral palsy, might still be alive. On a Sunday afternoon in July, McCauliff emerged 
from his apartment, staggered across the street, and bled to death on the sidewalk from a 
knife wound in his back.</P>
<P>	Police picked up Moran and charged him with second-degree murder. He was 
later convicted.</P>
<P>	By the time he came to Red Hook, Moran had spent close to half of his 43 years 
behind bars. First arrested in New York City for armed robbery in 1969, he went on to 
amass 26 different criminal charges, including several violent felonies. Within days of 
being released, Moran made his way to Shelter Plus, a state-financed boarding house for 
vagrants in Red Hook, 90 miles north. Under circumstances that are still not clear, he met 
Tommy McCauliff.</P>
<P>	When an inmate with two or more convictions is released from a state prison in 
New York, within 48 hours corrections officials must notify the police in the town to 
which he is headed. Rikers Island, however, is not a state prison, but a jail run by New 
York City. Authorities there were not required to notify police in Red Hook that Moran 
was on his way to their town. And they didn't.</P>
<P>	The state's department of social services in nearby Poughkeepsie was the only 
agency that knew about Moran's arrival in Red Hook, and New York's confidentiality 
laws require social workers to keep secret the criminal histories of their clients.</P>
<P>	"Anything in our records is confidential," says John Battistoni, the county's 
commissioner of social services. "Parolees just come in like anyone else. If they're 
without a place to go, we're required to give them shelter." Only a court order, he says, 
can force the department to divulge the names of the parolees it places in homeless 
shelters. A call from the local police department will not suffice. For employees who 
break confidentiality rules, says Battistoni, "the penalties could be severe. You'd be 
subjecting yourself and your county to all sorts of suits. It's tough stuff."</P>
<P>	All things considered, says Battistoni, he is not bothered by the secrecy. "I 
suppose people shouldn't be branded," he offers. "People are saying they'd like to know 
if a criminal is placed in their neighborhood. I often wonder what they would do with the 
information if they had it. Put a 24-hour tail on the guy?"</P>
<P>	Lisa Murray has no doubt what she would do with such information. "I would 
keep an eye on that person," she says, "and I would know if that person was near my 
child, if it was a rapist or a child molester, to get my kid away." Murray is one of five 
Red Hook women who formed a group called Concerned Citizens for a Safe Community 
after McCauliff's death. The group advocates changing the confidentiality laws they 
believe were partly responsible for the killing.</P>
<P>	Murray points out that Richard Moran is not the only criminal to move into the 
homeless shelter without the town's knowledge. Since McCauliff's death, police have 
arrested two other residents of Shelter Plus for selling drugs. "Whenever somebody gets a 
DWI or commits a robbery, it's in the paper before they're even convicted of the crime," 
she says. "So why not have a criminal who's already been convicted of a crime and 
released from prison be put in the paper saying where he's going to live?"</P>
<P>	A county legislator named Woody Klose quickly sponsored a resolution requiring 
local police to be notified whenever felons are placed in homeless shelters. Steve Saland, 
a state senator, sponsored a bill that would force corrections officials to notify towns 
whenever a parolee is about to be released into their midst. Unlike the statute in place, the 
new law would apply to jails as well as state prisons. It would require authorities to notify 
the mayor and the chief of police of the town to which the parolee is headed, as well as 
officials in the town where the crime was committed. The written statement would 
include the ex-con's physical description, his known aliases, and his criminal record. It 
would also contain his new home address. Towns would have to post the information in a 
public place, such as a bulletin board in city hall, in post offices, or in advertisements in 
local newspapers. Released offenders would be required to report to local authorities for a 
period of 10 years each time they moved to a new address in New York.</P>
<P>	Saland's notification law would apply only to paroled sex criminals, repeat 
violent offenders, and those convicted of three or more felonies. Saland says the law 
would not prevent parolees from committing new crimes. But it might help neighbors to 
protect themselves from released criminals. "All you can do is provide notice," he says. 
After that, "it's up to the community."</P>
<P>	Tommy McCauliff's death prompted New York politicians to take a new look at 
an old debate. For years, lawmakers have tried to balance the requirements of public 
safety with a belief that stigmatizing released felons makes rehabilitating them more 
difficult. Many states have compromised by requiring parolees and convicted criminals to 
register their addresses with law-enforcement officials, but not with neighbors or 
community groups. States that do provide for community notification when a felon is 
released nearly always limit the notification to cases involving sex offenders.
<P>	Most states that have such laws leave their application to the discretion of law 
enforcement officers. Often police departments get to decide which sex offenders 
constitute a threat to their neighbors. Although the state of Washington allows police to 
release photographs of and information about convicted sex offenders to community 
groups, and news outlets, the law is not always used. In the first 10 months of 1994, for 
instance, county police in Spokane notified the public only once of a paroled sex 
offender, though several were released into the area. Carol Dorris, who follows crime 
legislation for the National Victim's Center, says it is not unusual to see effective laws 
passed, then ignored. "It's fine to put in statutes and legislate something," she says, "but 
to enforce them is a lot harder to do."</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, recent developments show that concerned citizens have several 
outlets for civic action:</P>
<H3>Legislative Action</H3>
<P> The inability of probation officers to effectively track offenders 
argues for comprehensive notification laws--let the community provide the surveillance 
that the state cannot or will not. So far, such laws exist only in theory. For fear of 
destroying an ex-con's chances of success after release, no state has passed laws that 
would give the public the names and addresses of all parolees and probationers.</P>
<P>	Louisiana, however, has taken the lead in warning communities about released 
sex offenders. In 1992, the legislature passed two laws that ensure sex offenders will 
never again live anonymously in Louisiana. Or, as a later revision to the laws put it, 
"Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy." 
In fact, a person convicted of one of the state's 18 sex offenses can expect practically no 
privacy at all.</P>
<P>	The two laws and their amendments are vast in scope. No later than 10 days 
before a sex offender gets out of prison, corrections officials must send letters warning of 
his impending release to his victims, witnesses who testified against him, and the sheriff 
of the parish (county) to which he is going. Once he gets out, a sex offender must register 
with the sheriff and provide his fingerprints, his photograph, his social-security number, 
and any aliases he has used. The ex-con must also give the sheriff a description of his 
offense, including the date and place he committed it, and his home address. Offenders 
who move within the state of Louisiana have 10 days to re-register. The process 
continues for 10 years after their release.</P>
<P>	If his victim was a juvenile at the time of the offense, the offender must notify his 
neighbors as well. Twice within his first month out of prison, he must purchase an 
advertisement in his local newspaper. The ads must reveal his name, his address, and his 
offense. Descriptions of the crimes must be written in language ordinary citizens can 
understand; statute numbers do not suffice. To verify that it meets these specifications, 
the ad must pass muster with a parole officer.</P>
<P>	One such classified advertisement, which appeared in the <I>New Orleans Times-
Picayune</I> on May 8, 1994, is typical of the genre. "John Jones of 701 Teche St.," it said, 
"was convicted of a Sex Offense, Simple Rape." Another, on June 10, 1994, advertised, 
"I, Jim Davis, was convicted of molestation of a juvenile." [<I>Policy Review</I> has changed 
the names.] Other ads placed in the paper in June mentioned carnal knowledge, sexual 
battery, and indecent behavior with a juvenile.</P>
<P>	Once he has notified the larger community of his crime, an offender must tell his 
neighbors about it. The parolee must send letters or postcards with the same 
information--name, address, and offense--to every house within three blocks of his 
home. In cities, this usually means 36 square blocks and hundreds of houses. A parolee 
who lives in a rural area must send letters to everyone within a one-mile radius of his 
house.</P>
<P>	Finally, a sex offender whose victim was under 18 must contact the 
superintendent of the public-school district in his parish, as well as the principals of any 
private or parochial schools in the area.</P>
<P> 	If it chooses, a parole board also "may order any other form of notice which it 
deems appropriate, including but not limited to signs, handbills, bumper stickers, or 
clothing labeled to that effect." All of the expenses involved in the notification, such as 
stamps, envelopes, and advertising fees--not to mention any specially-labeled clothing 
the parole board may require--must be borne by the parolee. If at any time he fails to 
meet any requirement, an offender may be returned to prison.</P>
<H3>Citizen Journalists</H3>
<P>When John Roger, president of the Bayview Civic League in 
Norfolk, Virginia, asked the local police department to release the names of parolees who 
had moved into his neighborhood, it refused. Undeterred, Roger sought information at the 
other end of the criminal justice system: arrestees.</P>
<P>	Unlike the addresses of released felons, arrest records are publicly available from 
the police department. Every month, the league's newsletter, <I>Bayview Bylines</I>, publishes 
the name, race, and home address of each person taken into custody by the police within 
the boundaries of the Bayview neighborhood. Periodically, in a feature called "Pervert 
Alert," Roger also provides descriptions of flashers, peeping Toms, and other unsavory 
characters seen in the area. To pay for printing, local merchants buy advertising space in 
the newsletter. "Want to know why we do it?" he asks. "It's simple. We live here. We 
believe our members have a right to know what's going on."</P>
<P>	Though he prints only 4,000 copies of the newsletters, Roger is confident they 
reach many more people. Residents read it, he says, not only out of a fear of crime, but to 
"find if somebody they know has been arrested." The publicity can have consequences. 
Landlords, says Roger, scan the names of arrestees. "If it happens to be one of their 
tenants, they get rid of him."</P>
<P>	Although it remains difficult in most states to learn the whereabouts of parolees, 
there are other ways citizens can gather information on potentially dangerous criminals. 
In July 1994, John Johansen, a financial consultant in Arlington, Virginia, published the 
first issue of <I>Crime Prevention Bulletin</I>, a quarterly newspaper with a circulation of 
30,000. Police departments in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia 
cooperated with Johansen, giving him the photographs and last known addresses of 
fugitives in the area. Johansen printed the mug shots, some beneath headlines like 
"Wanted for Murder." The papers were distributed throughout the area by members of 
neighborhood organizations.</P>
<P>	The Bulletin was an instant success. In many cases, fugitives were still living in 
the same areas, even at the same addresses, amid neighbors who had no idea they were 
wanted by the law. Local police did not have the resources to track down each of the 
fugitives. But they could respond to tips provided by citizens who recognized their 
neighbors in the <I>Bulletin</I>. In its first six months, police credited Johansen's newspaper 
with the arrests of 15 fugitives in Washington alone. Six of them were suspected 
murderers.</P>
<H3>Do-It-Yourself Advertising</H3>
<P> Sanford "Sandy" Krasnoff, the president of Victims and 
Citizens Against Crime, in Lousiana, says his group devotes much of its energy to 
making certain the state's sex-crimes laws achieve their desired effect. Every Saturday 
morning, the flamboyant Krasnoff, who at various times in his career has been a New 
Orleans cop, a lawyer, and a manager of professional prize fighters, hosts a radio show 
called "Crime Watch." Each week, during three hours of air-time donated by the station, 
Krasnoff announces the names, addresses, and crimes of all sex offenders released on 
parole or probation in Louisiana in the previous week. Krasnoff gets the information 
directly from the parole and pardons board.</P>
<P>	Krasnoff's group also monitors offenders after their release. A volunteer, whom 
Krasnoff refers to as "the sex lady," scans newspapers for advertisements placed by 
parolees under the new law. When he saw that some of the ads were "coming out in 
mumbo-jumbo, referring to act numbers and statutes instead of telling people exactly 
what they were charged with," Krasnoff wrote a letter to the department of corrections, 
which promptly instructed parole officers to reject such ads.</P>
<P>	According to William T. Price, the deputy director of the state's adult probation 
and parole division, the state's new sex-offender laws have not prompted violence from 
the public. In a few cases, people moved upon learning that a child molester had come to 
their neighborhood. But, he says, nobody has yet thrown a fire bomb.</P>
<P>	Price does worry that the laws may be too broad, covering not only child 
molestation and forcible rape, but also non-predatory crimes like bigamy. "If you can 
attach the concept of sex to it," says Price, a crime probably falls under the rubric of the 
new laws.</P>
<P>	For all its willingness to publicize the names and addresses of sex offenders, the 
state of Louisiana still guards information about other parolees carefully. Apart from sex 
criminals, the state's probation and parole division refuses to give out the home addresses 
of the convicts it supervises. The concern, says Price, is that some people, such as bill 
collectors, could put the information to unwholesome purposes. "We don't want to get 
into that business," he says.</P>
<P>	In the fall of 1994, residents of Warwick, Rhode Island, a Providence suburbwere 
desperate to publicize the whereabouts of a man named Craig Price. Five years before, 
Price had admitted stabbing to death four of his Warwick neighbors. Because he was 
technically a juvenile when he committed the murders, he was sentenced to a juvenile 
detention center until age 21. Incensed by Price's crime, a Warwick police captain named 
Kevin Collins organized citizens to fight his release. "This guy had butchered four 
people," says Collins, "knowing that when he gets out at 21, he can go out and obtain a 
gun, [or] work in a day-care center."</P>
<P>	Collins decided to keep Craig Price from ever becoming anonymous. He 
recounted Price's story on radio and television shows. He sent press releases to papers 
around the country. When he heard that Price planned to move to Florida upon release, 
Collins hired an airplane to tow a sign over Miami Beach. The banner read, "Killer of 4 
Craig Price Moving Here? No Police Record!" Similar messages floated over Chicago 
and beaches in Los Angeles and New Jersey.</P>
<P>	Once Price is released, Collins says, he will not be able to tell the public where the 
killer lives. "Once he gets out there--like if he moves into your neighborhood," says 
Collins, "if I went around there knocking on doors, I think they're going to come after me 
on a civil-rights violation." Collins says the memory of the man's crimes may be enough 
to keep Price from killing again in Rhode Island. "Hey, my attitude is, he deserves to be a 
prisoner of public opinion."</P>
<H3>Exercising the Right to Know</H3>
<P> Although no Rhode Island statute would prevent Collins 
from publicizing Craig Price's address once the killer is released, doing so would be 
unwise. As a police officer, Collins could wind up in federal court under Title VII of the 
United States Code. Passed in 1964 as part of Lyndon Johnson's civil-rights legislation, 
the law allows individuals to bring civil action against government officials who conspire 
to deprive them of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts have interpreted the 
law liberally, and it is conceivable that Collins could be found to have violated Price's 
right to privacy, a protection some judges believe emanates from the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>	The state's privacy act prohibits government officials from releasing a parolee's 
medical records, or information about his drug or alcohol treatment. But no regulations 
prohibit the state from giving out his home address to citizens who ask. The privacy law 
does not bind Rhode Islanders who do not work for the government. Says James Jerue, 
chairman of the state's parole board, if Craig Price were released on parole in Rhode 
Island, any citizen could find out where he lived. Not that Jerue thinks citizens would try 
to learn. "It has never happened," he says. "No one has ever asked for a home address."</P>
<P>	Citizens have a right to know when potentially dangerous criminals are released 
into their neighborhoods. But they also have an obligation to make the effort required to 
find the information. And there are many ways to get it.</P>
<UL><LI>  In places like Rhode Island, citizens can simply ask the state for the names and 
addresses of parolees.
<LI>In states with strict privacy laws, such as New York, citizens can lobby the legislature 
for legal reform.
<LI>Individuals can ask newspapers to publish the results of every parole hearing in the 
state, as well as the names of every person arrested and convicted for a serious crime. 
Once such information becomes public, it can be spread to a wider audience on 
community bulletin boards and computer services.
<LI>Citizens' groups can apply political pressure to police departments to release the names 
and addresses of those arrested and of those being released from prison into the area.
<LI>  No citizens' group should underestimate the power of a well-placed news story to make 
police departments more accommodating to its requests. If public scrutiny helps to keep 
criminals honest, it can have the same effect on public officials.</UL>
<P>	More than anything, concerned citizens must be willing to spend time and energy 
gathering information on known criminals. Which means they must be nosy. An informed 
community is not necessarily the most private, but it will be the safest.</P>

<H3> A Felon's Perspective (sidebar)</H3>

<P>	It is clear that social-service providers cannot supply all the supervision many ex-
cons need to stay out of trouble. Neighbors can help. Lewis, a 29-year-old native of 
Washington, D.C., has spent a large portion of his life as a professional burglar. Like 
many current and former criminals, he understands that it is vital to know whether 
neighbors have criminal pasts. "People got to know," Lewis says. "If you don't know 
who's living around you, you're trusting everybody. Most of the people that I know, 
including myself, we want everybody to trust us, because once you get trusted you can do 
basically anything you want to do."</P> 
<P>	As a young man, Lewis broke into houses on his own street. Had the neighbors 
known about his criminal tendencies, he says, "it would have never happened, because 
they would have been better prepared. You'd be surprised at the people who leave 
windows open and go to work. Some people are even stupid enough to get drunk around 
you and leave their keys."</P>
<P>	At 17, Lewis was arrested for several burglaries. He was convicted and sent to 
Lorton prison, outside of Washington, first to the juvenile wing, then to the adult facility. 
By the time he got out on parole, three years later, he had not been reformed, but he had 
become considerably wiser: He stopped breaking into his neighbors' houses. "Quite a 
few neighbors" knew about his burglary convictions, he says. "Basically, it was a `we're 
going to wait and see' type of thing. I was watched and that discouraged me from 
anything."</P>
<P>	Instead, Lewis says, he looked in other neighborhoods, especially crowded parts 
of town where neighbors would not recognize him. And he always went on foot. "You 
never drive a different car to a neighborhood because everybody notices it. If people see 
that different car, they'll wait `til you get out of it." Lewis estimates he burgled nearly 50 
houses before being sent back to prison (on drug-dealing charges, not burglary).</P>
<P>	It has been several years since Lewis finished his last term in prison. He is 
married and lives in Prince George's County, Maryland. He says he has no regular job, 
but works on and off for a temporary agency. His current neighbors do not know about 
his burglary convictions, and sometimes Lewis is tempted to steal again. "The urge will 
hit when I'm broke," he says. "Sometimes when it gets a little tight with money and she 
starts bitching, you start thinking what you can do for money. And you think, `I could 
always do what I used to do.' "</P>
<P>	Although Lewis has chosen not to tell his neighbors about his criminal past, he 
does not believe other criminals should have the same choice. "Why not alert people to 
the fact that you got a known criminal in the neighborhood, you got a burglar living next 
door to you?" he asks. "The burglar who lives next door to you will get you sooner than 
you think, especially if you don't know, because he can see you every day, he sees your 
moves every day."</P>

<H3>States Take Action (sidebar)</H3>

<P>Some states require notification of local police when a released convict moves into town, 
including:</P>
<B>Alabama</B>--Those convicted of two or more felonies must register with the town sheriff 
within 24 hours of moving to a new address.</BR>
<B>Florida and Mississippi</B>--All convicted felons must register with the town sheriff within 
24 hours of moving to a new address.<BR>
<B>Minnesota</B>--Only those convicted of certain crimes must register, such as murder and 
child molestation.</BR>
<B>Missouri and Tennessee</B>--Only those on parole need register.<BR>
<B>Nevada</B>--All felons who stay for more than 48 hours must register with the police, as 
must all visiting ex-cons who come to the state five or more times within 30 days.
In a number of other states, community-notification laws apply only to sex offenders. Though 
provisions of last year's federal anti-crime legislation may ultimately require all those 
convicted of sex crimes to register with state authorities, so far only some states keep 
track of sex offenders. They include:<BR>
<B>Arkansas</B>--The staff of a facility that is releasing a habitual child molester must send 
state police the offender's new address.<BR>
<B>California</B>--Citizens will soon be able to call a state-run 900 number to receive 
information about those convicted of child molestation.<BR>
<B>Connecticut</B>--Released sex offenders must register with state law enforcement.<BR>
<B>Delaware</B>--Police may announce a sex offender's release in a newspaper advertisement.<BR>
<B>Georgia</B>--As a condition of parole, chronic sex offenders must notify the sheriff in the 
town to which they move upon release from prison.<BR>
<B>Indiana</B>--Police departments must tell any citizen who asks the names of child molesters 
who live in his or her county.<BR> 
<B>New Jersey</B>--Sex offenders must notify the police of their home addresses every three 
months, and in some cases must continue doing so for life.<BR>
<B>Oregon</B>--When a child molester goes free, the department of corrections may alert 
police, churches, convenience stores, neighbors, businesses, or other places where minors 
congregate.</BR>
<B>Washington</B>--Police may post flyers giving the names, photographs, and addresses of  
chronic sex offenders.<BR>
