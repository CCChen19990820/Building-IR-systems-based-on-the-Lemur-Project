<P>
<center><h3>The Vice Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<b>1920</b>
<p>
"Mr. President," said I, "in all these years of worry about what to do to get rid of (William Jennings) Bryan, how is it that none of you thought of making him vice president?"
<p>
<b>1924</b><br> 
<i>(This is Will Rogers' column from the June 26, 1924, edition of the </i>New York Times<i>.)
</i><p>
The following is one of the bravest statements made in a political decade:
<p>
In the entire three years of preparation by the Democratic Party to groom some man for this present crisis there has never been a mention of a man to run for Vice President.
<p>
You see, every man that wants to run at all wants to be President, and a man would take his life in his hands to go and ask one of those fellows if he was willing to run for the second place.
<p>
It's bad enough to be nominated on that ticket for President, much less Vice President.
<p>
So I just got off and held a caucus with myself and said somebody has got to be sacrificed for the sake of party harmony.  I hereby and hereon put myself in nomination, and to save some other man being humiliated by having to put me in nomination, why, I will just nominate myself.
<p>
Here is an enclosed certificate to show that this is bona fide:
<p>
I, Dr. Isador Moskowitz of 234 East Mott Street, have examined the enclosed patient, Mr. Will Rogers, and find him to be of sound mind and body (in fact, sounder in body than in mind).  This certifies that if he wants to run for Vice President I see no way of preventing it.
<p>
Signed, Isador Moskowitz, whose doctor's commission expires June 1, 1925.
<p>
So I, Will Rogers, of Claremore, Oklahoma; Hollywood, California, and 42nd Street and Broadway, New York, do hereby step right out and declare myself, not only as a receptive but an anxious candidate for the husband's position (meaning second) on the forthcoming Democratic ticket.
<p>
On first hearing this it may sound like a joke, but when I relate to you some of the qualifications which I possess, why, I think any fair-minded man will give me serious consideration.
<p>
But the trouble is there are not any fair-minded men in politics.
<p>
In the first place, they have got to nominate a farmer who understands the farmers' condition.  Well, I got two farms in Oklahoma, both mortgaged, so no man knows their condition better than I do.
<p>
He has also to be a man from the West.  Well, if a man came from 25 feet further West than I lived last year, he would have to be a fish in the Pacific Ocean.
<p>
Dawes was nominated on the Republican ticket on account of his profanity.  Now I have never tried cussin' in public, but I guess I could learn to get used to it before a crowd.
<p>
Another big reason why I should be nominated is I am not a Democrat.
<p>
Another still bigger reason why I should be nominated is I am not a Republican.
<p>
I am just progressive enough to suit the dissatisfied.
<p>
And lazy enough to be a Stand Patter.
<p>
Oil has never touched me.  The reason I know it never has is, I drilled a well on my farm in Oklahoma, and I never even touched it, much less oil touching me.
<p>
I never worked for a big corporation.
<p>
When the President can't go anywhere, why, the Vice President has to go and speak or eat for him.
<p>
Now, I could take in all the dinners, for I am a fair eater.
<p>
I could say, "I am sorry the President can't come, but he had pressing business."  Of course, I wouldn't tell the reason why he didn't come, so I am just good enough a liar to be a good Vice President.
<p>
I am not much of an after-dinner speaker, but I could learn two stories, one for dinner where ladies were present, and one for where they were not.
<p>
Of course I have no dress suit.  The Government would have to furnish me a dress suit.  If I went to a dinner in a rented one, they would mistake me for a Congressman.
<p>
I know I can hear a lot of you all say, "Yes, Will, you would make a good Vice President, but suppose something happened to the President?"
<p>
Well, I would do just like Mr. Coolidge--I would go in there and keep still and say nothing.  He is the first President to discover that what the American people want is to be let alone.
<p>
It won't take much to launch the boom.  We will wait till about tomorrow, and when some dark or even light horse is eliminated, we can take their headquarters, and buy their buttons and badges cheap.
<p>
P.S.  I was born in a Log Cabin.

<center><h3>The Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p>
<b>1920</b>
<p><ul><li>
I said: "You are not looking for a third term?"<br>
He said: "No, but all my cabinet are."<br>
Then I said: "This weegee seance (convention) out there is not so much a case of political principle as it is a case of hold your job."
<li>
Yesterday I asked President Wilson if he was going to listen to the rest of the nominating speeches over the phone.<br>
He said, "Will, do you want me to be sick again?"
<li>
I said, "I see the boy says he don't want it.  You say you don't want it.  The Republicans this year consider it an honor to be nominated, but the Democrats seem to consider it a duty."
</ul><p>
<b>1924</b>
<p><ul><li>
Chairman Hull pulled another beaut.  He read what the convention was gathered here for: "That it was to nominate a man to run for President, and take any other drastic means necessary."
<li>
Thursday they start balloting and as fast as a Presidential candidate is eliminated he has to leave the hall.  I look for the building to be empty by Thursday night.
<li>
Someone after saying fourteen of these, "the man I am about to name" finally decided to name Governor Ritchie of Maryland as a possible President.  Well, Maryland broke out and next to Smith or McAdoo it was be far the next most foolish.<br>
Only Maryland and Delaware were in on this demonstration but if they had as many votes as they have noise he would be our next vetoer.<br>
Maryland has a flag that looks as if they were advertising a Turkish cigarette.<br>
They kept marching by, trying to get the District of Columbia to join them, not knowing, of course, that the District has no votes.  But one more emblem would have broken up their Turkish flag color scheme.
<li>
Kansas had a man who is a Governor that they were "about to name" for about forty minutes before even the speaker who was nominating him could think of his name.  It was Davis.  This race will be clogged up with Davises before the end of the week.
<li>
Well, they have been balloting all day at the Democratic side show at the Garden, for that is what some misguided people think is the nominating place.<br>
The real nomination is taking place in a room at some hotel with less than six men present.<br>
And when it is known it will be as big a surprise to those delegates as it will be to you out in Arizona, and you will have just as much to do with it as they will have had.
</ul><p>
<b>1928</b>
<p><ul><li>
I knew Kansas would furnish the comedy.  What Georgia was to the Republican convention, why Kansas was to the Democrats.  Some fellow talked for two hours, nobody knew who he was.  You couldn't tell who he was talking for or against, and when he finally finished and mentioned his man we were more in the dark than before.<br>
If I had been him out of respect for my candidate after I finished my speech, I wouldn't have mentioned who it was.  No one would ever suspected and perhaps a good man's name would have been saved.
</ul><p><p>

<center><h3>A Couple Final Thoughts...</h3></center>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p>
<b>1928</b>
<p>
Well, it's been a great time.  These Democrats are a great bunch.  Just as happy as if they were working.  Houston, the police, the people, everything, was great, and so was Kansas City.  I tell you it was two fine conventions.
<p>
But I have looked at enough badges and heard enough speeches that if I ever hear another man say, "The grand old Republican party" or, "Back to the Jeffersonian principles," I will go to the gallows with a clear conscience.  I just want to go back home and go to sleep for a month.
<p>
All the speakers said "we are making history."  Well, I don't want to be disrespectful to either party, but I am just tired of seeing history being made...
<p>
Good-bye, Houston, take care of yourself.  But don't ever bid for another one of these things.  You might get it...
<p>
Good night, everybody!  I hope the next election is a draw, and they have to run it off.  This is Graham McNamee and Captain White <i>(see note below)</i> signing off, and swearing off from all conventions.
<p>
Come on airplane.  Let's show these delegates how to travel!
<p><p>
<P>

<h5>Note: Graham McNamee and Andrew White were two of the first radio announcers who covered the conventions of 1924 and 1928.  McNamee worked for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and White was one of the founders of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).</h5><P>

<center>General Thoughts on the Convention, the Delegates</center>

<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<CENTER><H3>General Convention</H3></CENTER>
<P>
1920:<UL>
<LI>I am being paid to write something funny about this Republican convention.  That's funny... All a fellow has to do to write something funny on a Republican convention is just write what happened.
<LI>When (California GOP Governor) Hiram Johnson arrived in Chicago, he bowed and started to make a speech, when someone reminded him that the demonstration was for Babe Ruth...   On Johnson's arrival he pulled the old gag which is always good: "Friends, if I am elected I will be for the common people."  Yea, bo!
<LI>I asked Pen: "What do you think of Dr. Leonard Wood?"  Boies said: "It will take more than a doctor to do this country any good the shape it's in.  What we need is a magician."
<LI>Some leading Republicans were against having a prayer this year as they didn't think it necessary.  But to add variety to an otherwise monotonous show--they decided to leave it in.
<LI>As none of the politicians present knew how to pray, they called in a professional.
</UL>
<P>
1924<UL>
<LI>As I pen these lines, I am waiting for my train to carry me to Coolidge's Follies in Cleveland.  At first I was going to say the Republican Follies, but it's not.  They have nothing to do with it.  The whole this is under the personal supervision of Mr. Coolidge.<BR>
It's a one-star show.  Now can you imagine Yaps like us going to Cleveland from all over the country when Mr. Coolidge is not going to be there himself?  Its like going to see Sir Harry Lauder's show without Sir Harry.<BR>
I am leaving tonight with New York's delegation of Unnecessary Delegates.  They preach economy, and here are hundreds of thousands of dollars being wasted to ship all these Destructive Delegates to a place to announce something that everybody in the United States knew six months ago.  He could have been nominated by post card.  Why didn't he suggest taking this money they are spending to tell him he is nominated and give it to the poor in each State?  Don't say there is no poor.  There must be some Democrats in every State.
<LI>(William Jennings) Bryan and I had no sooner got in the hall than they commenced to pray.  The preacher started reading his prayer, which was new to me.  Where I come from if a man can't think of anything to pray about offhand, why, there is no need of him praying.  If they couldn't find a Republican that knew how to pray they should have called in a Democrat.  They are all praying this year.
<LI>Take Abraham Lincoln.  A new angle on the reason that his memory is honored through eternity is (according to every speaker that was allowed to open his mouth at this convention) that "Lincoln was a member of the Republican Party."  Had Lincoln been unfortunate enough to have been a member of the Progressives and done the same thing he did, why, a Republican convention would never have heard of him...  Of course to most of you who never attended a Republican convention, why, Lincoln's fame was based on a remark (while a member of the Republican Party), consisting of eleven words.  That's all.  Some historians have since added two other lines, but in the original Lincoln saying there were only these eleven words.  Both political parties are based on it: "You can fool most of the delegates all of the time." ...  That's enough: you don't need to fool only a comfortable majority.
</UL>
<P>
1928<UL>
<LI>They had a time seating the Texas delegation, as there was no law in Texas to apply to a Republican primary.  Texas never thought they would come to a point where there would ever be any Republicans there.  They also have no laws against the shooting out of season of reindeer or musk ox.
<LI>The (GOP) convention opened with a prayer, a very fervent prayer that (Democrat) Al Smith be not nominated (in the Democratic convention).  It was a keynote prayer, if the Lord can see his way clear to bless the Republican Party the way it's been carrying on, then the rest of us ought to even get it without asking for it.
<LI>They just played the National Anthem, and when they finished (Senator) Fess asked the band leader to play something else "while the Chairman was trying to think of something to say."  They are still playing.
<LI>There is nothing to do here when a speaker comes on.  You have to listen to him...
<LI>The convention met last night and then adjourned in five minutes.  That was the most successful convention the people of the country have ever enjoyed.  They met again at 10 this morning, but unfortunately didn't adjourn.  It looked like they had, but they hadn't.
<LI>Reed Smoot from Salt Lake read what sounded like a cross between a financial report and a World Almanac.  He spoke heartily of prosperity.  But our national deficit was still thirty billion when he finished...  The crowd couldn't hear him and shouted for him to speak louder.  Then when he did speak louder and they did hear him why they got sorer than a boil and wanted him to speak low again...  He brought up Nicaragua but he left the marines down there.  He said that he would protect American lives down there, even if we had to send some there to protect.


<LI>They stopped everyone in the house from smoking.  The Republicans are coming out against cigarettes and tobacco.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The Delegates</H3></CENTER>
<P>
1920<UL>
<LI>The California delegation took a carload of California poppies to scatter (at the Republican convention) in Chicago.  They figure on catching the dope fiend vote which is very large this year...  Suppose the Kentucky delegation will bring some tobacco leaves and try and land the nicotine vote.
<LI>I asked Pen: "How can you tell who bought delegates?  He said: "That's easy, the ones who didn't buy any are the ones who haven't got any."
<LI>I asked Pen: "How does it come the New York delegates are practically uninstructed."  Boies remarked to me: "You can't instruct a New Yorker, he knows it all."
<LI>I said: "What makes the delegates change?  Don't they stay with their man?"  Pen said: "The delegates vote the way their people told them the first ballot.  But after that they sell to the highest bidder."  I said: "But that's not honest, is it?"  Pen said: "No, just politics."
</UL>
1924<UL>
<LI>If these Delegates vote the way they were instructed to vote Back Home they will be the first politicians that ever did what the people told them to do.  And if they do, this will be the first convention in the History of the World where the Man won who had the most votes to start in with.

<p>
1920
<ul><li>Imagine a Congress that squanders $670,000,000 to make one airship trying to 
investigate where some candidate spent a few thousand.
</ul>
<p>
1924
<ul>
<li>As for drafting the platform, that's just a lot of Apple Sauce.  Why I bet you there
is not a Republican or Democrat office-holder today that can tell you one Plank in the 
last Election Platform without looking over the minutes.  These Misled Delegates that 
journey to Cleveland will have just as much chance of helping to frame that platform as a Bow-
Legged girl would have at our Stage Door.  Mr. Coolidge framed that Platform.  I doubt if
 Lodge even has been allowed to see it...
<li>
P.S. Since I arrived in New York, they read a platform.<br>
P.S. It is now six hours later and everybody has forgotten what the platform was.<br>
P.S. (third time) Before they forgot it, they nominated Coolidge.  I'm telling you this 
as a scoop on the other papers.
</ul>
1928
<ul><LI>A keynote speech is press notices for the Republican Party, written by its own 
members.
 Here are just a few things that I bet you didn't know the Republicans were responsible
 for--radio, telephones, baths, automobiles, savings accounts, enforcement, workmen 
living in houses and a living wage for Senators...  The Democrats had brought on war, pestilence,
 debts, disease, boll weevil, gold teeth, need of farm relief, suspenders, floods, and
 famines...<br>He told of so much money that we had saved, that I think if he had talked
 another hour he would have paid us a dividend...<br>When he got to (outgoing GOP president)
 Coolidge, I thought sure he was referring to "Our Saviour" till they told me, "no, it
 was Coolidge."  The way he rated 'em was Coolidge, the Lord and then Lincoln.

<center><h3>The Vice-Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
<p>
<p>
1920
<ul><li>I see where they are cutting a lot of delegates down to half a vote.  Guess they will let the half-a-vote delegates nominate the vice-president.
</ul>
1924
<ul><li>Of course, lots of people are banking on the excitement coming from the nomination of the Vice President.  Why Mr. Coolidge has had him picked out months ago, ever since Congress overrode his first Veto.  Some say it is Lowden.  But I don't think they can ever persuade him that he can never do any better.

<li>Imagine the Republicans worrying over who they will pick for a Vice President.  Just think of the Poor Democrats.  They are worrying who to pick for a President.  If they can get a good man for President they would be willing to let the Vice Presidency go.
<li>
This is the first Vice Presidential convention ever held in the history of politics...  I suppose four years from now they will hold a National Convention to nominate the Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.
<li>
All my life I have been longing to attend a convention and see the excitement and hear the shouts.  Now, when I do get a chance I draw this one...
<li>
But we are all just victims of circumstances.  Who would have ever thought that the day would come when people would be going to a convention just to nominate a Vice President.
<li>
Why at the last Republican Convention they were days nominating Mr. Harding and just as they were putting on their hats to leave, someone happened to think, "Why, we haven't nominated a Vice President.  That's customary is it not?"  So someone who happened to have read of the Boston police strike suggested Mr. Coolidge, so they nominated him that minute, and the others went home to read the next day who he was.
<li>
In the old days it was not, "Who will we nominate for Vice President?"  It was "Who can we get to take the thing?"...
<li>
They say they won't nominate one of the Old Guard for Vice President, they want new faces.  Tomorrow at the convention, I am going to put into nomination Fanny Brice.  Fanny has the newest face I know of; she just had it overhauled this year.
<li>
The Republican Vice Presidential conscription convention opened at 11 o'clock this morning with an array of badges that was deafening.  I had the thrill of my entire life.  I entered the convention press stand with William Jennings Bryan.  We were the only two aliens in the entire hall--he the solitary Democrat and I the sole remaining Progressive Bull Moose.  Both of us entered, not to jeer, but to be instructed.  We came out three hours later more ignorant than when we went in.
<li>
My candidate has come.  He just got in this morning and phoned me.  I told you I would deliver him.  It's Will Hays.  I started him Monday for President, but he has degenerated down now till Vice President is about all I have for him.  He can hold both jobs, preside over the Senate and Hollywood both.  In fact, I think we should move the studios from Hollywood to Washington in exchange for the Senate and Congress.  I bet you the City of Washington would trade in a minute.  But I would hate to be the one to suggest it to Hollywood.
<li>
They held off choosing a Vice President until the finish of the show.  This is the first time a Vice Presidential nomination has been strong enough to hold an audience till the finish.
<li>
It has been rumored around town today that I left to prevent my being nominated as Vice President.  I wish to state that that was exactly the case.
</ul>
1928
<ul><li>The whole show has degenerated into nothing but a dog fight for Vice President...  Men who two days ago wouldn't even speak to a Vice President are now trying to get to be one...  They have weeded the Vice Presidential candidates down to just the following: ninety-six Senators, 435 Congressmen, and forty-seven Governors.  (Forty-eight Governors, I should have said; Oklahoma has been admitted (to the Union).)
</ul><P>

<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
"Cowboy humorist" and star of stage and screen Will Rogers was commissioned to write 
about the 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1932 national political conventions, a job he thoroughly
enjoyed as these quadrennial politicalfests provided ample fodder for a humorist.  ABIC is pleased
 to offer just a sampling of Rogers' observations during the 1996 convention season.
  You'll note that in many cases things haven't changed much.  But in some cases 
things have changed so much that his statements offer even more ironic humor.
<P>
Each day we'll focus on a different aspect of the convention.  And as Rogers covered both
 the Democratic and Republican conventions, be sure to come back in two weeks and see 
what he had to say about the Democrats!

<center><h3>The Presidential Nomination</h3></center>
<p>
1920
<ul><li>A week ago the Republicans thought they could win with anybody.  Now they can't find anybody they think they can win with.
<li>
I said: "This fellow Sproul you are for--nobody knows anything about him."  Pen said: "That's just what makes it so hard to nominate those other Republican candidates; people know too much about them."
<li>
(During the voting for the presidential nominee) Boies said: "I might just as well sent Connie Mack (grandfather of current Sen. Connie Mack, R-FL) out there.  He couldn't a finished any further back."
<li>
I said: "Do you think Johnson will start a third party?"  Boies said: "If he does this will be the most successful convention the Democrats ever held."
</ul><p>
1924
<ul><li>Things must be in a pretty bad way in the Republican Party when they have only Two Men who think they are good enough to run.  Why, in the Democratic Party they have a Thousand who think they are good enough.  According to that, they Democrats must have the most Able Party.
<li>
Lots of people can't understand the popularity that Mr. Coolidge is deservedly enjoying all over the country at the present time.  I can tell you.  It started the minute he opposed Congress and the Senate.  The People said: "If he is against Congress he must be right."  It was the surest fire political move anyone ever had a chance to make.  If he agreed with Congress he would have been as dead as they are today.
</ul><p>

<center><h3>Some Final Thoughts</h3></center>
<p>
1924
<ul><li>Well, so long readers--both of you.  Will meet you at the Democratic convention again.  What it lacks in class, in comparison to the Republican one, why, they will make up in noise.

<li>Leave your watches and jewelry at home.  Bring nothing but your alternates.  It's a cinch you can't lose them.
</ul>
1928
<ul><li>Wow!  She is all over.  Hoover and Curtis...  The Republican Party owed (Curtis) something, but I didn't think they would be so low down as to pay him that way.  He used to be floor-walker of the Republican Party on the Senate floor.  Now he will be time-keeper.
<li>
Another preacher prayed this morning and had to read his prayer.  There hasn't been a one that could make an impromptu prayer...  This one was a Methodist, and he wanted us "to look to the hills for wisdom," and here we went and nominated Charley Curtis from the plains of Kansas, where a five-foot ash heap would constitute a precipice...
<li>
This preacher prayed for Plymouth Rock.  Lord, it's Boulder Dam we are after, now!  There is no appropriation goes with Plymouth Rock.
<li>
I hate to say it, but the women that spoke were all terrible.  Well, they were pretty near as bad as the men, and that will give you an idea how bad they were.
</ul>
1932
<ul><li>See you at the Democrats, where they will let anybody nominate everybody.
</ul><p>

Dear Readers:
<p>
Welcome to Capital Letters!  Take Dear Abby, Ann Landers, Hints from Heloise and Capital Gang, roll them all into one and what do you have?  <b>CAPITAL LETTERS</b>: an advice column for the politically interested but inexperienced and organizationally challenged.  Send us your political questions, queries, ideas via <a href="/abic/cl-emailer.html">e-mail</a> and we'll pick the two or three each week to answer on-line.  
<p>
Maybe you'd love to know:
<ul>
<li>how to get your congressman to pay more attention to your views;
<li>how to take control of your local school board;
<li>how to organize your neighbors into a political force on a specific cause or issue;
<li>how to find out more about your Senator's activities in Washington--things he or she 	   might not want you to know;
<li>how to get started running for office;
<li>how to build a fire under your local media and change the political climate of your area
</ul><p>
We welcome the questions -- and we'll do our best to sift through and answer the ones that have the most universal application (or are the most interesting).
<p>
Look for new letters every Monday -- and if we receive enough, we'll change them more often.
<p>
The goal?  To help put the American people back in charge of their government at every level.  We will do our best to give you the information and the tools to help you do exactly that.

<h2>Advice for Health Charity Donors</h2>

By James T. Bennett and Thomas J. DiLorenzo 
<P>
Americans give some $10 billion annually to over 2,000 health
charities. How can donors determine if a charity is using contributions
efficiently and is running effective programs, and is thus worthy
of support?
<P>
Donors should recognize that there may be a wide disparity between
what a health charity says about its activities and what it actually
does. Before you contribute, consider the following:
<UL>
<LI><I>Health Advice</I>. Some advice offered by health charities
is so simplistic (e.g., &quot;watch your diet,&quot; &quot;get
plenty of exercise&quot;) that it is worthless. Worse, advice
may be contradictory, misleading, or based on weak evidence.
<LI><I>Professional Education</I>. Some health charities spend
heavily on educating health professionals about new medical advances,
diagnostic techniques, and treatments. But other well-paid professionals
(e.g., accountants, lawyers, college professors) attend conferences
and subscribe to professional journals at their own expense.
<LI><I>Research</I>. Nearly all disease research is paid for through
federal taxes. Health charities that say they fund research often
only provide money to help researchers apply for federal grants.
<LI><I>Patient and Community Services</I>. Of 39 health charities
examined in a 1990 report by the National Health Council (a nonprofit
association of health charities), 14 spent nothing on patient
services, and another 11 spent less than $1 million each. Twenty-three
of the 39 spent a total of just over $1 billion on community services
(e.g., screening for diseases, support for rehabilitation programs).
<LI><I>Real Estate and other Assets</I>. Some health charities
hold millions of dollars in cash, stocks, bonds, certificates
of deposit, land, buildings, and automobiles. Obviously, such
holdings mean fewer funds for program services.
</UL>

<P>
Donors should carefully review a health charity's annual report
and audited financial statement before making any contribution.
These show the amount the charity spends on its programs. Other
questions that donors should seek answers to include:
<UL>
<LI>Does the charity provide services at the lowest possible cost?
<LI>Does the charity use its funds for the purposes described
in its fund-raising appeals?
<LI>Do those in greatest need benefit most from the charity's
programs?
<LI>Could better results be achieved by redirecting resources
to other activities, e.g., services for disease victims?
</UL>

<P>
An in-depth look at these issues can be found in our book, <I>Unhealthy
Charities: Hazardous to Your Health and Wealth</I> (New York:
Basic Books, 1994).

<TITLE>MacArthur's Genius Awards: Catharine Stimpson, Director-- CRC</TITLE>

<BR>
<I>CATHARINE STIMPSON, 
<P>DIRECTOR, MACARTHUR FELLOWS PROGRAM</I>
<P>
<P>Catharine Stimpson's story is typical of many 
left-wing women of her generation.  Born in 1936, she became 
a radical activist in the `60s. But as the era ended and as she 
has aged, her sights turned from the streets to the schools. 
Rising up the academic and philanthropic ladder, Stimpson 
has never abandoned her feminism or her animus toward 
conservatives.
<P>Stimpson joined the English department of Barnard 
College in 1963, where she remained until 1980, when 
she joined the English Department at Rutgers University.  In 
the mid-1980s, she became dean of the Rutgers graduate 
school, where she stayed until her appointment to the 
MacArthur Foundation in 1994.  She retains a house in Staten 
Island, New York, and is officially on leave from Rutgers.
<P>Stimpson's early writings are quite militant.  In a 
1974 essay, for example, she charged that the plight of women 
in America was analogous to that of blacks, because &quot;what 
the economy gives both women and blacks are menial 
labor, low pay, and few promotions.&quot;  She added that &quot;blacks 
and women also live in the wasteland of American 
sexuality&quot; because &quot;white men, convinced of the holy primacy 
of sperm, yet guilty about using it, angry at the loss of the 
cozy sanctuary of the womb and the privilege of childhood, 
have made their sex a claim to power and then used their 
power to claim control of sex.  In fact and fantasy, they 
have violently segregated black men and white women.&quot;
<P>In 1976, Stimpson, who has never married, moved in 
with another woman and  became what she called &quot;father/mother&quot; 
 and &quot;parenter&quot; to four children, none her own.  She 
also began work on her only novel, <I>Class Notes </I>(1979).  
The work describes a woman who, like Stimpson, grew up in 
a small town in the state of Washington in the late 1940s 
and 1950s.  Periodically Harriet Springer, Stimpson's 
heroine, confronts men who drink excessively, beat her, and 
warn her of the dangers of Communism and the United Nations. 
 Stimpson's heroine escapes this male torment by 
entering an effete Eastern women's college where she learns 
the delights of lesbian love. 
<P>Stimpson became a national figure after she became 
a dean at Rutgers.  She generally sided with the left, 
though she has always opposed speech codes and has 
attacked feminists who call for censorship.  As Cathy Young 
reported in <I>Heterodoxy</I>, Stimpson has said her ultimate 
goal was for &quot;a mutiracial, multicultural, multispecied world.&quot; 
<P>Stimpson's views towards conservatives are best 
expressed in her 1987 essay &quot;Nancy Reagan Wears a Hat: 
 Feminism and Its Cultural Consensus.&quot;  &quot;Right-wing 
conservatism could also appeal to fears,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to 
the fears of women that they would be vulnerable and 
helpless if men did not protect them economically; to the fears 
of men that they would be vulnerable and helpless if 
women did not submit to them; and to the fears of both men 
and women that the world would be wholly cruel, 
wholly pitiless, wholly formless, if it had neither havening 
homes nor nurturing mother figures.&quot;
<P>Stimpson has denied she has that much influence 
over who becomes a MacArthur Fellow. But, in a 1994 
interview with the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> she said that as 
program director, &quot;one of my responsibilities is to make sure 
activists are as much represented as academics.&quot;

<P>
MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN,  1990 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of 
the Children's Defense Fund, (CDF) is the leading 
champion of the welfare state in the U.S.  In earlier years, she led 
the effort to make the welfare state grow; today, her efforts 
are devoted to prolonging Great Society programs as long 
as possible.
<P>As late as 1990, Edelman presented herself as 
an unreconstructed liberal, writing inflammatory articles 
with titles like &quot;Why America May Go to Hell&quot; if 
welfare programs did not grow.  But after winning her 
MacArthur Fellowship, she reformulated her strategy, presenting 
herself as an &quot;independent&quot; who combined 
conservative-sounding approaches to raising children with 
big-government liberalism.  In 1992, for example, she published 
<I>The Measure of Our Success</I>, a bestseller which 
combined homilies about childrearing with pleas for making 
the welfare state bigger.  But in the same year, she told 
the readers of <I>Challenge</I>, a business magazine, that 
families could only be saved by national health insurance, 
national child support insurance, fully-funded Head Start,  and 
a new federal program for &quot;intensive family 
preservation services.&quot;
<P>Since Hillary Rodham Clinton had served as CDF chairman until her husband began his presidential 
campaign, many observers expected that she would be a 
key adviser to the Clinton Administration.  The first part 
of 1993 sparked a flurry of profiles about 
Edelman;<I> Harper's Bazaar</I> even titled their profile of her &quot;Saint Marian.&quot;  
But other observers were more skeptical.  <I>The New 
Republic'</I>s Mickey Kaus, for example, said that Edelman's view 
that &quot;welfare should be expanded into a guaranteed income 
is a deadweight political loser.  How many politicians 
could win an election today arguing that the solution to 
the problems of South-Central Los Angeles is to put 
everyone on the dole?&quot;  <I>Fortune</I>'s Daniel Seligman added that 
&quot;the spending called for by CDF would make matters 
worse, not better,&quot; since more welfare might increase the 
number of single-parent households.
<P>With the Republican takeover of Congress and 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's retreat from the political 
arena, Edelman's influence has substantially diminished. 
She continues to critique the Republicans, however; in a 
1995 interview with the leftist magazine <I>Southern 
Exposure</I>, she condemned the Contract with America as &quot;a 
Trojan horse for a relentless assault on children's programs 
that leaves non-needy  constituencies virtually untouched.  
Not only is it morally wrong, it is economically wrong.&quot;</ul>
<P>
<a name="ehrlich"></a>
<P><I>PAUL EHRLICH, 1990 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich has long been the 
leading doomsayer among environmentalists.  A prolific writer, 
he has consistently predicted ecological disasters which 
have never happened.  In <I>The Population 
Bomb</I> (1968; revised, 1971), Ehrlich predicted  that America in 1984 would 
have food shortages so severe that steak would be $12 a pound, 
 the U.S. unemployment rate would be 27 percent, and 
India would be an anarchy because of nationwide food riots.  
In 1973, Ehrlich predicted that by 1990, 65 million 
Americans would suffer from starvationabout the same number 
of Americans who were overweight in that year.
<P>Ehrlich's most famous prediction was a bet he made 
in 1980 with economist Julian Simon, in which he 
predicted that the prices of thirteen minerals would rise by 1990 
as their supplies became exhausted.  Ehrlich lost that 
bet, because 11 of the 13 minerals fell in price, and the 
constant dollar price of six of the minerals (including silver, 
platinum, and tin) dropped by over 50 percent.
<P>Accompanying Ehrlich's gloomy predictions are 
calls for draconian increases in government in order to 
forestall a pending ecological apocalypse.  In <I>How to Be a 
Survivor </I>(1971), Ehrlich and Richard L. Hartman called for 
the establishment of a federal Department of Population 
and Environment which would combine the government's 
environmental agencies, the Interior Department, and 
the Census Bureau and &quot;should, of course, have more 
power over the private sector and state and local governments 
than all of these (other agencies) combined.&quot;  They also 
endorsed FDR brain-truster Rexford G. Tugwell `s efforts to 
replace the Constitution with a new version that would include 
a &quot;national regulator&quot; who would have veto power over 
the activities of all corporations and nonprofits in the U.S.
<P>In a June 1995 interview with the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I>, Ehrlich admitted that he had made mistakes in his 
previous predictions, but that most of them would come true in 
the near future.  Ehrlich also continues to be rewarded 
by nonprofits; he was one of the first recipients of the 
Heinz prize, a smaller-scale version of the MacArthur 
Fellowships.
</ul><P>
<a name="lovins"></a>
<P><I>AMORY LOVINS, 1993 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>Amory Lovins was one of the more important ecologists 
of the 1970s.  His day of fame came in 1976, when he 
published an article in<I> Foreign Affairs</I> calling for the U.S. to follow 
a &quot;soft energy path&quot; of reliance on the sun and the wind 
instead of the &quot;hard energy path&quot; of using oil, coal, and 
nuclear power.  Lovins's article was wildly controversial, and led 
to Lovins being invited to the White House, testifying 
before Congress, and being hired as a consultant by many 
agencies devoted to energy, both in the U.S. and abroad.  So 
voluminous was the response to Lovins' article that in 1979 
Lovins produced <I>The Energy Controversy</I>, a 409-page book 
in which he responded to thirteen of his critics.
<P>But in the 1980s, falling oil prices made Lovins an 
anachronism.  He briefly tried to capture the limelight with 
<I>The First Nuclear World War (</I>1983), in which he and 
Patrick O'Heffernan predicted that nuclear weapons would 
explode in Pakistan, Iran, and southern California by 1988.  
Lovins and O'Heffernan even predicted that U.S. troops would be 
in Iraqto defend Saddam Hussein against 
nuclear-armed Iranians. 
<P>In 1982, Lovins founded the Rocky Mountain 
Institute, devoted to promoting energy conservation policies.  A 
1993 article in <I>The Economist</I> noted that the institute's 
power sources included solar cells and a bull terrier named 
Nanuq the Beastoid, whom Lovins claimed was a 50-watt 
energy source, &quot;but sometimes we throw things for her and get 
her up to 100 watts.&quot;  What the hound did to generate power 
was not made clear.
<P>Lovins is still an advocate of larger government; in a 
1992 article in <I>Foreign Affairs</I>, he and Joseph L. Romm called 
for the Clinton Administration to implement massive 
subsidies for energy conservation, a national industrial policy, 
worker training programs, and subsidies to rebuild America's 
infrastructure.
</ul><P>
<a name="schneider"></a>
<P><I>STEPHEN SCHNEIDER, 1994 FELLOW</I>
<P>
<ul>A climatologist, Schneider is one of the nation's 
leading advocates of the theory of &quot;global warming,&quot; the notion 
that the earth is getting progressively warmer due to the 
dissemination of &quot;greenhouse gases.&quot;  But as author Ronald 
Bailey notes in <I>Eco-Scam,</I> Schneider's first book, 
<I>The Genesis Strategy</I> (1976) was devoted to the idea that the earth 
was getting progressively colder.  To fight this alleged 
&quot;global cooling,&quot;  Schneider proposed massive income 
redistribution, strict regulations on the introduction of new 
technologies, and government-subsidized environmental 
programs which would teach the public to &quot;question present 
value systems and adopt a new political consciousness.&quot;
<P>After switching his position to favor global warming, Schneider admitted to author Jonathan Schell that in order 
to save the planet, scientists should suspend any doubts 
they may have about the possibility of ecological disaster.  
&quot;To capture the public's imagination,&quot; Schneider said, 
&quot;entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up 
scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and 
make little mention of any doubts we might have.&quot;
<P>Long associated with the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research, Schneider recently joined Stanford 
University, where he is associated with fellow doomster 
Paul Ehrlich. 
</ul>
<P>
<a name="wolfe"></a>
<P><I>SIDNEY WOLFE, 1990 FELLOW</I>
<P><ul>Since 1971, Sidney Wolfe has headed the Health 
Research Group, the medical branch of Ralph Nader's 
nonprofit Public Citizen.  But throughout his career, as Milton 
Copulos charged in a 1985 critique in 
<I>Reason</I>, there have been &quot;concerns that Wolfe is selective in his use of facts, that 
he frequently overemphasizes the negative aspects of 
evidence, and that he often exaggerates the dangers he alleges 
are present.&quot;
<P>As early as 1976, for example, Wolfe led a 
successful effort to ban Red Dye No. 2, an alleged carcinogen, 
even though the research conducted by the Food and Drug 
Administration was inconclusive and badly managed.  
Wolfe also led a successful effort (aided by a class-action 
lawsuit) to persuade Merrell Dow to withdraw Benedictin, a 
drug given to pregnant women to prevent nausea, even though 
the drug had safely been given to women for thirty years.
<P>In his career, Wolfe has made curious allies .. He 
has worked with Scientologists to try to ban the use of Prozac, 
an alliance that led the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I> to dub Wolfe &quot;L. Ron Nader.&quot;  Wolfe's critics also accuse the Health 
Research Group of selling &quot;how-to-sue&quot; kits to trial lawyers for 
$750, filled with studies needed to launch a class-action 
lawsuit. Wolfe claims that he only sells these kits &quot;when there's 
an unequivocal relationship between the product and causes 
of (injury or) death&quot;, and that contributions from trial 
lawyers make up less than one percent of Public Citizen's $8 
million budget.  
<P>As CRC Visiting Fellow Tom Holt notes in his 
monograph <I>The Rise of the Nanny State</I>, Wolfe has been 
an advocate of a single-payer Canadian-style health care 
plan since 1970. &quot;Wolfe often asserts, without evidence, that 
as much as half the money spent on health care is wasted,&quot; 
Holt reports.<BR>

<center><h2>Inside the Ford Foundation's Plan to Split Apart America </h2>
<h3>by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle</h3></center>
<p>
The roots of the Ford Foundation's support for Hispanic political activism can be traced to the late McGeorge
Bundy, National Security Adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and president of the Ford Foundation from 1966 to 1979.  A high-minded
Boston Brahmin eager to turn from badly advising Lyndon Johnson
on Vietnam war policy to establishing domestic social priorities,
Bundy concentrated his efforts at Ford on improving American education
and on ending racial discrimination. 
<P>
&quot;He came to the foundation determined
to put as much distance as possible between himself and the horror
in the Far East,&quot; Waldemar Neilsen said in his book <I>The
Golden Donors</I>, &quot;to achieve high visibility for himself
as a liberal domestic reformer.&quot; Bundy made a dramatic series
of grants to change the direction of the foundation quickly. He
funded direct action protests by community groups, voter registration
drives, and even some outreach programs to urban street gangs.
With the Ford Foundation on their side beneficiaries quickly becme
&quot;more strident in their demands and more involved in local
politics,&quot; according to Neilsen. Congressman Wright Patman
went to the House floor to ask, &quot;Does the Ford Foundation
have a grandiose design to bring vast political, economic, and
social changes to the nation?&quot; The answer was yes. What Neilsen
called Bundy's &quot;sneering contempt&quot; during congressional
hearings led Patman to place legal prohibitions on &quot;political
and propagandistic grants&quot; and restrictions on voter registration
projects.
<P>&quot;Henry Ford II was close to 'going crazy'
with Bundy's 'progressive' _ and to his mind _  wastrel politics,&quot;
writes Georgie Anne Geyer in her new book <I>Americans No More
</I>[see review by Robert Huberty on page 8]. &quot;Ford dealers
across the country were bitterly complaining to him that Bundy's
policies were ruining their businesses: Thousands of Americans
were refusing to buy Fords.&quot;
<P>
As I first  pointed out in my book, <I>Out
Of The Barrio</I> (NY: Basic Books, 1991) Ford repeated  a pattern
characteristic of the political trends of the 1960s and 70s and
Bundy's liberalism played straight into the hands of ethnic activists.
They exploited liberalism's well-meaning and expansive social
concerns by advancing an aggressive political agenda undermining
America's tradition of equal opportunity.  The new Hispanic organizations
were products of  the Ford Foundation and it must bear a heavy
burden of responsibility for their actions. The Ford Foundation
was the leading funder of Hispanic advocacy groups.
<P>
Bundy's interest in Hispanic politics arose
from a 1968 study that the Ford Foundation commissioned on Hispanics
in America.  This was originally an internal document that would
guide the foundation and help direct its agenda and grantmaking
to Hispanics. 
<P>
The report concluded that Mexican Americans
were disorganized and fragmented and in need of a national organization
to serve their social, economic and political needs.  Siobhan
Oppenheimer Nicolau, a former Ford Foundation program officer
who guided Ford's early decisions to fund Hispanic organizations,
stated in 1990 that foundation officials thought Mexican Americans
were unable to create and sustain a network of viable institutions.
 Why?  &quot;They lacked the strong network of religious institutions
that had nurtured black leadership.  They lacked visibility outside
the Southwest, and they lacked a history of slavery, a powerful
tool that had galvanized white guilt and support for the black
civil rights movement.&quot;
<P>
To this day Ford officials use the same rhetoric.
Susan Vail Berresford, current president of the Ford Foundation,
wrote in the October 14, 1996 <I>National Review</I>, &quot;Our
grants to Hispanic-led groups to strengthen their communities
and improve their level of participation in American society hardly
constitute an &quot;attack on American democracy.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="2">
<P>
<B>Present at the Creation</B>
<P>
Relying on these conclusions, the Ford Foundation decided 
to create two major Hispanic organizations.  In 1968 it established
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF)
which was intended to use lawsuits, and courtroom and legislative
 maneuvering to promote public policy. In fact, the organization
was a creature of the Ford Foundation, and as she wrote in response
to Berresford in the same issue of <I>National Review</I>, &quot;would
not exist without foundation funding.&quot;
<P>
In 1968, too,  Ford funded the Southwest
Council of La Raza as an organization coordinating other organizations
-- which later became the National Council of La Raza, described
as &quot;the Latino equivalent of the Urban League.&quot;
<P>
It was a still a creature of the Ford Foundation,
dependent on annual grants from New York City and unrepresentative
of Hispanic Americans.
<P>
In the nearly three decades since their establishment,
these organizations, MALDEF in particular, have played an enormous
role in shaping public policy toward Hispanics, on everything
from immigration to education to voting laws.  In 1975 MALDEF
was instrumental in amending the 1965 Voting Rights Act to force
jurisdictions with significant numbers of voters identified as
Hispanic to receive voting materials in Spanish.  Today, more
than 270 jurisdictions are affected by this requirement.  Under
the act, jurisdictions in Michigan and elsewhere are required
to print Spanish language ballots at considerable cost even though
practically no one uses them.
<P>
From 1968 to 1975, MALDEF pushed through bilingual
education programs and requirements across the country.  They
have trapped Hispanic students in what are essentially Spanish-language
maintenance and development programs.  A September 1996 poll of
Hispanic parents by the Center for Equal Opportunity shows that
the vast majority of Hispanics don't agree with groups like MALDEF
on bilingual education. [see box on p.4] This national survey
found that 63 percent of Hispanic parents say they want their
children to learn English as quickly as possible. Only 16.9% want
Spanish taught first. Over 80 percent want their children's academic
courses to be taught in English and not Spanish.  But the bilingual
education programs favored by MALDEF do just the opposite.  They
teach schoolchildren almost exclusively in Spanish throughout
grade school and sometimes through high school.
<P>
The Ford Foundation remains the largest single
source of funding for MALDEF and NCLR.  According to Geyer, NCLR
in 1989 received $590,000 from Ford, a major share of its $3.5
million budget that year.  In 1991 it received $1.25 million from
Ford.  From 1968 to 1990 Ford gave more than $9.6 million to NCLR
and $14.2 million to MALDEF.  Susan Vail Berresford, the Ford
Foundation's current president, was a keynote speaker at NCLR's
annual conference in Denver this past July.  She was given NCLR's
President's Award for her leadership and commitment to NCLR. 
With ten thousand participants, this was NCLR's largest conference,
and it featured sessions on issues like: How to defend affirmative
action. 
<P>
Yet, NCLR's growth has blunted some of its
ideological edge, at least when it comes to raising money, and
this has led to tensions within the organization.  Funding for
the Denver conference, which cost $1.2 million, left some activists
fuming.  Specifically, critics complained that NCLR should not
have accepted a $25,000 sponsorship fee from the Golden, Colorado-based
Coors Brewing Company.  Some conservative members of the Coors
family have supported proposals to make English the official language
of the United States and have opposed racial preference policies.
<P>
NCLR, however, has learned the political and
financial ropes, and it knows how to run its organization and
agenda along several tracks.  As Raul Yzaguirre, president of
NCLR -- and past Chairman of Independent Sector, a group founded
by Common Cause's John Gardner to promote networking for social
change among non-profits -- explained to a reporter for the <I>Denver
Post</I>:  &quot;We learned how to do things right.&quot; Yzaguirre
added. &quot;We analyzed public policy, earned a reputation the
hard way, as reasonable, hard&#173;minded, objective [people].
Developing friends on [Capitol] Hill, then moving on to new areas.&quot;
Yzaguirre denies that NCLR's competence in Washington lobbying
has put it out of touch with the average Hispanic.  He told the
<I>Post</I>,  &quot;Check the polls, on every issue -&#173; civil
rights, education, housing, equal access -&#173; we [Hispanics]
are together.&quot; 
<P>
But polling data shows that Hispanics are not united behind NCLR positions.
Nevertheless, Yzaguirre is among the organizers for a Columbus Day protest march in Washington
DC -- endorsed by the U.S. Catholic Conference, Congressional Hispanic
Caucus, and other organizations -- whose leader, Los Angeles activist
Juan Jose Guiterrez told <I>The Washington Post</I>, &quot;To
the best of my knowledge, the great majority of the American public
does not support a fascist police state.&quot;
<p>
Despite their ability to stage media events,
MALDEF, NCLR, and other Hispanic advocacy organizations funded
by the Ford Foundation are not directly accountable to the community
whose interests they purport to represent.  The Hispanic community
does not elect the members, officers, or board of these organizations,
most of which pursue their objectives with little public scrutiny.
 Because they are not membership organizations dependent on individual
contributions from the community at large, few Mexican Americans
can name these groups.  Their leaders are unknown despite their
influence on public policy affecting Hispanics.  The Hispanic
community does not control the funding of these groups and, most
importantly, it has virtually no say in the agenda they choose
to promote.  The Ford Foundation and other grantmakers have freed
these organizations from the need to be accountable to the communities
they are supposed to represent.  And they have created a cadre
of ethnic power brokers instead of identifying legitimate representatives
from the Hispanic community.
<P>
These groups believe they are on the cutting
edge of social change.  But the future they envision is one in
which Hispanics become wards of government permanently entitled
to public benefits because of their ethnicity.  Most  Hispanics,
like other groups before them, would choose to become part of
the mainstream. Instead, these groups speak of &quot;empowering&quot;
Hispanics by defining them as members of a protected class. They
want to empower Hispanic children by winning court battles that
will require them to be taught in Spanish for a society where
the best jobs go to those who speak, read, and write English well.
 They insist that the fortunes of middle&#173;class Hispanics
must be determined by the political battles over the most disadvantaged
Hispanics, making the former hostage to the latter.  Only the
lobbyists and activists who broker the policies of the welfare
state benefit from such strategies.
<P>
With $7.5 billion in assets, you would think
the Ford Foundation would want to do something other than fund
organizations intent on dividing Americans along racial and ethnic
lines. Yet Ford has been, and continues to be, the philanthropic
foundation most heavily involved in Hispanic advocacy politics.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="3">
<P>
<B>WHO DO FORD'S HISPANIC GROUPS REPRESENT?
</B><P>
Ford's decision to create political advocacy organizations was not
  needed by the Hispanic community,. Hispanic have never required
 exclusive ethnic-based mediating structures to serve their
interests.  Working-class Hispanics, for example, have often
preferred labor unions to represent them.  Mexican Americans and
other Hispanic groups serve in leadership positions in the Steelworkers,
United Auto Workers, Food and Commercial Workers, and other industrial
unions in the Midwest and Southwest, as well as in the United
Farm Workers union in California.  The executive vice-president
of the AFL-CIO, Linda Chavez-Thompson, is an Hispanic. 
<P>
Other Hispanics turn to the Catholic Church
to mediate their grievances, and there is a growing evangelical
Protestant ministry to Hispanics.  Many middle-class Hispanics
have joined local civic and business groups that target their
economic or social interests rather than their ethnicity.  In
addition, there are well-established organizations such as
the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).  Founded
in 1929, it is the nation's oldest Hispanic organization dedicated
to assimilation and integration into the larger American society.
 The American G.I. Forum is also an Hispanic group which represents
the needs of  veterans. These Hispanic groups typically pursue
assimilationist goals.  LULAC, for instance, lists the following
member duty in its declaration of purpose: &quot;To foster the
acquisition and facile use of the official language of our country
that we may thereby equip ourselves and our families for the fullest
enjoyment of our rights and privileges and the efficient discharge
of our duties and obligations to this, our country.&quot; Unfortunately,
by the 1970s, LULAC too had veered far to the left, and now is
almost no different from NCLR and MALDEF.
<P>
The original goals of assimilation seemed to suit the majority of Hispanics in 
America --but not the Ford Foundation.  Ford has pursued an agenda that separates 
Hispanics from other Americans and classifies them as a permanent underclass.
 The Ford Foundation instead attempts to copy the political strategies
of the black civil rights movement.  Relying on the advice of
a handful of Mexican American activists like Chicano academics
Julian Samora and Ernesto Galarza and political operator Herman
Gallegos, Ford in the 1960s decided to create new Hispanic institutions
to adopt an anti-assimilationist agenda and supplant the
traditional voices of the Hispanic community in America.
<P>
In its eagerness to mobilize social discontent,
the Ford Foundation has occasionally helped its operatives go
over the line that separates dissent from incitement to violence.
 In 1969, Jose Angel Gutierrez, founder of the La Raza Unida political
party in Texas, told a group of reporters at a press conference
that, &quot;We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean
by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill
him.&quot;  Gutierrez was affiliated with the Mexican America
Youth Organization (MAYO) which had received a $10,000 grant from
a Ford Foundation grantee.  Texas Democratic Congressman Henry
B. Gonzalez was so enraged by Gutierrez' rhetoric that he took
to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to accuse him
of promoting racial hatred.  Gonzalez attacked the Ford Foundation
for indirectly supporting La Raza Unida through its grant to MAYO.
<P>
Fearing that the incident would strengthen
efforts then underway in Congress to limit political advocacy
by tax-exempt foundations, Ford announced at the time that
MAYO was barred from receiving additional Ford money.  However,
some at Ford continued to defend Gutierrez.  For instance, Siobhan
Nicolau, the Ford Foundation program officer, contended that Gutierrez
was provoked to make the statement by hostile questions from the
press.
<P>
Despite incidents like these, Ford has not
been deterred from its commitment to establish extremely political
Hispanic advocacy organizations.  Whatever activists claim, Hispanic
Americans simply have not faced the same level of racial hostility
that African Americans have encountered, and their history in
this country is very different from that of Hispanics.
<P>
Although they have had their difficulties,
Hispanics have never faced the kind of political and legal discrimination
suffered by blacks.  Segregationist Jim Crow laws did not cover
Mexican Americans in the Southwest, for example.
<P>
And although de facto segregation of Hispanic
children existed in South Texas and to a lesser extent in California,
this segregation was not sanctioned by law and it was struck down
when challenged in the courts. As early as 1931 Hispanic parents
had won the right to send their children to school with non-Hispanics
-- even where local officials tried to prevent it.
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="4">
<P>
<B>IN FORD'S DEEP POCKETS</B>
<P>
Despite these historical differences, Ford funds nonprofit
organizations that it hopes will recreate the black civil rights
movement for Hispanics. In 1968, it provided grants to ASPIRA,
the Spanish acronym for a New York City-based Puerto Rican education
group, allowing it to replicate its activities elsewhere.  ASPIRA
was instrumental in forcing New York City schools to test all
Hispanic children for placement in all-Spanish &quot;bilingual
education programs&quot; that claimed to be bilingual although
teaching in only one language -- Spanish.  The result of this mandatory
program has been that many non-Spanish speaking children
with Spanish surnames have been placed in Spanish language programs,
even if their parents wished the children to learn English. They
were segregated from the English speaking population. 
<P>
In 1972, Ford helped create the Puerto Rican
Legal Defense and Education Fund to mimic MALDEF's activities.
 In 1974, it provided operating funds for the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project and later the Midwest Voter Registration
Education Project.  All of these shared Ford's segregation-oriented
priorities, rather than respond to the needs of an increasingly
assimilated Hispanic population.  
<P>
Other Hispanic organizations and programs
that have received large Ford Foundation grants include the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)
Education Fund, the National Puerto Rican Coalition, and the Hispanic
Leadership Opportunity Program, which provides internships in
government agencies and public policy groups.  In addition, the
Ford Foundation has contributed to a number of academic programs
for Hispanics, including grants for Hispanic research to the City
University of New York, the University of Texas, and the University
of Michigan. Some of this reasarch has been legitimate scholarship.
 It was in 1963 that Ford funded a major UCLA study of Mexican
Americans. The &quot;Mexican American Study Project&quot; would
span five years and it involved field research in twenty cities.
 What resulted was an authoritative work on the history, demography,
institutions, and political participation of Mexican Americans:
 <I>The Mexican American People: The Nation's Second Largest Minority</I>,
by UCLA professors Leo Grebler, Joan Moore, and Ralph Guzman.
However, many of the more recent Ford-funded programs have been
politically tendentious rather than scholarly.
<P>
Other grantmaking foundations like Carnegie
and Rockefeller also fund Hispanic advocacy organizations as do
the philanthropic arms of corporations like Coors, Kellogg's,
Anheuser-Busch, BankAmerica and Pepsico.  The federal government
has also provided grants to Hispanic advocacy groups for job training
and other programs.  But neither the federal government nor any
other grantmaker has matched Ford in terms of long-term commitment
or amount of money contributed.  Indeed, the Ford Foundation has
virtually created the infrastructure of the contemporary Hispanic
policy movement.
<P>
With the support of the Ford Foundation, the
anti-assimilationist Hispanic organizations have scored notable
successes in politics and public relations at the expense of the
rich vitality and diversity of the community of Americans of Hispanic
origin. 
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="5"><B>
<P>
PERPETUATING  STEREOTYPES</B>
<P>
Today, as a result of the efforts of the Ford Foundation,  in the
public mind and for all agencies of the U.S. government the
entire Hispanic American population is classified as a disadvantaged
minority group.  This encompasses the native-born and the recent
immigrant:  rich, white-European Argentine or Cuban Americans
as well as English-speaking blacks from Central America's
Caribbean coast.  It covers the Nahuatl-speaking Mexican
Indian and Peruvian-born descendants of Japanese immigrants to
South America.  For the purpose of political organization, it
makes no difference whether the &quot;Hispanic&quot; is a new
arrival or a citizen whose family has lived in the United States
for a dozen generations, descendants of holders of the Spanish
land grants covering millions of acres, or the head of the Coca-Cola
Corporation.
<P>
By linking disparate groups together and claiming
to represent them all, Hispanic organizations have been able to
acquire political power.  By promoting divisions between Hispanics
and non-Hispanics, they have maintained and strengthened
their power through &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics.  In
particular, they have encouraged the mind-set of the dependent
Hispanic &quot;victim&quot; _ something NCLR does especially well.
 Raul Yzaguirre, NCLR president, plays on these insecurities.
 He told the<I> Rocky Mountain News</I> this past summer:  &quot;The
bigotry and racism sweeping our country should be of concern not
just to minorities but to all Americans.  We will no longer tolerate
those in our society who fan the flames of this hatred to further
their careers or their political aspirations.&quot;
<P>
In 1994 Yzaguirre's inflamatory remarks were
reported in <I>Ethnic NewsWatch</I> published by a Hispanic news
group.  He told an Hispanic audience that &quot;every single federal
program and almost every public program discriminates against
Latinos.  That is not an accusation.  It's a fact.  Those realities
don't happen by accident.  Nobody else has less political power
in proportion to their numbers.&quot;
<P>
Yzaguirre also boasted of the increased political
clout Hispanic organizations like his could muster:  &quot;That
infrastructure has made it possible to have a rise in political
power. Now there are over five thousand elected Latino officials.
 <I>Hay orgullo.  Hay esperanza.</I>  We know we'll fulfill Walt
Whitman's prediction that Mexican Americans in the Southwest would
be the salvation of this country.&quot;
<P>
<a href="#top">Table of Contents</a>
<a name="6"><B>
<P>
THE AGENDA BEHIND FORD'S AGENDA
</B><P>
That MALDEF and NCLR understand the political importance of
dividing Americans this way is apparent in the kinds of public
policy issues they pursue most vigorously.  In immigration policy,
they ardently defend high levels of immigration and generous social
and safety net programs for immigrants.  Yet according to the
National Latino Political Survey, 75 percent of Mexican Americans
feel that there are too many immigrants in the U.S. now.  MALDEF
ignores the opinions of the people it claims to represent because
it knows that high levels of immigration serve its own purposes.
<P>
In areas like income and education, the continued
immigration of low-skilled and poorly-educated Hispanics
keeps general Hispanic achievement levels below that of non-Hispanic
whites.  This justifies the panoply of government programs that
advocacy groups say Hispanics want and need.  In fact, second
and third generation Hispanics are very much assimilated and enjoy
earnings and education levels comparable to non-Hispanics.
 On average, the weekly earnings of native-born Mexican American
men are about 83 percent those of non-Hispanic white men.
 When variables like schooling, experience, hours worked, and
geographical region of residence are taken into account, Mexican
American men earn about 93 percent of the weekly earnings of comparable
non-Hispanic white men.
<P>
Because Hispanics do not share any common
racial characteristics or national histories, political advocacy
groups like MALDEF and NCLR focus on language and culture to reinforce
a separate Hispanic ethnic identity.  With this goal in mind,
programs such as bilingual education become tools used to maintain
Hispanic language and culture and reduce the possibility of assimilation,
particularly among children.  By devaluing the importance of English
to American citizens, the bilingual ballot elevates Spanish and
makes it a quasi-official language.  These ballots are also used
to include Hispanics under the provisions of the Voting Rights
Act, which virtually guarantees ethnically-gerrymandered Hispanic
congressional districts. 
<P>
Because Hispanic organizations want to segregate
the community they claim to represent from the mainstream of America's
democracy, they hold in contempt all proposals to make English
the official language of the United States.  Yet significant numbers
of Hispanics do not agree.  The National Latino Political Survey
found in 1992 that well over 40 percent of Mexican Americans and
almost 50 percent of Puerto Ricans support legislation to make
English America's official language. That is significant support
for &quot;English Only.&quot;
<P>
Affirmative action, a program that richly
rewards racial and ethnic identity politics, is also used to divide
us.  Middle and upper-class Hispanics have always been assimilated
into mainstream American culture to a very great extent.  The
intermarriage rate between Hispanics and non-Hispanics, which
is almost 50 percent for Mexican Americans in California, is only
one indication of the effects of the process of assimilation.
 But ethnicity-based preferences and set-asides are a great incentive
for any group to identify itself by ethnicity.  Any group that
is offered preferential treatment in admission to universities,
jobs and job promotions, and non-competitive awards of government
contracts that pay well above the market rate is sure to take
advantage.  But it is also likely eventually to lose support from
the majority of those who receive no such privileges.  And the
genuine achievements of members of a politically-preferred ethnic
group will come under unfair suspicion. 
<P>
Nevertheless, over the past year the Ford
Foundation has distributed $1.4 million in grants to a dozen organizations
for litigation, research, and advocacy in favor of affirmative
action.  This year the Ford Foundation has contributed over $500,000
to several organizations specifically opposing California's Proposition
209, which is also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative.
 MALDEF launched legal challenges and a media campaign to defeat
the ballot initiative that would bar the state of California from
using race, ethnicity, or gender to discriminate against or grant
preferential treatment to any person or group.  No doubt, if the
measure passes, groups supported by the Ford Foundation will challenge
its constitutionality all the way to the Supreme Court.
<P>
The success or failure of this ballot proposition
to endure such challenges from Ford and its operatives will determine
whether America takes a step forward or backwards from equal opportunity
for all.

<H3>Georgie Anne Geyer's Americans No More: Is Citizenship Dead? 
</H3>
<H4>by Robert Huberty
</H4>
<P>
<I>Americans No More: The Death of Citizenship by Georgie Anne Geyer (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1996, 352 pages.) 
</I>
It is syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer's thesis that the concept of citizenship has lost meaning for increasing numbers of Americans.
The civic bond that links Americans of all backgrounds by a committment to certain universal ideas of freedom and equality is unravelling. The
signs are everywhere, not least in the debate over how we decide who is an American. 
<P>
Geyer argues that the decline of citizenship has been hastened by political actions and economic developments that are driving us apart. At
home, politicians and advocacy groups are exploiting racial and ethnic conflict and are "retribalizing" communities to acquire political power.
This development is worldwide. In the former Yugoslavia, in India and Lebanon, and now in the U.S. politicians are making their careers by
demanding group rights and legal privileges for specific nationalities and subcultures. In America they are abetted by ethnic group advocacy
organizations that derive their support from private foundation grants and not from the ethnic groups they purport to represent. Geyer
describes how this process is fostering disunity in the name of diversity and only benefits those whose careers depend on it. As political and
media elites celebrate multiculturalism and denigrate individual merit and equal opportunity, the idea of a common American civic culture
atrophies. 
<P>
In contrast to domestic politics, U.S. economic institutions increasingly operate in a global marketplace. Politicians and government
bureaucrats are losing control over currency exchange rates, labor and capital markets, and the flow of information. Most conservatives
welcome this trend because it increases the power of the individual. But Geyer worries that globalization will make us less respectful of national laws and patriotic sentiments. American financial and government leaders will feel more at home dealing with their foreign counterparts over abstract issues than with the real problems of their fellow countrymen: No longer farmers and merchants in the town square, they will decide price changes and power shifts in conference calls at international airports between flights to high-level conferences. Officials of international agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will also relax their national loyalties as they roam the world offering money and advice. Can such people recognize the tangible obligations and benefits of citizenship? 
<P>
In such a world what becomes of Americans who, as Tocqueville observed, join local associations to accomplish tasks without government
but with their neighbors? What will sustain citizens when the laws and institutions that guarantee equal opportunity are delegitimized at home
and displaced abroad? 
<P>
Geyer blames U.S. policymakers for letting special interest groups take the initiative in determining what new citizens and immigrants will think about America. As a journalist, she has roamed the country talking with scholars and public officials. Her interviews with those who are in charge of administering the laws regulating U.S. immigration and naturalization are especially revealing, and this reporting is the most valuable part of her book. 
<P>
For instance, Geyer reports in detail on the dumbed-down U.S. citizenship exams that the Immigration Act of 1990 now permits the nonprofit
Educational Testing Service (ETS) to administer. In place of requiring immigrants to give oral responses to questions posed by an Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) officer at a government office, officials say immigrants can choose to take a user-friendly ETS multiple choice test at a community center. And they can take the test as many times as they need to pass it. ETS proudly reports that it relies on a battery of Hispanic and refugee organizations like the Mexican American Legal Defense and and Education Fund (MALDEF) for advice on its testing policies and procedures. 
<P>
Instead of "Americanizing" new citizens, Geyer says ethnic advocacy groups are promoting a "reverse colonization" that would adapt our
citizenship to the ethnicity of the immigrant. Groups like MALDEF help immigrants become U.S. citizens without adequate knowledge of our
history, laws or language. They extract government entitlements for legal and illegal aliens, and raise obstacles to efforts to stop illegal
immigration. In lobbying over the content of civics in school textbooks and public ceremonies, ethnic advocacy groups too often sacrifice the ideas of the Founding Fathers to illiberal cultures of blood and soil. But most immigrants do not support their most strident demands. Surveys show that immigrants want to learn English quickly, to be assimilated to American culture, and to work and prosper. Far from being a cry of the people, MALDEF's legal briefs and the pronouncements of La Raza derive from the agenda of program officers at the Ford Foundation and other philanthropic grantmakers. Geyer's chapter on the Ford Foundation, excerpted in the National Review -- complemented by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle in this issue -- reviews the history of Ford's imposed revolution from above. 
<P>
Geyer's conclusion seems at odds with many of her findings. Apparently persuaded that Americans are throwing away their birthright and
overwhelmed by a sense of social breakdown, Geyer succumbs to emotions unsuited to the sharp reporting of her earlier chapters. She
describes the beauty of southern Wisconsin, where her family has a lakeside cottage, and compares it to an unlovely California marred by
criminal gangs, high taxes, overcrowding, gated communities, and illegal aliens. 
<P>
Instead of keeping her sights on the political and financial backers of ethnic political advocacy, she seems frightened by immigrants
themselves and appears to hold them responsible for the contrast that disturbs her. But America is more than southern Wisconsin, and the
type of political advocacy to which she objects would surely continue even without immigration. (If there were fewer universities, would
political correctness end?) 
<P>
Some argue that the alternative to the era of big government is big citizenship. Likewise, the alternative to the political demands of the ethnic
lobbies is to recognize and encourage the positive social achievements of immigrants.

Letters to the Editor</H3><BR>
<P>
 Thank you for the newsletter about
the Joyce Foundation. 
I know you write from a special viewpoint,
as is your right.  You'd have a better chance to sell
that view if you got the details right instead of getting into
a position where facts undermine your whole argument. Among the
serious errors in the article are these lesser ones pertaining
to me:
<P>
Daly is) &quot;a practicing Catholic.&quot;
That error made my Catholic mother-in-law happy but I remain a
non-practicing Protestant.
<P>
(Daly is) &quot;an active Democrat.&quot;
Nope,  just a registered, inactive Democrat who has crossed the
line often (and privately).
<P>
&quot;A lieutenant said...&quot; Nope.
Colonels makes those statements, lieutenants just get shot.
<P>
&quot;Daly did confess that he had
himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship.&quot;
Wrong. I have never applied for or received a scholarship. At
Columbia I did get that money by winning a competition to determine
which student had acquired the best understanding of the laws
governing libel.
<P>
As your concluding lines suggested,
I have taken another look at the direction the Joyce Foundation
is heading. I am delighted with the course and hope I can help
Deborah Leff maintain it.

Congratulations on Alicia Shepard's meticulously researched and well written study
of Pew's foray into civic journalism [&quot;Buying Press Coverage:
How Pew's Civic Journalism Projects Put Newspapers, Radio and
Television Stations on the Payroll,&quot; vol. 1, no. 7].
<P>
While civic journalism may skew reporting
away from &quot;hard&quot; news and demanding examination of government
(and away form cynicism, its supporters would add), your article
displayed no such bias toward either side of the debate.
<P>
I was impressed and look forward to
future detailed examinations of foundations' activities.</FONT>

I wanted to tell you how much I enjoy
<I>Foundation Watch</I>. It tells me an awful lot about some villains
I didn't know nearly enough about, including the wicked Rebecca
Rimel. It is sickening to see what has happened to the Pew Foundation
under her regime, although there must have been some rot there
to have seen hiring her as a good idea in the first place. As
someone old enough to have recalled Howard Pew while he was still
alive (he was a doughty warrior in the labor-management wars of
the 30s and 40s, among other things) I can only be saddened by
yet one more 180 degree turn in a foundation that was set up for
totally different purposes than those which it now brazenly carries out.

<center><h2>Why Did America's First Woman Televsion sportscaster become a
conservative radio talk-show hostess?</h2><BR>
</center>
<center><h3>by Laurence Jarvik</h3></center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<DD><FONT SIZE=+2><I>J</I></FONT>ane Chastain lives about as far as it is possible to be from
Washington, DC's notorious Beltway. Her home sits atop a mountain
outside Palm Springs, California. She commutes to her apperances
on CNN and Crawford broadcasting's radio shows in her Cessna 336
from the landing strip in front of her home (both she and her
husband, Roger Chastain, are licensed pilots with multiand instrument
ratings). Chastain is a frequent guest on &quot;CNN and Company&quot;
and author of <I>I'd Speak Out On The Issues If I Only Knew What
To Say</I> (Regal Books, 1987). She contributed a chapter to <I>Good
Will Toward Men</I> (St. Martin's Press, 1994), a book in praise of
the masculine sex and has her own newsletter called <I>On The Issues</I>.
Her Crawford Broadcasting radio talk show, &quot;What Washington
Doesn't Want You To Know,&quot; is syndicated to l8 stations from
Southern California's KBRT. Chastain was one of the first &quot;Renaissance&quot;
women to join the prestigious Washington leadership group founded
by Ambassador Holland Coors and Nina May in 1983, which has grown
to 6,000 members.
<P>
Chastain began her career as &quot;Coach Friday&quot; on Atlanta's WAGA in 1963,
 eventually moving to Miami's WTVJ, where for 9 years she worked as a sports reporter. 
She syndicated a radio series called <I>Football for Women</I>--ironically designed to
explain the sport to her husband, a race car driver and designer
who didn't understand the principles of the game--followed by
another series of 260 shows called Girls Rules, syndicated to
205 radio stations. This led to a television deal: 195 90--second
spots syndicated to 88 television stations called <I>The Jane Chastain
Show: Evertyhing You've Always Wanted To Know About Sports But
Were Afraid To Ask.</I> Still in her twenties, Jane Chastain was a
television star. In 1974 CBS hired her as the first woman network
sportscaster in the country. She covered NBA basketball, the Pan
American Games, pro golf, tennis, cycling, and surfing. She was
a pit reporter for auto racing coverage. Most importantly, Chastain
covered NFL football, including the Sun Bowl and the Cotton Bowl,
and developed stong ties to the Miami Dolphins and their winning
coach, Don Shula.
<P>
<BR>
When Chastain first came to Dolphin coach George Wilson,  however, he objected 
to the idea of a woman sportscaster. &quot;Well, she won't come to my
camp, &quot; Wilson vowed. Chastain patiently persevered, attended
training camp, and by the end of the season Wilson had responded
to her determination. He came up to her and announced, &quot;I'll
give you that interview.&quot; After the session, she recalled,
&quot;the players ran over, picked me up, and threw me in the
Dumpster. And it was like saying, 'Okay, you've made it; you've
been accepted; you're one of us. Congratulations.'&quot; Unlike
some feminists who might have filed a harrassment complaint these
days, Chastain took her experience as a compliment. She later
told an interviewer, &quot;Well, I think it was a friendly gesture.
I hadn't tried to make an issue of what Wilson was doing. I never
went up to those players and bellyached and complained about their
boss; I never put them in a compromising position of having to
talk to me about what an awful person Coach Wilson was. I think
the fact that I didn't make an issue out if it is actually what
caused him to address it. If you have a disagreement with somebody
and you try to back them up against the wall, then they get caught
up in defending themselves rather than examining their own position
to see if it's tenable.&quot;  Chastain has overcome personal
obstacles as well. When an Atlanta station executive started giving
her a hard time, after confessing he was in love with her and
finding himself rejected, Chastain went looking for another job.
She got an interview at a Raleigh, North Carolina television station
and was hired by Jesse Helms -- over vocal objections from the
station's executive vice-president, who didn't believe women should
cover sports.  &quot;It makes the hair on the back of my neck
stand up when I hear accusations that Jesse's against women,&quot;
Chastain says. &quot;I expected my career was over, and he gave
me a chance. He did more for hiring women and people of color
than anyone I knew in broadcasting.&quot; 
<P>
<BR>
Locker rooms held no charm for Chastain at first, and she tried to avoid entering the male  
domain while working at local stations. &quot;I didn't think
they should have to give interviews in various stages of undress,&quot;
she says. But when she became the first woman sportscaster for
CBS in 1974, Chastain was required to go inside to conduct interviews
in order to meet -- and beat -- her competitors.  The invasion
of privacy still rankles her. &quot;You will not find any men
demanding access to the female's dressing rooms. They have not
allowed male reporters in there. Yet, on the other side, in the
male locker room, everyone is afraid to say no.&quot; Chastain
dealt with the challenge as discreetly as possible, setting up
her cameras facing a wall by the door so that she would not be
exposed to the athletes against their will, and arranging to leave
the locker room as soon as the interviews had been completed.
&quot;Now, that didn't mean I was a prude,&quot; she recalled.
&quot;I'd been married for a number of years and didn't expect
to see anything that I hadn't seen before. I just respected their
privacy.&quot; But her personal experience with the double standard
helped plant a seed of doubt about the claims of the feminist
movement.  Eventually, America's first female sportscaster would
become a devoted opponent of the goals and tactics of the women's
liberation movement.
<P>
<BR>
Motherhood made all the difference for Jane 
   Chastain. She realized her viewpoint was 
       no longer that of a careerist in 1975 while covering the
Pan American Games for CBS. &quot;When I called home every night
and heard my baby cry, that's when my own priorities changed,&quot;
she recalled.&quot; And it didn't take long for me to discover
that the quality of time I was able to give my family was actually
in an inverse ratio to the quantity of time I spent on my job.&quot;
In 1976 she became sports anchor at KABC in Los Angeles, and in
1978 struck out on her own as a documentary filmmaker, author,
and radio personality on both National Public Radio and the Sports
Radio Network. Yet in her work, Chastain decided to confront feminism
directly, pointing out that sixty-one percent of the nation's
top female executives are childless, as opposed to fourteen percent
of the women in the general population.&quot;I talked about the
fact that female physicians take fewer patients per hour, and
choose to work fewer hours,&quot; she says. &quot;You don't get
to the top job on flextime.&quot; Chastain said she realized that
feminists &quot;don't play fair, they want their piece of cake
and yours, too.&quot; Soon Chastain was in the public eye as a
vocal opponent of the movement. She testified to the Presidential
Commission on Women in Combat against sending women into battle,
in her newsletter she published the findings of the Center for
Military Readiness on double standards applied to female aviators,
and she wrote columns arguing that the feminists were prepared
to sacrifice the lives of American women to promote their ideology.
&quot;Is it fair that we ask these same women to go into combat
against the all-male armies of countries that are not equal opportunity
employers?&quot; she asked. &quot;Our women will be putting out
an equal effort, but in the end they will be dying in unequal
numbers.&quot;

Why doesn't a journal for the best high school history papers have support from groups professing an interest in the future of education?
</h3></center>

<p>
By Laurence Jarvik
<P>
<BR>
 When Will Fitzhugh quit teaching high school history in Concord, Massachusetts nine years ago to start
 <i>The Concord Review</i>, he didn't know that it would be so difficult to find backers for his venture. 
The premise for his quarterly publication was simple: to publish the best history papers by public and private 
high school students in the United States so that teachers and students alike would have access to examples
 of excellence. High standards for writing history could be encouraged through learning by example. Fitzhugh, 
a graduate of Harvard University (Class of 1960), thought that there would be a natural demand among 
teachers for his effort to publicize essays written by the "best and the brightest." He was surprised when his 
request for funding was rejected by 125 foundations, the Department of Education, and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities.  
<P>
Fitzhugh cashed in his retirement account and put one hundred thousand dollars of his own money into 
<i>The Concord Review</i>, whose first issue appeared  in 1988. What Fitzhugh did not realize was that 
while he was pursuing teaching history in the public high schools, the field of academic history was changing.
 The lifelong Democrat had become an unknowing participant in the culture wars. The rejections he received 
from foundations and government agencies were the results of a paradigm shift which preferred group identity 
to individual merit. "Sometimes they tell me they are only interested in the work of minority students," 
Fitzhugh recalled, "and sometimes they say they cannot see the value of supporting the work of just a few 
good youngsters." Fitzhugh's position that minority students are "welcome to contribute their work" and to 
be judged on the basis of its excellence fell on deaf ears.
<P>
That Fitzhugh's journal would be caught up in the controversy over politically correct high school history came 
as a surprise. When the <i>National Standards for United States History</i> were released in 1994, they 
listed <i>The Concord Review</i> among approved "teaching resources for United States history" as "an 
exceptional teaching tool modeling outstanding essays research (sic) and written by high school 
students... Recommended for grades 9-12." Two essays were featured in a special January, 1995 
<i>Concord Review</i> as the best of the year. Neither could be considered conservative. Aaron Einbond, a
 sophomore at New York City's elite public Hunter College High School, contributed a study of John 
Maynard Keynes based on citations from liberal  economists John Kenneth Galbraith and Robert Lekachman.
 Pia Lindstrom Luedtke, a sophomore at the private Polytechnic School of Pasadena, offered a feminist 
interpretation of the career of architect Julia Morgan entitled "Blueprint for Social Change." The high-schooler
 had already enjoyed one official seal of approval: in 1993 Luedtke received a $1900 grant from the National 
Endowment for the Humanities  through the NEH Younger Scholars Program to write her essay over summer 
vacation. Other essays published in The Concord Review included accounts of baseball's Negro Leagues, 
women's suffrage, President Woodrow Wilson's vision of the League of Nations, the role of women in the 
French Revolution, and a critique of Frederick Jackson Turner based on the work of liberal historian Richard 
Hofstadter.  <i>The Concord Review</i> also published essays on the development of the Ferris Wheel and 
the power loom and an analysis of  how Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis continued the debate between 
the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists. A glance at issues provided to <i>Culture Watch</i> shows little in 
the way of what might be categorized as conservative history: for example, the legacy of conservative 
statesmen, scientists, businessmen,  intellectuals, military history, or criticism of leftist historical figures 
and trends.  
<P>
Fitzhugh is a colorful character. The son of a prominent Boston physician, at the age of two Fitzhugh moved 
to Arizona with his mother after his parents divorced. Graduating from a boarding school in Menlo Park, 
California after winning a prize by answering 1000 questions correctly (the first time a student had done 
so in 17 years), he went to work as a lumberjack.  Fitzhugh entered Harvard in 1956 after his father brought 
him back East with an offer to pay his tuition. He graduated in 1962 with an English degree, spent a year 
doing graduate work in English literature at Cambridge University, and in 1964 went to work for the Apollo 
space program preparing charts used in the construction of the Command Module. This led to a job with 
Pan Am as a management trainee. Fitzhugh returned to Cambridge, Massachussetts where he obtained a 
masters degree in education from Harvard.  After jobs with the Peace Corps (which sent him to Iran), 
Westinghouse, and Polaroid, Fitzhugh went into teaching, first working as a guidance counselor and, in 1978,
 as a social studies teacher at Concord High School. He started <i>The Concord Review</i> to give 
recognition to good students, "the ones who are doing better than we think they are." In its first year the 
magazine had subscribers in 14 states, and soon had support from both Harold Howe, a Harvard professor 
and Commissioner of Education in the Johnson administration, and Chester Finn, Assistant Secretary of 
Education in the Reagan administration. Finn gave Fitzhugh $10,000 from the Fordham foundation. Howe 
wrote letters to 15 foundations on his behalf.  
<P>
A traditional liberal approach to history -- narratives of great men, nations, and ideas -- is not in keeping with 
trends in political correctness sweeping education. Against his will, Fitzhugh is being pushed into the 
conservative camp.  His notion that <i>The Concord Review</i> is a form of "varsity academics" is offensive 
to advocates of the new pedagogy. The very educational nostrums which brought Fitzhugh to Harvard in 
1956 from a logging camp are now considered obsolete and elitist. The new view of history is instrumental, 
and high school history has become a kind of sensitivity training. Robert Lerner, Althea K. Nagai, and 
Stanley Rothman have called the process <i>Molding the Good Citizen</i> (Prager, 1995) in their review of 
the politics of high school history texts. They point out that civil rights groups, feminists, peace activists 
and environmentalists have all "sought to change the schools in specific ways to bring about a new 
social order." Because Fitzhugh's journal does not pretend to fight oppression by race, class and sex, its 
purpose is suspect. "It used to be people on both sides of the aisle thought standards were a good idea," 
Fitzhugh told <i>Culture Watch</i>. "Now anybody who thinks reading and writing and doing homework is 
a good idea is considered a conservative."

For Immediate Release<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER>Professor Claims Race and Sex <BR>
Based Discrimination Committed by Bowling Green</CENTER></FONT><BR>


<P>     Dr. John Hartman filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday claiming that he was denied employment at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) because of illegal discrimination.  He is suing the university and its accrediting agency--the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC)--for sex and race based discrimination in violation of his equal protection rights.  Dr. Hartman is a white male.

<P>     In 1991, ACEJMC rescinded the journalism department's full accreditation, citing among the reasons for denial the perceived underrepresentation of women and minority faculty.  While the agency did not claim that BGSU had discriminated, it did require the department to eliminate the perceived imbalance in order to regain full accreditation.  BGSU's journalism department acceded to the ACEJMC's demands, and set-aside a number of future positions for women and minorities.

<P>     When Dr. Hartman applied for a teaching position at Bowling Green in 1994, his qualifications included a Ph.d in communication and twelve years teaching experience, as well as experience conducting seminars on mass communication and diversity, serving as a minority student mentor for several years, and publishing numerous scholarly works.  Despite his credentials, Bowling Green denied Dr. Hartman employment and instead offered the position to a black female who did not have a Ph.d, had significantly less teaching experience, and had a less impressive publishing record.

<P>     Following the hiring decision, Dr. Hartman filed a complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC).  OCRC found probable cause that the university had discriminated against Dr. Hartman, declaring that his "expertise and educational experience in the field of journalism more closely met the job requirements compared to the background of the successful candidate. . . ."  When subsequent mediation efforts between the parties failed, OCRC held a formal hearing in March on the issue, the results of which are pending.

<P>     In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, Dr. Hartman is seeking an injunction against the university and the accrediting agency which would prohibit them from discriminating against him on the basis of race and sex.  He is further seeking instatement to the position for which he was wrongfully denied employment, and damages resulting from the denial of employment.

<P>     Michael Rosman, attorney for Dr. Hartman and General Counsel for the Center for Individual Rights, stated that "Bowling Green and its accrediting agency created a system where, regardless of Dr. Hartman's qualifications, he could not have been hired simply because he is a white male.  It is precisely this sort of egregious deprivation of rights that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits."

<P>     To receive a copy of the complaint, or for more information about the case, call Robert Alt, Director of Public Relations and Education for the Center for Individual Rights, at 202-833-8400, ext. 101.

<h1>Preface</h1>

Over 200 years ago, a revolution began upon the continent of 
America, the richest and greatest territory discovered by the civilization 
of Europe.  It did not begin on battlefields, with the clash of armies, but 
with deliberations among a few people.  Most of these people were 
Protestant Christians, and most of their debates took place, in the 
beginning, in churches.  
<P>
In conducting a revolution and framing a new constitution,  our 
Founders followed certain principles.  They did not dream up these 
principles out of nothing.  The principles came to them by study and 
acute observation of their situation.  These prin-ciples express great 
truths that apply at all times and to all men.  But they are not merely 
abstract and general.  They are practical and solid.    
<P>
For one thing, the Founders noticed that many former  nations had 
been built upon specific religious teachings.  They noticed that these 
nations tended to fight wars over matters     of religious doctrine, 
outlaw certain sects, and persecute people for their beliefs.  Indeed, 
many of our forefathers had come to America in order to practice their 
faith without hindrance or impediment.  
<P>
The tradition in England at the time was religious tolera-tion.  
Doctrinal differences with the Church of England were held to be 
wrong.  They were tolerated, but in that toleration was the frown of 
disapproval, carrying with it restrictions in how much property one 
might own or whether one might hold public office.  The Founders 
replaced this tradition with the idea of religious freedom.  
<P>
Religious freedom goes beyond toleration.  It was expressed by 
President Washington in his marvelous letter to the Hebrew 
congregation in Newport in 1790, marking the first time Jews were 
ever officially welcomed as citizens outside of Israel:  
<p>

<blockquote>
It is now no more that toleration is spoken of as if it were 
the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed 
the exercise of their inherent natural rights, for, happily, 
the government of the United States, which gives to 
bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires 
only that they who live under its protection should demean 
them-selves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions 
their effectual support. . . .  May the children of the Stock 
of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and 
enjoy the good will of the other in-habitants, while every 
one shall sit safely under his own vine and fig tree, and 
there shall be none to make him afraid.
</blockquote>

<p>
The first practical truth of the American founding, then, is religious 
freedom.  One man may not rule another on the basis of his reading of 
revealed scripture.  For that reason, this book of ours does not advance 
its arguments for moral revival on such a basis.  This is not a 
compromise on our part.  We ground our arguments elsewhere because 
it is right.
<p>

The second practical truth will tell us, when we understand it, what 
the Founders meant by human nature and the natural law.  This law 
was available to them, as it is to us, because God talks to human beings 
not only in the scriptures, but also through their reason.
<p>

C. S. Lewis begins a great book with a discussion of the plain moral 
knowledge we are born with.  Listen, says Lewis, to people talking:  
One person says, "I was here first and you took my place away."  The 
second person does not reply, "Yes, and that is good."  Rather he says, 
"No, you were not here first," or "This is my place."  However much 
they may twist the facts, they agree on the standard by which the facts 
may be judged.
<p>

Just as we know that round things are not square, or short things 
tall, or flat things lumpy, we know that infidelity, lying, and theft are 
wrong.  This does not mean that men do not cheat, lie, and steal.  But 
just as imperfection is part of human nature, so is an intuitive grasping 
of moral facts, and an ability to reason from those facts about how best 
to live.  It is one of the ways in which we participate in the divine 
nature.  
<p>

This is what is meant by the law of nature.  It is the law that we 
know innately because we are human.  It forms the  basis of moral life, 
and is compatible with the moral teachings of revelation.  America was 
founded on principles derived from this law of nature or law of reason.  
Our book takes its bearings from these founding principles.
Today the moral fiber of our country is weak and growing weaker, 
largely because the natural law is forgotten or denied.  Consider this 
passage from a 1989 report of The American Council of Learned 
Societies:
<P>

<blockquote>
The consensus of most of [today's] dominant theories is 
that all thought does, indeed, develop from par-ticular 
standpoints, perspectives, interests . . . .  We should not 
equate truth with our own political ideology . . . .  At its 
best, contemporary humanistic thinking . . . attempts to 
sensitize us to the presence of ideology in our own work, 
and to its capacity to delude us into promoting as 
universal, values that in fact belong to one nation, one 
social class, one sect. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Such moral relativism has been the predominant doctrine in 
American universities for decades.  Today we see it filtered down in 
the media and popular culture, where the easy senti-ments of modern 
liberalism go for the most part unchallenged. 
<P>

The six chapters in our book explain how this abandonment of the 
natural law has spawned radical new public policies:  sanction (and 
even subsidies) for pornography and sexual licentiousness, 
redistribitive taxes that undermine the idea of property rights, an 
intrusive welfare state that wreaks destruction on the American 
character, and a bureaucratized, "value-free" public school system.  
Each chapter, in turn, sup-plies arguments and actions needed to 
reverse these policies, and to return to policies which support the 
family.
<P>

In addition we include two appendices, which make a simple point:  
Morality and politics are inseparable, and there is nothing more 
American than bringing one's religious and moral views to bear on 
political issues.  This runs counter to the propaganda of America's 
intellectual and political elites today.  But what these people mean 
when they tell us to check our deepest held beliefs when we conduct 
ourselves politically is this:  "We know better than you how you should 
live and raise your children.  Let us have our way."  Nothing could be 
more foreign to what our Founders had in mind.
<P>

Neither moral relativism nor the desire to rule grown people as if 
they were children (or worse) is anything new.  At the dawn of 
American democracy, the Founders rejected the relativist views of 
the philosopher Hobbes, which James Wilson, one of the leading 
members of the Constitutional Convention, condemned as "totally 
repugnant to all human sentiment, and all human experience."  Of 
course, the Declara-tion of Independence is itself the greatest 
expression of our Founders' non-relativist understanding of man as a 
created being with unalienable rights, which rights governments are 
formed to protect.  As for despotism, we need only recall King George 
and his colonial tax collectors.
<P>

We must aim today at something like a repetition of the story of the 
founding.  We must reject the bad ideas behind the policies that have 
brought our country to its current crisis.  We must replace these bad 
policies with good ones.  The history of our nation tells us that only 
one method of moral reform is possible:  to call America back to her 
highest principles, to her better self.  In that spirit The Claremont 
Institute is proud to publish Moral Ideas for America.

<h2>The First Amendment and Pornography</h2>
<h3>Francis Canavan</h3>
</center>

The clause of the First Amendment that is relevant to the subject of 
pornography is:  "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the 
freedom of speech or of the press."  The Supreme Court, through its 
interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, has applied this clause to 
state and local governments, so that all levels of government in this 
country are bound by it.  The question before us now is, what is this 
freedom of speech or of the press that is protected by the Amendment?
I am not going to argue that the Supreme Court has spoken, that the 
matter is settled, that there is nothing more to discuss, and that those 
who disagree with me should therefore shut up.  I leave that kind of 
argument to people on the other side.  But I will occasionally cite 
Supreme Court decisions, because I want to show that the Supreme 
Court has occasionally said things that support my case.
<P>

Indeed, contrary to common opinion, the Court has never actually 
banned any and all regulation of freedom of speech and press.  I feel 
safe in saying that it has never subscribed to the view that freedom of 
speech is absolute-or that obscenity as such is protected by it.  
<P>

For example, in 1961, in the case of Konigsberg v. State Bar of 
California, the Court held that "constitutionally protected freedom of 
speech is narrower than an unlimited license to talk."  In a footnote it 
pointed out that any contrary view "cannot be reconciled with the law 
relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false 
advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, 
conspiracy and the like." 
<P>

The other point of view, against which I stand, is what I will call the 
absolutist view of freedom of speech and press-a view that is 
sometimes called "First Amendment fundamentalism."  This was 
represented on the Supreme Court by Justices Black and Douglas in 
their day.  According to them, the only line that can be drawn legally or 
constitutionally is between speech and conduct.  If it is speech, it is 
protected absolutely.  If it becomes conduct, then the state can regulate 
it.  For all practical purposes, Justices Brennan and Marshall later sub-
scribed to the same view.  That is to say, they approached it without 
ever quite reaching it.  But it was effectively the same.  
<P>

Whether among people on the Court or off it, this absolutist school 
of thought has telescoped freedom of speech and press into "freedom 
of expression."  "Expression" started out as a sort of shorthand way of 
referring to speech and press, but now covers things that are 
neither-like what the Court has described as "nonobscene nude 
dancing."  When you get to that point, it doesn't matter what is 
expressed or how it is expressed, so long as it is expressed rather than 
done.  The fact of expression is all that really matters.  Thus expression 
is detached from any public or societal purpose that it is supposed to 
serve.  Expression becomes its own end and its own justification.  
Therefore there can be no constitutional limit on it.  That is what I call 
the absolutist view.  
<P>

I am advancing an opposite position which holds that a rational 
interpretation of the constitutional freedom of speech and press must 
consider the purposes which that freedom is intended to serve.  And 
that in any given case coming before the courts, it must be asked 
whether the particular speech or publication or expression in question 
has any discernible relation to those purposes.  Why?  Because the end 
or purpose of the free speech and free press guarantee-or indeed of any 
legal or constitutional right-is the rationale or the principle that justifies 
it. 
<P>

<center>
<h3>Rights Have Purposes, Hence Limits</h3>
</center>

We do not legally recognize or create rights for no purpose 
whatsoever.  We have in each instance something that we wish to 
achieve.  Once we admit this, and admit that the constitutional 
guarantee of freedom of speech and press has a purpose or purposes, 
we have also accepted the principle that limits it.
<P>

In addition to justifying the guarantee, the purpose indicates what 
the limits are; if a particular expression has little or no discernible 
relation to the purpose of the First Amendment guarantee, or, even 
more, if it positively impedes that purpose, then it is not protected by 
the guarantee.  
<P>

The Supreme Court in 1942 made a statement which, I think, is still 
valid today, in deciding the case of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire:
<P>

<blockquote>
There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited 
classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which 
have never been thought to raise any constitutional 
problems.  These include the lewd and obscene, the 
profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" 
words-those which by their very utterance inflict injury or 
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.  It has 
been well observed that such utterances are no essential 
part of any exposition of ideas and are of such slight social 
value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived 
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in 
order and morality. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Notice, this says that the First Amendment guarantee has a 
purpose-the search for truth-against which one can weigh a particular 
utterance; and also that if one finds this utterance has little or no role in 
this search, or in the exposition of ideas, then it can be outweighed by 
the social interest in morality.
<P>

Of course, one will not find in the Supreme Court's opinions 
anywhere a catalogue of all the purposes of the First Amendment in a 
hierarchical arrangement.  Nor will one find a catalogue of the social 
interests that can outweigh them.  But there are plenty of statements 
indicating that the Court does recognize (however reluctantly) that 
some kinds of speech are more important than others, that some are 
pretty unimportant, and that some are simply off the scale and not 
protected at all.
<P>

In other words, the social interest that justifies limiting or even pro-
hibiting low kinds of speech need not be great.  When dealing with a 
high kind of speech, on the other hand, we have to weigh in something 
as important as the national security in order to justify any sort of 
limitation.
<P>

So the freedoms of speech and press are defined by goals.  They are 
broad but not unlimited.  The principal goal of these freedoms is to 
furnish a necessary condition for running a representative, democratic 
form of government.  Clearly, there can't be a democracy where people 
can't talk or write about politics, or campaign for or against candidates 
or tickets or policies.  More broadly, as has been said over and over 
again-not only in the opinions of the Supreme Court, but in the whole 
tradition of defending free speech and press going back to John 
Milton's Areopagitica-the purpose of this freedom is the pursuit of 
truth or-to use a phrase of which the Court is fond-the establishment of 
"a free marketplace of ideas," in which truth may emerge.  We should 
note in this context, and emphasize the fact, that the free speech and 
press clause presupposes or is founded upon a faith in human reason, as 
the Court has often said.
<P>

I think that one could stretch this a bit further and say that the 
purpose of the First Amendment is to provide people, through open 
discussion and through works of literature and art, with the opportunity 
to explore not only what is true, but also what is good and what is 
beautiful.  Nonetheless, all of these forms of expression are subject to 
rational judgment.

<center>
<h3>Drawing the Line</h3>
</center>

It may be true that works of literature and art are primarily appeals 
to the imagination and to emotion rather than to reason.  I don't quite 
agree with that opinion, because I think it relies upon a very narrow 
conception of reason.  But let's assume that it's true:  Even if a work of 
literature or art is primarily an appeal to imagination and to emotion, 
nonetheless, reason can judge what emotion is being appealed to.  We 
can look at an alleged work of art and determine whether it appeals to a 
love of beauty, to the appreciation of human good and evil, to the 
vicarious enjoyment of adventure, to the desire for a good belly laugh, 
to sexual lust, or to a sick appetite for violence.  
<P>

I am suggesting here that there are various levels and kinds of 
speech, and that reason can make judgments that distinguish them.  The 
Supreme Court, I think, agreed with this in the 1957 case of Roth v. 
U.S., when it laid down a norm for judging what is legally obscene-and 
thus constitutionally unprotected.  The test is "whether to the average 
person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant 
theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest."   
Clearly the court assumes here that the average person can judge 
this, at least in the case where the appeal to prurient interest goes far 
enough.  There will always be borderline cases; in these we should 
favor freedom.  But sometimes there isn't any real doubt.  
<P>

In 1973, in Miller v. California, the Supreme Court said that courts 
can distinguish commerce in ideas, which is protected by the First 
Amendment, from commercial exploitation of obscene material.  
Indeed, it went on to say, courts must make this distinction, because "to 
equate the free and robust exchange of ideas and political debate with 
commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand 
conception of the First Amendment and its high purposes."   So, then, 
there are purposes in the First Amendment, and some of them, at least, 
are high.  The First Amendment doesn't protect all speech simply 
because it is speech, any more than freedom protects all action simply 
because it is action.  We must always ask, what kind of action?  Who is 
doing what?  And-as they say-to whom?
<P>

In a companion case, decided the same day as Miller v. California, 
the Court held that legislatures as well as courts can distinguish 
between protected and unprotected expression:
<P>

<blockquote>
The sum of experience affords an ample basis for legisla-
tures to conclude that a sensitive, key relationship of hu-
man existence, central to family life, community welfare, 
and the development of human personality, can be 
debased and distorted by crass commercial exploitation of 
sex. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Furthermore-and this is very important-the Court said: "Nothing in 
the Constitution prohibits a State from reaching such a conclusion and 
acting on it legislatively simply because there is no conclusive 
evidence or empirical data."   After all, the Court pointed out, 
legislatures have acted in many fields on indemonstrable premises, yet 
the Supreme Court has upheld their legislation.
<P>

It is utter flimflammery to insist that we have to get social scientists 
to prove that, for instance, pornography does harm.  Independently of 
any proof of harm that certain types of expression do, we can recognize 
these types as being at best worthless, and therefore not worth 
protecting.  Any rational ground for thinking that they do some harm is 
sufficient for prohibiting them.  

<center>
<h3>Answering the Absolutists</h3>
</center>

Needless to say, there is an absolutist response to all this, which it 
seems to me is reducible to two arguments.  The first is what I call the 
"pearl in the garage" argument, the argument that every expression, as 
long as it is an expression, contains (or at least may for all we know 
contain) something of value of which society would not be deprived; 
and that we should be willing to wade through an ocean of garbage to 
find it.  
<P>

I believe it is an adequate answer to this remarkable argument to 
say: "We know there is an ocean of garbage, but we do not know that 
there is a pearl in it; and even if there is a pearl, we do not know that it 
is a pearl of such great price that it is worth wading through an ocean 
of garbage to get it.  Nor do we know that we have to wade through 
this ocean of garbage to find this particular pearl, for it may be a 
thought that occurred to somebody else who was able to express it 
without burying it in an ocean of garbage."
<P>

Faced with this line of reasoning, the absolutists tend to fall back 
upon the argument of John Stuart Mill in his essay On Liberty.  The 
risks involved in allowing any limitation of expression are always 
greater than the risks involved in guaranteeing an unlimited freedom of 
speech.  To guarantee an absolutely unlimited freedom of expression 
will doubtless result in some harm, but it will always be less harm than 
is done by allowing any limitation at all upon expression.   
<P>

To hold this view requires an ideological, doctrinaire mentality-a 
mentality for which the needle on the gauge always stands either at 
zero degrees or at 180 degrees.  Yet I submit that legislation-a balance, 
as Edmund Burke said, sometimes between good and good, sometimes 
between good and evil, and sometimes even between evil and 
evil-practically always corresponds with one of the 179 degrees 
between zero and 180.
<P>

It is only the doctrinaire mentality that can insist we either 
guarantee Fanny Hill or else join the Spanish Inquisition, there being 
no middle ground.  Or that if we ban the raunchiest of X-rated films, 
we will undoubtedly end up banning Shakespeare and the Bible.  Or, as 
one noted civil libertarian has suggested, that if we allow any limitation 
whatsoever on freedom of expression, we will end up burning witches, 
as they did in 17th-century Massachusetts.
<P>

There is no reason to accept these arguments.  The whole history of 
literature contradicts them.  Take, for example, the names of 
Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Moliere, Goethe, and Dostoyevsky.  
Not one of these writers lived in a regime of unlimited freedom of 
expression.  Not one of them, for that matter, lived in a liberal 
democracy.  And yet critics have compared their writings favorably 
with the very best work of Ernest Hemingway and Norman Mailer.  
Consider the history of our own country.  A regime of unlimited 
freedom of expression came in only in the 1960s.  Do we know, or 
have we any reason to believe, that American arts and letters were 
stifled before that time?  Or that we are producing better arts and letters 
today than we did prior to 1965?
<P>

I can remember when Fiorello La Guardia was the mayor of New 
York, and drove the burlesque shows and the striptease joints out of the 
city.  He simply refused to renew their licenses, and they didn't come 
back until after John Lindsay was elected mayor in 1965.  Yet the La 
Guardia years were the golden years of the Broadway musical, the 
years when we had the great shows-Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King 
and I, My Fair Lady, and so forth.  There is no ground on which 
anyone can prove that banning pornography harmed Broadway.  And I 
would say that that's true of literature generally.
<P>

All of these absolutist arguments rest upon a profound mistrust of 
the ability of average human beings to make prudent practical 
judgments.  Granted, if we let the public decide, sometimes it will go 
too far and will be too restrictive.  Sometimes.  But there is nothing that 
gives us any reason to believe that the American public is a bunch of 
frustrated Puritans held back only by the strong arm of the American 
Civil Liberties Union.
<P>

Furthermore, I think the type of arguments that are used for 
absolute freedom of speech and press undermine these freedoms in the 
long run.  Absolutists say that we have no standards by which we can 
distinguish the purposes of expression, or judge what kinds of 
expression-however coarse they may be-make at least some 
contribution to our progress.  But if we go far enough along that line, 
we will wind up wondering why the freedoms of speech and press are 
worth protecting at all.  As Walter Lippmann wrote in The Public 
Philosophy, "freedom to speak and think are not self-evident 
necessities.  It is only from the hope and the intention of discovering 
truth that freedom acquires such high public significance."  But, he 
warned, 
<P>

<blockquote>
when the chaff of silliness, baseness, and deception is so 
voluminous that it submerges the kernels of truth, freedom 
of speech may produce such frivolity, or such mischief, 
that it cannot be preserved against the demand for a 
restoration of order or of decency.  If there is a dividing 
line between liberty and license, it is where freedom of 
speech is no longer respected as a procedure of the truth 
and becomes the unrestricted right to exploit the ignorance, and to incite the passions, of the people  Then freedom is such a hullabaloo of sophistry, propaganda, special 
pleading, lobbying, and salesmanship that it is difficult to 
remember why freedom of speech is worth the pain and 
trouble of defending it.
</blockquote>

<center>
<h3>Practical Steps Against Pornography</h3>
</center>

So far I have argued only that the First Amendment does not bar all 
regulation of expression, and that obscenity is not constitutionally 
protected.  The practical question of what kind of regulation citizens 
can advocate with any hope of having it accepted is a more difficult 
one.  Such citizen-advocates are up against a deep-seated prejudice in 
the minds of many Americans, who may not know much about the 
Constitution, but are convinced that the First Amendment guarantees 
everyone's absolute right to say, hear, read, and view whatever he 
pleases.  This conviction has been fostered in their minds by liberal 
academics, journalists, and entertainers, all of whom have an obvious 
interest in it.  It is now the prevailing orthodoxy in the law schools, and 
has heavily influenced the courts.
<P>

The odds are therefore against the success of efforts to restrict the 
production and dissemination of pornography, but they are not 
hopelessly great.  Concerned citizens should make such efforts, but 
with care and caution.  The first piece of advice that I would offer is: 
don't go for the gold.  Do not seek sweeping pieces of legislation that 
ban everything that someone finds pornographic.  Begin with the hard-
core stuff that is clearly pornographic.  
<P>

On the other hand, the purpose should be to ban the sale of 
pornography, not merely to keep porn shops and movie houses a 
certain distance from schools and churches.  If the freedom of speech 
absolutists fear that they may not be able to prevent some restriction of 
pornography, they will offer that sort of "compromise."  It should not 
be accepted!  Acceptance would imply that pornography, no matter 
how raw, is protected by the First Amendment and is, at most, subject 
to regulation of where it may be sold.  
<P>

A proposed ordinance offered to a city council or state legislature 
should clearly specify what it intends to prohibit, in language that the 
courts will find hard to declare unconstitutional on the ground that it is 
"vague and overbroad."  The courts hold, reasonably enough, that the 
law may not punish a man for violating the law, when it did not tell 
him clearly what it forbade him to do.  Some judges, of course, will 
find any law vague and overbroad that puts any limits on "expression," 
but we should not play into their hands by using loose legal language.
<P>

A proposed ordinance should also be accompanied by a well-
thought out statement of reasons for restricting the sale of this kind of 
pornography.  It need not and should not seek to prove that 
pornography has done direct, tangible, assignable harm to individuals, 
or has been the cause of crimes committed by particular persons.  A 
rational case, however, which abstains from off-putting moralistic 
language, can be made for the connection between the material sought 
to be banned and harm to society, along the lines of Miller v. 
California.  This case will support the constitutionality of the proposed 
legislation.  
<P>

Finally, the citizen group or groups sponsoring the legislation will 
have to take steps to arouse public opinion and win public support for 
the ordinance.  That will require a certain amount of leg work.  
If that sounds like a big order, well, it is.  But it can be done by 
dedicated people who are willing to put time, effort and money into it.  
They should seek advice from organizations that have long been active 
in the fight against pornography and know what can succeed and what 
will likely fail.  Among such organizations are:
<P>

</blockquote>

<P>
If possible, the proponents of an anti-pornography ordinance should 
ask the help of a good lawyer who is on their side and believes in their 
cause-perhaps a friendly law school professor who is well versed in the 
constitutional law of speech and press.  
<P>

The citizen group, therefore, should survey the field, seek advice on 
where to get the kind of lawyer or lawyers that it needs, and carefully 
choose the place in which to seek the desired legislation.  It would not 
be wise to begin with New York or San Francisco.  Better to pick a city 
or a state where victory is possible, and the local courts are likely to 
sustain the legislation.  From that point on, as George Washington said 
in his Farewell Address, let us raise a standard to which the wise and 
the good may repair; the event is in the hands of God.

<h1>Homosexuality,<BR>
Public Health, and Civil Rights</h1>

<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Daniel C. Palm</h3>


The 1972 Gay Rights Platform1 contained the following demands:
<P>

<ul>
<LI>Amend all federal Civil Rights Acts, other legislation and government 
controls to prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, public 
accommodations and public services.

<LI>A presidential order prohibiting the military from excluding for reasons of their sexual orientation, persons who of their own volition desire entrance into the Armed Services; and from issuing less than fully-honorable discharges for homosexuality; and the upgrading to fully honorable all such discharges previously issued, with retroactive benefits.

<LI>A presidential order prohibiting discrimination in the federal civil service because of sexual orientation, in hiring and promoting; and prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in security clearances.

<LI>Elimination of tax inequities [favoring traditional families].

<LI>Elimination of bars to the entry, immigration and naturalization of homosexual aliens.

<LI>Federal encouragement and support for sex education courses, prepared and taught by [homosexuals], presenting homosexuality as a valid, healthy preference and . . . a viable alternative to heterosexuality.

<LI>Federal funding of aid programs of [homosexual] organizations designed to alleviate the problems encountered by [homosexuals].

</ul>

The document made similar demands of states, including:
<P>

<ul>

<LI>Repeal of all state laws prohibiting solicitation for private voluntary sexual liaisons; and laws prohibiting prostitution, both male and female.

<LI>[L]egislation prohibiting insurance companies and any other state-regulated enterprises from discriminating because of sexual orientation, in insurance and in bonding or any other prerequisite to employment or control of one's personal demesne.

<LI>[L]egislation so that child custody, adoption, visitation rights, foster parenting, and the like shall not be denied because of sexual orientation or marital status.

<LI>Repeal of all laws prohibiting transvestism and cross dressing.

<LI>Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.

<LI>Repeal of all legislative provisions that restrict the sex or number of persons entering into a marriage unit; and the extension of legal benefits to all persons who cohabit regardless of sex or numbers.
</ul>
<P>

Two decades later, especially at the federal level, most of these demands have been met.  Nor do signs look good for  a quick reversal of this trend:  The descriptive word "homosexual" has been replaced by the perfectly nondescriptive word "gay."  Opponents of homosexuality are said to be afflicted with "homophobia."  The media and academic elites are actively supporting the organized homosexual line.  Politicians routinely court the "homosexual vote" in the same way they court, for example, the votes of farmers.  "The love that dare not speak its name" is fast becoming "the love that no one dares to question."
<P>

Defenders of morality have a tough row to hoe.  They must begin by sensibly recasting the terms of the debate.  This means, first, addressing sex-related diseases as health issues rather than civil rights issues.  Second, it means distinguishing the civil rights of all Americans under the Constitution from the special rights demanded by organized homosexuals.  
<h3>Homosexuality and the Public Health</h3>

While AIDS has destroyed the lives of non-homosexuals through intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, or promiscuity, until recently the disease has been primarily spread among homosexuals.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control reports that 64 percent of all adult/adolescent AIDS cases and 79 percent of AIDS cases among Caucasians in the U.S. were acquired through homosexual contact.  Ninety-one percent of American AIDS cases have been traced to homosexual sex, intravenous drug use, or some combination of the two.2
<P>

Homosexuals also continue to contract and spread other diseases at rates significantly higher than the community at large.  These include syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis A and B, a variety of intestinal parasites including amebiasis and giardiasis, and even typhoid fever.3  This is because rectal intercourse or sodomy, typically practiced by homosexuals, is one of the most efficient methods of transmitting disease.  Why?  Because nature designed the human rectum for a single purpose: expelling waste from the body.  It is built of a thin layer of columnar cells, different in structure than the plate cells that line the female reproductive tract.  Because the wall of the rectum is so thin, it is easily ruptured during anal intercourse, allowing semen, blood, feces, and saliva to directly enter the bloodstream.  The chances for infection increase further when multiple partners are involved, as is frequently the case:  Surveys indicate that American male homosexuals average between 10 and 110 sex partners per year.4  
<P>

Not surprisingly, these diseases shorten life expectancy.  Social psychologist Paul Cameron compared over 6,200 obituaries from homosexual magazines and tabloids to a comparable number of obituaries from major American newspapers.  He found that while the median age of death of married American males was 75, for sexually active homo-sexual American males it was 42.  For homosexual males infected with the AIDS virus, it was 39.  While 80 percent of married American men lived to 65 or older, less than two percent of the homosexual men covered in the survey lived as long.5
<P>
 
In the face of these facts, it is reprehensible that Americans, and especially American schoolchildren, are being told today that homosexual behavior can be safe.  Condoms are no god-send:  estimates of condom failure run from 15.7 to as high as 44 percent.  Breakage is even more likely with rectal intercourse, where the wear and tear on condoms is obviously greater.  
<P>

Because smokers don't live as long as non-smokers, society considers smoking harmful and discourages the use of tobacco.  By the same logic, aren't homosexual practices deserving of social disapproval?  
<h3>Civil Rights and Special Rights</h3>
The gay rights movement's main rhetorical ploy is to liken itself to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s.  The extent to which this line is successful reflects a confusion about the meaning of "rights" in the public mind.  
<P>

The charter of American liberty, the Declaration of Independence, explains that human beings are born with "certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  These rights belong to people equally.  No human being is so superior to another that he may treat the other as he would treat an irrational beast.  This is the argument that Abraham Lincoln hearkened back to during the Civil War, and Martin Luther King, Jr. during the 1960s.  Unlike people in most countries, Americans have been able to enjoy these rights, because the American Constitution sets up a government that is limited in what it can do.  
<P>

Consider the claimed comparison between the gay rights movement and the civil rights movement in light of this.  An obvious difference is that the former is centered around a type of behavior, namely sodomy.  Is there a constitutional right to sodomy which can be deduced from our equal natural rights, such as there is, say, to practice our religion or speak our mind?  No.  
<P>

At the time of the American founding, and following the tradition of English common law, sodomy was a criminal or common law offense in each of the 13 states.  Until 1961, all 50 states considered sodomy a punishable offense.  It remains illegal today in 23 states and the District of Columbia, and in many of these stands as a felony offense.  At the federal level, the question was dealt with in the Supreme Court's 1986 decision, Bowers v. Hardwick.  The defendants in the case had asked the Court to proclaim, in effect, "a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy."  "This," wrote Justice Byron White in delivering the Court's decision, "we are quite unwilling to do."6  
<P>

More deeply, sodomy is unnatural and, as such, incompatible with any notion of natural rights.  We know that human beings are entitled to their liberty because they are, by nature, capable of reasoning and of choosing.  This is precisely the faculty that identifies a human being, among all the other beings in nature.  We are entitled to civil rights, because we are the one creature equipped by nature to exercise them.
<P>

Human beings also have other aspects to their nature, aspects that are not unique to them and are not such noble features of their makeup.  One is their method of sexual reproduction.  And make no mistake: despite the astonishing denials of organized homosexuality, human beings, as surely as deer or elephants, come equipped with a natural method of reproduction.  Unlike in other species, however, these lower aspects in man share in man's higher aspect, reason.  The result is the virtue of temperence or self-control.  The Founders of America understood that our rights stem from this capacity, the capacity for moral virtue.7  
<P>

Homosexuals like to argue that, since people are by nature free to choose, the choice of sodomy should be protected, at least as much as any other choice.  But the fact that people are free by nature to make choices does not mean that any choice they make is good or that all choices should be equal before the law.  Some people choose to steal and to lie.  Some abandon their children or their wives or husbands. Some sink into the grip of drugs.  Some evade the draft at their country's need, or abandon their duty in the face of battle.  These are bad choices, and when they are made, the rest of us must bear part of the cost.  These things are wrong in a democracy, as much as they are wrong anywhere else.
<P>

On the other hand, liberal societies recognize that all sins cannot be, and must not be, punished under the law.  A state powerful enough to do that is too powerful to control.  That is why we are cautious, in a free country, about telling others what to do.  That is why our presidents often appeal to us to be upright, moral citizens, but they do not bring charges against us unless we break the law. 
<P>

Still we must not forget that democracies have the greatest interest in the practice of virtue by citizens, because in democracy the citizens themselves are the rulers.  So it is that George Washington, one of the greatest moral examples in history, said in his First Inaugural Address: "there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness . . ."  
<P>

A liberal society might, then, find it prudent to ignore homosexuality.  It might well deem it unwise to peer into private bedrooms.  But this is not the issue before us.  Today the demand is not that people be allowed their privacy.  The demand is that homosexuality be endorsed and promoted with the full power of the law.  This would require us to abandon the standard of nature, the one standard that can teach us the difference between freedom and slavery, between right and wrong. 
<P>

Once we abandon the standard of nature, what is to forbid us from resorting to any violation of nature that we may please?  Why should we not return to slavery, if we find it convenient?  Or the practices of incest or adultery or cannibalism?  Without an understanding that there is a higher law that limits human will-whether divine law or a "law of Nature and Nature's God" which we can grasp through our reason-there is no basis to prohibit any activity.  Anything becomes permissible.
<P>

In fact, the rights sought by homosexual activists are not natural or constitutional rights.  They are the special rights granted ethnic minorities by affirmative action policies.  These special rights would force businesses, schools, and virtually every institution in the land, public and private, to open their doors to homosexuals, and allow lawsuits to be brought against those that refuse.  
<P>

To be considered a specially-protected minority under the law, a group must meet several tests, as determined by a series of Supreme Court decisions.  Its members must be identifiable by an unchanging physical condition-e.g., skin color, gender, handicap.  They must be able to demonstrate that they have suffered discrimination to the extent that they are unable to earn an average income, receive an adequate education, or enjoy a fulfilling cultural life.  And they must show that their members are politically powerless to change their predicament.8 
<P>

To date, the homosexual lobby has been unable to prove that its members meet these requirements.  There is no evidence-statistical or otherwise-that homosexuals are suffering any practical or political disadvantages.  They have never been denied the right to vote or other constitutional rights, nor have they suffered segregation under the law, nor have they been denied access to public facilities.  Several U.S. Congressmen, Senators, and prominent state legislators are openly homosexual, as are high-level members of present and recent presidential administrations.  Statistically, homosexuals enjoy higher economic standards than average Americans.9   Any claim to political powerlessness is belied by how politicians today-especially Democratic politicians-court the "homosexual vote."  
<P>

It is easy to see the difference between civil and constitutional rights and the special rights sought by homosexuals by considering the controversy over "gays" in the military.  First: there is no civil right to join the military.  People are refused entrance for numerous reasons, e.g., age, intelligence, physical handicap, criminal record.  Second: the racial integration of the armed forces (to which proponents of "sexual preference integration" like to point) was part of the proper expansion of constitutional rights because race was an irrational (hence unconstitutional) basis of discrimination.  Those who thought blacks were different in behavior were simply prejudiced-they were wrong.  Those who think homosexuals behave differently are self-evidently right.  The word "homosexual," unlike the words "black" or "brown" or "yellow," denotes precisely a different behavior.  In this case, those who deny a difference are being irrational.  
<P>

As summed up by a veteran of the civil rights movement: "The road to Selma was not the road to Sodom."
Near-term Measures
There is no indication that the Supreme Court will strike down the remaining state anti-sodomy laws.  Thus the organized homosexual offensive operates primarily in two areas:  incorporating homosexual propaganda into public school curricula and promoting special "anti-discrimination laws" in states and cities.
<P>

In combatting this offensive, generally speaking, debates about Biblical doctrine, the percentage of the homosexual population, or whether homosexuality is genetic or psychological in origin, are fruitless and allow homosexual activists to obscure the main points on which the political battles will be won or lost: public health and civil rights.10  
  Champions of morality should really go on the offensive themselves on the issue of homosexuality as a public health hazard.  A good place to do so is before the governing boards of public schools, where homosexuality (when practiced "safely") is often presented as an acceptable alternate lifestyle.  The principle of the matter is simple: Parents must not tolerate anyone in a position of authority telling their children that anal intercourse is acceptable or can be safe.  
<P>

The public must be educated to the fact that homosexuality is associated with higher rates of disease, and why.  Then it must be mobilized to force the hand of school boards and state education commissions either to teach the benefits of traditional morality or to leave the job of sex education to families.
<P>

The best recent example of this sort of offensive campaign is the toppling of New York City's Chancellor Joseph Fernandez by an outraged public mobilized by a retired public school teacher from Brooklyn.  Parents became incensed when they learned that the curriculum (entitled "Children of the Rainbow") portrayed homosexuality in a favorable light to children as young as eleven years. 11  
<P>

As for defense: A successful campaign against giving special rights to homosexuals was waged in Colorado in 1992.12  Citizens were convinced to prohibit laws and ordinances requiring them to hire and accept homosexuals as tenants, teachers, employees, day-care providers, health care workers, ministers, etc.  They were convinced primarily by arguments about fairness and equity.  Pro-Amendment 2 campaign literature (often presented in myth/fact format) argued that while homosexuals ought to enjoy the same constitutional rights as other Americans, they ought not be granted rights and privileges above and beyond the rights of others.  

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The case against organized homosexuality is twofold.  First, nature rewards healthy living habits with good health.  It is abundantly clear that homosexual behavior is unnatural and unhealthy, and it is odd that such behavior is applauded in an age that worships nature and bodily good health, even to the exclusion of other good things.
<P>

Secondly, Americans are exceedingly tolerant.  They are not as a rule inclined to dig around in each others' private lives.  But they still believe that there is right and wrong.  They reject the absurd claim that the constitutional principle of equality before the law means that all behavior, no matter how heinous, is equally okay.  And on the basis of this distinction, they can be mobilized against laws that give homosexuals special legal standing to bully the rest of us.

<h1>Turning the Tide on Abortion</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Glen E. Thurow</h3>

Family life was quite sturdy in America until the 1960s.  For one 
thing, the family had the support of the law.  Laws were designed to 
promote a strong sense of responsibility to one's family and country.  
This responsibility has been undermined by the laws passed since the 
sexual revolution and the launching of the welfare state in the 1960s.  
One of the most dramatic changes along these lines was the 1973 
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
<P>

America now has the most liberal abortion laws in the world.  Over 
1.5 million abortions take place here every year.   This is not solely an 
"underclass" phenomenon, as many seem to believe.  Abortion is 
prevalent among middle-class and upper-class young girls who, in 
effect, use this procedure as a form of birth control.   No other fact, 
perhaps, more graphically illustrates our delining moral sense and 
increasing confusion of constitutional liberty with personal license.

<center>
<h3>Abortion and Slavery</h3>
</center>

Today's abortion controversy is similar in a couple of instructive 
ways to the slavery controversy of the 1850s.  In both controversies, 
the fundamental issue for Americans was and is the meaning of the 
claim of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created 
equal" and possess "unalienable rights" that include "life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness."  Who is included in the "men" who are 
created equal?  The pro-slavery forces said that Negroes were not 
created equal, and today's pro-abortion forces say that babies who are 
still in their mother's wombs are not included.
<P>

The constitutional and political arguments are similar as well.  The 
pro-abortion forces have succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to 
endorse their views and to impose them on the other branches of 
government and the people.  In the 1854 case of Dred Scott v. Sanford, 
the Court held that Negroes were not "men" and had no rights 
enforceable by federal courts.  In the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade, the 
Court held that unborn children were not "persons" and therefore have 
no constitutional rights.
<P>

Both cases held that a part of the human race have no rights; both 
also claimed that the government has no power to extend protections to 
the disfavored groups even should the people desire to do so.  The 
Dred Scott majority held that the government had no power to prohibit 
slavery in the hitherto free territories of the United States, and Roe held 
that no government could prohibit or even substantially restrict the 
killing of the unborn.  There is a constitutional right to make a black 
man one's slave in federal territory, proclaimed the Court in 1854; there 
is a constitutional right to kill the unborn, proclaims the contemporary 
Court.

<center>
<h3>Corruption of the Moral Sense</h3>
</center>

Our sense of right and wrong depends upon our recognition of our 
common humanity-the recognition that there is no inequality among us 
that entitles one person arbitrarily to kill or enslave or otherwise 
mistreat another human being.  In both the cases of slavery and 
abortion, the country's highest and most revered legal authority has 
tried to erase from the American conscience the awareness of the 
common humanity that binds us to another part of the human race.
This has proved to be a harder task to accomplish than the judges 
thought.  It is not easy to erase our natural sense of justice towards our 
fellow human beings.  Abraham Lincoln noted that the injustice of 
slavery was 
<P>

<blockquote>
so plain that no one, high or low, ever does mistake it, 
except in a plainly selfish way; for although volume upon 
volume is written to prove slavery a very good thing, we 
never hear of the man who wishes to take the good of it, 
by <i>being a slave himself</i>.
</blockquote>

<P>
Just as it was impossible for even slaveholders to consistently deny that 
the Negro slave was an human being, so it is difficult to deny that the 
unborn child is human.  Thus except for a small minority, even 
abortion-rights supporters, to some extent or another, are shocked by 
the large numbers of abortions performed each year.
<P>

After all, what is the growth in the womb if not a human baby?  It is 
certainly not some other kind of animal.  Nor is it simply part of the 
mother.  If it were, we would treat it like other parts of the human 
body: we do not allow people to remove their livers or appendices just 
because they feel like it, but only if such organs are diseased and 
therefore dangerous to the person's general health.  Is it then a tumor, a 
diseased growth within the human body?  Of course not.  It is a 
developing and growing baby-weak, dependent, perhaps not yet able to 
breathe if separated from his or her mother-but undeniably human.
Just as people had to steel themselves not to see the humanity in the 
slave baby, so people today must hide the humanity of the unborn baby 
from themselves in order to believe that it is proper to kill him or her.  
Our natural feeling of connection with the growing baby in the 
mother's womb has to be destroyed.  
<P>

The abortion movement has developed an elaborate language of 
euphemisms to hide reality.  As people called African-Americans such 
derisive terms as "nigger" in order to deny their full humanity, today 
the flesh in the mother's womb is a "fetus," never an "unborn child."  
"It" is only "potential life," as though nothing has to be killed in order 
to perform an abortion.  An abortion is only a "medical procedure" like 
any other medical procedure, as though it were an operation designed 
to restore health rather than to kill a growing baby.  The movement is 
the "pro-choice" movement, not the "pro-abortion" movement, as 
though there were some other choice than the choice to have an 
abortion at stake.
<P>

Even the word "abortion" hides what is being aborted.  Until 
recently a very common colloquial expression when a medically 
necessary abortion was performed was to say "they had to 'take the 
baby'," implying both taking the baby out of the mother's womb and 
taking the life of a human baby.  This delicate but revealing and honest 
speech has been replaced by antiseptic euphemisms that subtly but 
effectively erode and neutralize our moral sense.  
<P>

But this deadening of the moral sense with respect to the unborn 
child does not stop there.  If, in being honest with ourselves, we cannot 
deny that the growing fetus is a growing human being, where do we 
draw the line between this human being and other human beings such 
that we have the right to kill this one, but not the others?  Is it because 
the unborn child is weak and dependent?  Then do we have the right to 
kill the old, or those who are sick, or those who require apparatus to 
assist their breathing?  Is it because the baby in the womb cannot think 
or is not fully developed?  Then do we have the right to kill post-natal 
babies?  Is it because we think the unborn cannot feel pain?  Then do 
we have the right to kill those to whom we first administer pain-killers?
As Abraham Lincoln once memorably said, "You say A is white 
and B is black.  It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave 
the darker?  Take care.  By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man 
you meet with a fairer skin than your own."   Any argument that could 
be used to justify Negro enslavement would also justify the 
enslavement of at least some white men.  So, too, the killing unleashed 
by the opinion that it is proper to kill the unborn cannot permanently be 
restricted to the unborn because the same arguments justify killing at 
least some other human beings-the sick, the old, the dependent, or the 
inconvenient.  

<center>
<h3>Corruption of the Political Sense</h3>
</center>

Roe v. Wade also corrupts the Constitution and our understanding 
of it.  Like Dred Scott, which found a ringing defense of slavery in a 
document that does not even mention slavery, so Roe found a right of 
abortion, based upon a right of privacy, in a document that mentions 
neither abortion nor privacy.  Nor does Roe simply make an error in the 
way in which it reads the Constitution; it relies upon a view of the 
Constitution that destroys the authority of the people and the rule of 
law that are at the heart of constitutional government.
<P>

In the great case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice John 
Marshall stated the principles of American constitutional government 
in their classic form.  He noted that the Constitution's authority rested 
on the "original right" of the people "to establish, for the future 
government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to 
their own happiness."  These principles are "fundamental" and are 
"designed to be permanent." 
<P>

The American Constitution established a government of limited 
powers, reserving the remaining powers to the states or the people.  It 
required a government of laws and is itself, as the "supreme law," the 
crowning part of the rule of law, binding and controlling all other acts 
and laws.  As Marshall put it, "The distinction between a government 
with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not 
confine the persons on whom they are imposed."  This power was to be 
enforced by impartial judges.  But those judges themselves were to be 
limited by being subordinate to the Constitution.  "The framers of the 
Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government 
of courts, as well as of the legislature."   This means that it is the duty 
of judges to discern what was intended by any provision of the 
Constitution and to make their rulings in accordance with those 
intentions, rather than in accordance with their own desires and 
preferences.
<P>

These principles-the fundamental authority of the people, the rule 
of law, and the subordination of judges as well as others to the 
Constitution-are all undermined by Roe v. Wade.  Instead of a set of 
principles or laws, whose intended meaning can be found by judges 
and to which they must conform, the Constitution is regarded by the 
Court in Roe as a collection of vague clauses which suggest principles 
to judges that have nothing to do with the Framers' intentions.  Roe 
relies upon a "right of privacy" to prohibit laws restricting abortion.  
But this "right" is nowhere explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  
Nor is there any clause to which it can be clearly attached.
<P>
The Court suggests, not that the "right" itself, but that its "roots" can 
be found in various constitutional provisions.  But even the location of 
the "roots" is extremely vague.  The roots may be found, for example, 
in "penumbras" of the Bill of Rights (as though there were ghosts 
walking through the Constitution visible only to judges).  While citing 
the Fourth Amendment as possible authority for its decision, the Court 
does not bother even to try to show how it could be reasonable to think 
that the American people, in prohibiting unreasonable searches and 
seizures, intended to prohibit laws regulating abortions.  In spite of its 
own confessed inability to say where the right of privacy is even 
"rooted," the Court nevertheless considered itself free to rule that this 
right "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or 
not to terminate her pregnancy," and thereby to take this vital moral 
question out of the hands of a self governing people and place it in 
those of nine judges.
<P>

While hiding behind a facade of being faithful to the Constitution, 
such reasoning almost entirely frees judges from the constraints of the 
Constitution.  They simply declare their own preferences to be the 
"supreme Law of the Land."  When its guardians are freed from its 
rule, the rule of law itself is destroyed, and what passes as "law" is in 
fact only the particular preferences of judges.  The authority of the 
Constitution disappears and, along with it, the authority of the people 
as well.  
<P>

The people's authority in our political order is expressed both in the 
Constitution itself, and in the laws and acts made by the people's 
elected representatives.  But when the judges sweep the Constitution 
aside in favor of their own preferences, and prohibit the people from 
making laws through their legislatures that might oppose those 
preferences, then the people's authority and self government ceases.  As 
Lincoln said in his First Inaugural Address:
<P>

<blockquote>
[I]f the policy of the government, upon vital questions, 
affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by 
decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, 
in ordinary litigation between parties, in personal actions, 
the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having 
to that extent, practically resigned their government, into 
the hands of that eminent tribunal. 
</blockquote>

<center>
<h3>Answering Pro-Abortion Arguments</h3>
</center>

Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's opponent in the Lincoln-Douglas 
debates, maintained that the issue raised by the slavery controversy was 
not the rightness or wrongness of slavery, but the right of people in the 
states to choose for themselves whether to have slavery or not.  
"Choice" (or "popular sovereignty" as Douglas called it) was the 
issue.   The parallel today is obvious; many people who support 
unrestricted abortions even go so far as to say that they personally 
oppose abortion but believe it is the right of the mother to choose for 
herself whether to kill the infant or not.  Like Douglas, they say that the 
issue is free choice.  Also like Douglas, they claim that those on the 
other side are fanatics (Black Republicans, Douglas liked to call them) 
who want to impose their own beliefs and destroy free choice.
<p>

To this argument Lincoln replied that this would be true were slaves 
not men.  There are certain things people do not have a right to choose, 
and one of them is to make another man their slave, for our own 
freedom to choose rests upon our being human.  Freedom is not 
restricted by prohibiting slavery; it is enlarged, for freedom cannot be 
secure without the recognition that other men are equally entitled to be 
free.
<P>

Similarly the argument that what is at stake in the abortion 
controversy is the freedom or choice of the mother rests on the premise 
that the unborn child is not human.  It does not enlarge freedom for one 
human being to be legally entitled to choose to kill another; it restricts 
freedom because it says, as even the majority in Roe v. Wade 
recognized, that some group has no rights.  The fundamental issue is 
not choice but whether the unborn child is human and therefore 
whether it is right or wrong to kill him or her.
<P>

A second argument made to obscure the moral question is that the 
only grounds for believing that the unborn is human is religious 
conviction, and that our belief in religious freedom requires us to keep 
religious opinions from influencing public policy and law.  Both of 
these contentions are false.  
<P>

As suggested above, not only religious conviction, but common 
sense suggests that the fetus is a growing and developing human being.  
It is as obvious as it is that both blacks and whites belong to the same 
human race.  Some say that science cannot tell us when human life 
begins.  But this argument uses the tendency of science to see the 
development of life as a continuum to obscure what no medical 
scientist would deny.  Contrary to the implications of this argument, 
medical science is perfectly able to distinguish a growing baby from a 
tumor or an organ, and knows with certainty that from the time of the 
union and implantation of egg and sperm a human being and not some 
other creature is developing.
<P>

Furthermore, even insofar as the view that a fetus is human 
coincides with religious teachings, it is perfectly legitimate for it to 
influence the law.  To think otherwise is to grossly misunderstand and 
pervert the meaning of religious freedom; it would say that only 
atheists have a right to influence public policy.  The First Amendment 
is not a grant of the government's power to atheists and an exclusion of 
religious people, but a guarantee that people are free to worship God in 
the way they choose.  As long as the opinions one gains from one's 
religion do not infringe on the right of others to worship God in a 
different way, those opinions can properly influence public policy and 
law.  Indeed, at the heart of the American experiment is a religious 
opinion that all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights."  To remove religious opinions from our public life 
would be to destroy the fundamental conviction that lies at the heart of 
our country.

<center>
<h3>Molding Public Sentiment </h3>
</center>

In resisting slavery advocates, Lincoln always kept the central 
objective closely in mind.  That objective was to restore the nation to 
the principle that all men are created equal by making the opinion that 
slavery was wrong the ruling opinion of the country.  As he put it, "He 
who molds public sentiment goes deeper that he who enacts statutes 
and pronounces decisions.  He makes statutes or decisions possible or 
impossible to execute."   The central task today is to reestablish in our 
public opinion the conviction that the unborn child is entitled to the 
right to life that we grant to other human beings.  If that conviction is 
present, no court or other obstacle can long stand in its way.
<P>

There may be a tendency to look at the current political situation 
and despair over the issue of abortion.  Pro-abortion forces seem to be 
gaining strength.  The current President not only does not want to use 
the law to restrict abortion, but favors promoting abortion as a means 
of birth control at least in foreign countries and to some extent in ours.  
<P>

The Supreme Court has yet to overturn Roe v. Wade and is not likely to 
do so in the near future, especially with the current likelihood that new 
judges who are committed to it will be appointed to the Court.  Only 
the Congress remains something of a question mark, but its anti-
abortion majority of a few years ago is no longer in control.
But this is no reason to lose heart.  The democratic mechanism of 
elections ensure that the people may bring about change when the 
government goes astray.  In order to accomplish such a task today, 
opponents of abortion must work to persuade people of the justice of 
the cause.  And they must be willing to unite with all those who would 
move the country in the direction of reinstating the opinion that 
abortion is a bad thing to be avoided rather than a good thing to be 
encouraged.
<P>

To persuade as many people as possible of the justice of their cause 
requires three things: the first is to lay the foundations of the pro-life 
argument on the widest possible basis.  The central task is to restore the 
conviction among Americans that it is wrong to kill unborn children.  
What exceptions there might be to this rule is a secondary issue best 
decided at this point on the basis of what will attract the largest number 
of people.  Once people are convinced that killing the unborn is bad, 
they can be trusted to make a reasonable judgment about what 
exceptions might be good or tolerable.
<P>

The second thing required is to recognize and acknowledge the 
right of people to make up their own minds on this issue.  
Demonstrations are useful to call the issue to people's attention, but 
force, threats, or intimidation do not persuade.  Moral reformation 
comes from the heart and cannot simply be compelled.  Again, as 
Lincoln said so well, 
<P>

<blockquote>
When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, 
persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be 
adopted.  It is an old and a true maxim, that a 'drop of 
honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' 
</blockquote>

<P>
Third, pro-lifers must understand and present their cause as part of 
a larger cause-the revival of strong families through welfare reform, tax 
reform, education reform, etc.  They must make it clear that they are 
not simply out to save lives but to ensure that the babies they save will 
be brought up in a healthy family environment, and provided with the 
opportunity to prosper that has been America's hallmark.  

<center> 
<h3>Politics and Community Action</h3>
</center>

Thought and reflection are opponents of abortion.  They must be 
fostered both in the individual women who are immediately faced with 
the choice of life and death for their babies, and in society at large.  
Pro-lifers should support private institutions that seek to inform women 
of the alternatives to taking the lives of their babies, and work to bring 
about laws that will encourage time for thought and good advice.  
Parental notification laws, waiting periods, laws requiring that women 
be informed of alternatives to abortion, and similar laws, are all 
permitted under current judicial rulings, and should be promoted in all 
50 states.  Of course, at the same time a majority must be maintained in 
Congress that will oppose laws like the so-called "Freedom of Choice 
Act," which would prevent the states from passing these reasonable 
laws.
<P>

To work to secure passage of these kinds of laws has the additional 
advantage that they are considered eminently reasonable by the 
majority of the American public.  Opposition to these laws is an 
Achilles heel of the pro-abortion movement.  It is clearly irrational to 
oppose laws that simply encourage women to reflect before acting or to 
consult with someone who has a more mature judgment than a young 
girl is likely to have.  In opposing these laws pro-abortion groups 
discredit themselves in the public eye, unmasking their apparent 
concern for the welfare and informed choice of the woman.
<P>

To show this concern themselves, pro-lifers can put the energy now 
put into demonstrating to establish and maintain groups and institutions 
that provide support to pregnant mothers who might be tempted 
otherwise to kill their babies.  Support for groups providing adoption 
services and fostering healthy family lives are needed badly.
It is not possible to predict when the dominant opinion in the 
country can be turned around to actively recognize the common 
humanity of the unborn.  But the day will come if the pro-life 
movement holds firm to America's central principle of human equality, 
and is flexible and tolerant and broadminded in order to attract the 
largest number possible to support a step-by-step revival of the sturdy 
American family.

<h1>The Progressive Income Tax and the Progressive Attack on the Founding</h1>
</center>

<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Edward J. Erler</h3>

The passage of the Sixteenth Amendment (the Income Tax 
Amendment) in 1913 was part of a larger decision by America's 
political and intellectual elites to make sweeping and fundamental 
changes in America.  These changes were calculated to transform the 
limited constitutional government of the Framers into what is today 
called the welfare state.  The principal goal of the welfare state is not 
the protection of the individual rights and liberties of citizens, but the 
promotion of a concept of "social justice" that is alien to the principles 
of the American founding.  What is more, proponents of the welfare 
state believe that individual liberty (i.e., equal opportunity and property 
rights) is incompatible with social justice.

<center>
<h3>The Rise of Class Politics</h3>
</center>

In the same year that the Sixteenth Amendment was passed, Charles 
Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United 
States was published.  This work, in many respects the culminating 
achievement of the Progressive movement, was a thinly veiled Marxist 
analysis of the Constitution.  According to Beard, the Constitution, like 
every other human endeavor, was the product of class struggle.  What 
made the class struggle for the American Constitution different was the 
fact that it was waged largely in secret and by indirection.  Instead of 
viewing the Framers of the Constitution as genuinely public-spirited 
patriots, Beard preferred to see them as members of the propertied elite 
who created the Constitution merely to aggrandize their own class 
interests at the expense of the political rights of the majority.  And 
while the Constitution does not at first glance appear to be an 
"economic document," the "true inwardness of the Constitution" is 
revealed by the "economic interests" of those who framed and 
supported the Constitution. 
<P>

Beard's purpose was "to expose the undemocratic nature of the 
Constitution, to unmask its hidden features in order to show that it 
deserved no veneration, no respect, and should carry no authority to 
democratic Americans of the twentieth century."   The Constitution, 
while presenting a democratic facade, is, in reality, an elaborate scheme 
that allowed predatory minorities (the propertied, the wealthy, the 
holders of public securities, speculators) to dominate and effectively 
disenfranchise the majority.  As another prominent Progressive,     J. 
Allen Smith, noted, "the Constitution was in form a political document, 
but its significance was mainly economic.  It was the outcome of an 
organized movement on the part of a class to surround themselves with 
legal and constitutional guarantees which would check the tendency 
toward democratic legislation."   The Constitution was, in short, an 
oligarchy masquerading as a democracy.
<P>

In the view of the Progressives, one of the more powerful 
institutional devices created by the Framers to prevent majority rule 
was the separation of powers.  Far from being a necessary principle of 
limited government ("an essential precaution in favor of liberty" in 
Madison's terms), separation of powers was portrayed by Beard as 
nothing more than a barrier to democratic rule.  Whereas Hamilton, 
Madison, and the other leading Framers thought that the Supreme 
Court, one of the three separated branches of government, would be an 
independent tribunal serving as the guardian of individual rights and 
liberties, the Progressives argued that the Supreme Court has merely 
served as the guardian of property rights and propertied interests 
against the popular will. 
<P>

This debunking of the Constitution was intended to be a prelude to 
radical reform-a conscious effort to change the Constitution from one 
of limited government to one of unlimited government.  The explicit 
goal of this reform was not the greater protection of rights and liberties 
of individuals, but a newly discovered sense of justice based on the 
redistribution of wealth.  In practical terms it was necessary to reform 
the Constitution to reflect the priority of the welfare of the community 
(or the state) over the rights of individuals.  One lamentable result of 
this project was that Beard and the Progressives made the rhetoric of 
class politics respectable for the first time in American history.  
Although the details of Beard's economic thesis have long ago been 
refuted,  President Clinton's appeal to class envy as the mainstay of 
the welfare state is witness to the fact that the rhetorical power of 
Beard's work remains undiminished.

<center>
<h3>Redistributionism vs. Property Rights</h3>
</center>

The class politics that animates today's welfare state made its subtle 
entry into the political arena through the progressive income tax.  The 
well-known Marxist formula for justice is "from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his need."  The first part of the credo 
("from each according to his ability") is exemplified by the progressive 
income tax, where those who have the greater ability to produce wealth 
have the greater obligation to pay.   The second part of the credo 
awaited only the advent of the welfare state for its implementation.  
The redistribution of wealth through public spending would ensure that 
everyone received, not indeed according to his merit or ability, but 
"according to his need."  What is lost in this attempt to secure the 
welfare of the whole is the rights of individuals.  While the 
Progressives did not identify democracy as "a mere scheme for the 
redistribution of wealth," they never wavered in their belief that redistribution was "a necessary condition or means of progress." 
<P>

Part of today's ethics of redistribution has taken the form of an 
attack on the right to property.  It is said that property rights exist only 
at the expense of human rights; property ownership inspires greed 
whereas social justice requires compassion.  The inescapable 
conclusion is that human rights can be protected only to the extent that 
the right to property is diminished or extinguished.  
<P>

Former Supreme Court Justice William Brennan once remarked that 
<P>

<blockquote>
Government participation in the economic existence of 
individuals is pervasive and deep.  Administrative matters 
and other dealings with government are at the epicenter of 
the exploding law.  We turn to government and to the law 
for controls which would never have been expected or 
tolerated before this century. . . .  Now hundreds of 
thousands of Americans live entire lives without any real 
prospect of the dignity and autonomy that ownership of 
real property would confer.  Protection of the human 
dignity of such citizens requires a much modified view of 
the proper relationship of individual and state.   
</blockquote>

<P>
This modification of the relation of the individual and the state is, 
of course, the highest imperative of the welfare state.  The important 
question that remains is whether the state can assume priority over the 
right to property without at the same time assuming priority over the 
right to life and liberty.
<P>

It almost goes without saying that Justice Brennan's view of the 
right to property (following that of the Progressives) is wholly at odds 
with the view of the Framers of the Constitution.  James Madison, for 
example, saw no inherent tension between the right to property and the 
rights to life and liberty.  In Madison's view-a view that was virtually 
unanimous in 1789-the right to property was the great vehicle for 
securing the rights to life and liberty:  "that is not a just government, 
nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in 
his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated." 
<P>

Madison and the other leading Framers followed John Locke in 
understanding the right to property as the comprehensive right:  "as a 
man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to 
have a property in his rights."   Locke and the American Founders saw 
the connection between property rights and human rights in a clear and 
precise light.  Locke notes that one of the "Bounds" put on the 
legislative power "by the Society, and the Law of God and Nature" is 
that the legislature "must not raise taxes on the Property of the People, 
without the Consent of the People, given by themselves, or their 
Deputies."   This was repeated in unequivocal terms in the Declaration 
of Independence.  
<P>

As many have pointed out, the taxes imposed on the American 
colonies by the British Parliament were not particularly onerous or 
burdensome.  They were nevertheless taken in the Declaration of 
Independence as evidence of a "design to reduce [the Colonies] under 
absolute despotism."  Under these circumstances, "it is [the people's] 
duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their 
future security."  If property can be taken (or taxes imposed) without 
the consent of the people, then the principle of consent itself is in 
jeopardy because the right to property is the most visible means by 
which the right to consent is protected.  This is the indefeasible 
connection-misunderstood or misconstrued by the Progressives and 
their epigones between the right to property, understood as the 
comprehensive political right, and human rights.  

<center>
<h3>Woodrow Wilson and Constitutional Reform</h3>
</center>

Some five years before Beard's famous work appeared, Woodrow 
Wilson had also attacked the idea of the separation of powers and 
limited government.  Wilson, however, did not do so from the point of 
view of class antagonisms, but from its tendency to suppress the 
"organic will" of the nation:
<P>

<blockquote>
Government is not a machine, but a living thing.  It falls, 
not under the theory of the universe, but under the theory 
of organic life.  It is accountable to Darwin, not to 
Newton.  It is modified by its environment, necessitated 
by its tasks, shaped to its functions by the sheer pressure 
of life.  No living thing can have its organs offset against 
each other as checks, and live.  On the contrary, its life is 
dependent upon their quick cooperation, their ready 
response to the commands of instinct or intelligence, the 
amicable community of purpose.  Living political 
constitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in 
practice. 
</blockquote>

<P>
According to Wilson, separation of powers-indeed limited 
government itself-is antithetical to progress.  Government must have 
unified leadership to meet the shifting exigencies of the day.  This 
notion of the Constitution as an organism has come down to us today in 
the rhetoric of the "living Constitution"-a view that is wholeheartedly 
endorsed by both liberal and conservative members of the Supreme 
Court!
<P>

James Madison wrote in Federalist 49: "it is the reason, alone, of 
the public, that ought to control and regulate the government."  The 
reason of the public is expressed in terms of the rule of law.  And the 
most powerful institutional arrangement for regulating the government 
from this point of view    was the separation of powers and checks and 
balances.  This provided a system in which the ambitions of the various 
office-holders would serve as a countervailing force to control the 
unwise exercise of governmental power.  Thus Madison was not 
exaggerating when he said that the separation of powers was an 
"essential precaution in favor of liberty" because the separation of 
powers bears the most intimate relationship to the preservation of "the 
rights and liberties of the people."  But the Framers were clear that the 
rights to be protected by limited government were individual natural 
rights.  The Progressives opposed separation of powers because they 
were concerned not with individual rights, but with the rights of classes 
or the "organic" rights of the community.

<center>
<h3>Financing the Welfare State</h3>
</center>

Once the decision had been made to begin implementing the 
reforms of the Progressives, it was necessary for the government to 
discover new sources of revenue.  In 1894, Congress passed an income 
tax law that placed a two-percent flat tax on all income over $4,000.  It 
was to last for only five years, expiring in 1900.  In 1895, however, the 
Supreme Court declared the act unconstitutional as a violation of the 
Constitution's ban on any "direct tax" not apportioned among the states 
according to population.  A tax on income, the Court concluded, was a 
direct tax on property and thus forbidden by the Constitution in the 
form proposed in the 1894 Income Tax Act.  The Court's decision in 
Pollock v. Farmer's Loan and Trust Company set off a frenzied 
scramble to amend the Constitution.  One clue to the character of the 
ensuing debate was Justice Henry Brown's dissent in Pollock.  "Even 
the spectre of socialism," he lamented, 
<P>

<blockquote>
is conjured up to frighten Congress from laying taxes upon 
the people in proportion to their ability to pay them . . .  
While I have no doubt that Congress will find some means 
of surmounting the present crisis, my fear is that in some 
moment of national peril this decision will rise up to 
frustrate its will and paralyze its arm.  I hope it may not 
prove the first step toward the submergence of the liberties 
of the people in a sordid despotism of wealth. 
</blockquote>

<P>
The eventual result of the protracted income tax debate was the 
Sixteenth Amendment which allowed "taxes on incomes, from 
whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several 
States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."  The 
subsequent tax law passed in 1913 included a provision aimed at 
implementing the emerging welfare state's sense of social justice-the 
progressive income tax.
<P>

The Framers of the Constitution had included a provision restricting 
direct taxes except when apportioned according to population in order 
to insure that the Federal system of government would remain 
decentralized by making the states the primary recipient of taxes.  This 
restriction would also make it difficult to place a direct tax on capital, 
the most destructive tax in terms of economic growth and economic 
initiative.  Until the income tax law of 1913, the vast majority of 
Federal revenues were derived from imposts and consumer taxes.  
<P>

These had the advantage not only of encouraging thrift and industry, 
but also of being self-limiting.  As Alexander Hamilton noted, 
every class of the community bears its share of the duty in 
proportion to its consumption; which last is regulated by 
the comparative wealth of the respective classes, in 
conjunction with their habits of expense or frugality.  The 
rich and luxurious pay in proportion to their riches and 
luxury; the poor and parsimonious, in proportion to their 
poverty and parsimony.  A chief excellence of this mode 
of revenue is that it preserves a just measure to the abilities 
of individuals, promotes frugality, and taxes 
extravagance.   
<P>

Progressives rejected consumption taxes for a variety of reasons.  
Not only were they supposedly "regressive," but they did not produce 
revenues in nearly the amount required of the emerging welfare state.  
In addition, the individual had too much control over how much taxes 
he would pay-parsimony could be rewarded by lower taxes.  Thus 
many of the Progressives began to look upon the progressive income 
tax as a kind of government induced or government sponsored 
philanthropy.  At bottom, however, the idea of "social justice"-massive 
public spending as a tool to redistribute wealth-was the real impetus for 
the progressive income tax.  "From each according to his ability" was 
now shortly to be connected with "to each according to his need."  This 
is the perfect expression of the "organic unity" of the state.

<center>
<h3>The Progressive Income Tax vs. the Family</h3>
</center>

These notions of "organic unity" and "social justice" have wreaked 
havoc on individual rights.  But undoubtedly the largest casualty of the 
welfare state has been the family.  Indeed, the family is the enemy of 
the welfare state no less than it is for communism because it provides a 
source of authority and allegiance independent of the state.  For Marx, 
no less than for the modern day feminists, the patriarchal family is a 
form of slavery.  Who can doubt that welfare policies have been aimed 
at the break up of the traditional family unit?  It is much easier for 
government to create dependent clients in the absence of strong 
families.
<P>

Progressive tax policies clearly demonstrate the welfare state's bias 
against the family.  In its attempt at wealth redistribution, the welfare 
state has created tremendous tax burdens.  Today, forty percent of the 
median family's income goes to federal, state and local taxes.  Thus 
many women have had to become working mothers-with obvious 
consequences for the stability and integrity of family life.  But working 
mothers contribute little real increase in family income: approximately 
two-thirds has gone for the increase in federal and state taxes during 
the post-World War II period.  What is the welfare state's response to 
the crisis of family life?-more government in the form of day care 
programs!
<P>

More revealing, perhaps, is the tax rate differential for families and 
single taxpayers or childless couples.  Since the mid-1950s, the tax rate 
for families has increased nearly 150 percent while remaining almost 
constant for single taxpayers and childless couples.  This differential is 
principally due to the erosion of the personal exemption for children.  
The value of the current exemption is $2,300; if it had kept pace with 
inflation during the period, it would be $8,000.  
<P>

Many tax reformers advocate an increase in the rate of exemptions 
for children to end this discrimination against the family.  This 
solution, however, misses the point.  Rather we must begin to reduce 
the overall tax burden so that families can devote more resources and 
time to their children.  

<center>
<h3>A Just Solution: The Flat Tax</h3>
</center>

At this late date, the question of how to reel in the excesses of the 
redistributive state is an exceedingly difficult one.  The welfare state 
appears more and more to have taken on a hydra-headed life of its own, 
incapable of controlling itself and not amenable to control from 
outside.  The obvious remedy is to limit the revenues-the life blood-of 
the state; or, failing that, at least to make government spending more 
accountable.  One good way to begin would be to adopt a flat tax.  
While not a perfect solution, a flat tax would be a step in the right 
direction.  It would be equitable: rich and poor and middle class would 
pay at the same rate.  It would thus not penalize industry or force a 
potential producer of wealth to calculate the "marginal rate" of his 
earnings.
<P>

In addition, the flat tax would be simple: there would be no 
complicated bureaucratic rules to mask hidden taxes or hidden 
exemptions.  Certainly the exercise of individual liberties would be 
enhanced by the attendant demise of the Internal Revenue Service 
bureaucracy.  
<P>

What is perhaps most important is that under the flat tax, any 
increase in government spending would be immediately obvious to the 
taxpayer because the percentage of the tax would be raised.  Politicians 
would be forced to justify increased taxes in real terms.  The tax rate 
would thus be tied to real policy issues and would demand justification 
in terms of particularized proposals for increased spending.  Budget 
deals and compromises would be open to public inspection.  Tied with 
a balanced budget provision, there could be no "off-budget" spending 
or "continuing resolutions."  Public spending would become more 
accountable.  In this sense it would slow down the growth of the 
welfare state.  
<P>

Until we repudiate the welfare state and the "progressive" ideas at 
its core we will be fighting a rear guard action.  But let no one be 
mistaken-it is a battle worth fighting.

<h1>Poverty and the Welfare State</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<h3>Thomas G. West</h3>

Conservatives often criticize excessive government spending and 
regulation.  But liberals leave conservatives tongue-tied when they 
accuse them of lacking compassion.  No word in our political 
vocabulary-except perhaps racism-can silence critics of the welfare 
state more quickly and effectively.
<P>

Strangely, hardly anyone pauses to consider the easy assumption 
that it is compassionate to spend money on the poor. Yet we have 
known for some time that most poor people today have not been 
helped, but have been positively harmed, by the poverty programs of 
the 1960s and '70s.  Meanwhile, most of these programs are still in 
place.  The numbers of those dependent on them are growing rapidly.
<P>

Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased 
from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per 
year, an increase of 750 percent.    Even during the 1980s, the 
supposed "decade of greed," federal welfare spending rose almost 50 
percent.   In California in 1992, a welfare mother of two with a 
Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 
per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax 
amount she could have earned at a minimum-wage job. 
<P>

Yet in spite of this generosity, the percentage of poor Americans 
has hardly budged since 1965.  In contrast, before the 1960s, the 
poverty level had been declining rapidly.  According to government 
figures, almost 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, 
that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has 
stubbornly remained ever since. 
<P>

Worse, the nature of poverty has changed.  Prior to the 1960s, most 
poor Americans were poor because their work brought in such a paltry 
income.  After about 1965, there was,   in the words of sociologist 
William Julius Wilson, a "sharp increase in social pathologies in ghetto 
communities."  Poverty became increasingly a problem of a new 
underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  This 
underclass, unlike the poor of an earlier era, has, says social critic 
Myron Magnet, "an impoverished intellectual and emotional development that generally imprisons them in failure."  Many of them frankly 
reject the qualities that most Americans admire: self-control, sobriety, 
hard work, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.  The adult men 
of the underclass rarely marry.  Children are brought up by single 
women or their female relatives.  These mothers are often very young, 
ignorant, and irresponsible.  The men in their lives are temporary 
sexual partners or frightening predators-often both. 
<P>

Among the black underclass in particular, those who cultivate 
decent qualities in themselves or their children are sneered at and said 
to be "acting white."  One high school in a poor neighborhood holds its 
academic awards ceremony at night, without publicity, because when 
the rest of the students attend, the winners are mocked with jeers and 
hoots.  In the world of the underclass, writes social scientist Charles 
Murray, "the drug dealer is lionized, the man who mops floors is 
scorned.  The school girl who gets pregnant is envied, the school girl 
who studies is taunted." 
<P>

These rejected virtues enabled earlier generations of Americans to 
rise out of the poverty into which they were born or (if they were 
immigrants) from which they started out in America.  Even today, 
hard-working and self-disciplined Koreans and others succeed in 
establishing thriving businesses in the poorest neighborhoods in 
America, following the path of earlier generations from poverty to 
modest comfort to the middle class.
<P>

Work in low-paying jobs is where many Americans have 
traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time, being 
pleasant to customers and the boss, and persevering in getting the job 
done.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as 
"chump change."  Ken Auletta quotes a typical underclass male saying, 
"Man, you go two, three years not working, and hanging around and 
smoking reefer or drinking, and then you get a job-you can't handle it.  
You do two, three years of idleness and after the first two, three years 
of working, you feel people are pushing you.  You say, 'I don't want to 
get up in the morning, get pushed and shoved.  I'm gonna get on 
welfare.'" 

<center>
<h3>Poverty and Welfare, 1776 to 1965</h3>
</center>

Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most 
successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago most 
Americans-at least 90 percent-were desperately poor by today's 
standards.  By the 1960s most were middle class.  Meanwhile, most of 
the rest of the world remained as poor in 1965 as they were in 1776.
The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program 
was simple:
<P>

<UL>
<li>(1)  Establish free markets and opportunity for all who 
can work.
<li>(2)  Provide strong governmental support for the family 
and for a morality of self-controlled self-assertion (combining industriousness, self-restraint, and basic decency with 
the vigilant spirit that says "Don't tread on me").
<li>(3)  Provide support in local communities for the 
deserving poor:  widows, orphans, and the disabled who are 
unable to work.
</ul>

<P>
Poor people become unpoor when their work is rewarded by 
income, when they marry and support a family, and when their leaders 
publicly affirm the dignity of self-support, sacrifice, and responsibility.  
In the middle ages a serf might have worked hard all his life, but the 
wealth he produced often went into the hands of a wealthy landowner.  
In America a man had the right to keep what he earned, and the 
authorities praised him for doing so.
<P>

In the view of America's Founders, poverty programs that helped 
people whether or not they could work were not only ineffective but 
unjust.  Compelling workers to support those who refuse to work 
would be to make some men masters and other men slaves: the haves 
would be enslaved to the have-nots.  Thomas Jefferson said,
<P>

<blockquote>
If we are made in some degree for others, yet in a greater 
are we made for ourselves.  It were contrary to feeling, 
and indeed ridiculous, to suppose that a man had less right 
in himself than one of his neighbors, or indeed all of them 
put together.  This would be slavery, and not that liberty 
which the bill of rights has made inviolable, and for the 
preservation of which our government has been charged. 
</blockquote>

<P>
For Jefferson, a welfare state that supported shirkers, far from being 
compassionate, would have violated the rights of the working poor.
Although the Declaration of Independence says we have a right to 
life and liberty, it does not say we have a right to happiness.  Unlike 
life and liberty, happiness is not something we possess by nature.  
Likewise, there is a right to acquire and possess property, but no right 
to be wealthy.  Everyone has the natural capacity to acquire wealth and 
pursue happiness, just as everyone has the capacity to live, be free, and 
worship God.  To possess a right, even to exercise it, does not 
guarantee that it will lead to the end desired.  Happiness is earned by 
talent and effort, or enjoyed unbought through grace or good fortune.  
It is not a right.
<P>

Abraham Lincoln once responded to Southern critics of capitalism 
in this way:  "The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for 
wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for 
himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length 
hires another new beginner to help him."  This system "gives hope to 
all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all."    
When Lincoln led the nation into Civil War, it was not for the principle 
that the masters owed their former slaves a living.  That would have 
been to turn the former masters into slaves, and the former slaves into 
masters.
<P>

For earlier Americans, it is always wrong for one group in society 
to live off the labor of another group-whether it be white slaveholders 
or the underclass that despises "dead-end jobs" and "chump change."  
"It is the same tyrannical principle," said Lincoln.  "It is the same 
principle in whatever shape it develops itself.  It is the same spirit that 
says, 'You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' " 
<P>

This did not mean that Americans like Lincoln and Jefferson were 
"social Darwinists," indifferent to the plight of the few who, through no 
fault of their own, could not work or had no family to care for them.  
From the earliest colonial days, local governments took full 
responsibility for their poor.  But one thing was always clear:  able-
bodied men and women were not supported by the taxpayers unless 
they worked, if necessary in establishments that provided them food 
and shelter in exchange for labor.  Only those too old or weak or sick 
to work were taken care of in idleness.
<P>

Jefferson gives us a vivid picture of welfare in early America in his 
Notes on the State of Virginia.
<P>

<blockquote>
The poor who have neither property, friends, nor strength 
to labor, are boarded in the houses of good farmers, to 
whom a stipulated sum is annually paid. . . . Vagabonds 
without visible property or vocation, are placed in 
workhouses, where they are well clothed, fed, lodged, and 
made to labor.  Nearly the same method of providing for 
the poor prevails through all our states; and from 
Savannah to Portsmouth you will seldom meet a beggar.
</blockquote>

<P>
In addition to this minimal "safety-net" support from government, 
voluntary charities, often church-based, provided further benefits.  
Hospitals for the poor, educational institutions, YMCAs, and more 
were established all over America by public-spirited citizens.  When 
Tocqueville visited America in the early 1800s, he was astounded at 
the number and variety of such associations, all promoted by 
volunteers in local communities.
<P>

The Founders' main objection to welfare for those who refuse to 
work was to its injustice.  But they were also aware of the problem of 
welfare creating poverty, which we see so massively today.  Benjamin 
Franklin once said,
<P>

<blockquote>
I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of 
the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, 
is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving 
them out of it. . . .  There is no country in the world where 
so many provisions are established for them [as in 
England] . . . , with a solemn general law made by the rich 
to subject their estates to a heavy tax for the support of the 
poor.  [Yet] there is no country in the world in which the 
poor are more idle, dissolute, drunken, and insolent.  The 
day you [Englishmen] passed that act, you took away from 
before their eyes the greatest of all inducements to 
industry, frugality, and sobriety, by giving them a 
dependence on something else than a careful accumulation 
during youth and health, for support in old age and 
sickness.  In short, you offered a premium for the 
encouragement of idleness, and you should not now 
wonder that it has had the effect in the increase of 
poverty. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Marvin Olasky has shown in detail in The Tragedy of American 
Compassion how earlier Americans combined Franklin's hard-headed 
realism about the ill effects of indiscriminate generosity with a warm-
hearted sympathy for those who fell into need through no fault of their 
own.  Especially encouraged were those who were willing to give up 
their idleness to follow the path of responsibility and self-reliance.  
Americans of that day always kept in mind the example of God 
himself, who is infinitely merciful-but only to the repentant who strive 
to do better.

<h3>Poverty and Welfare After 1965</h3>
</center

A few American intellectuals, influenced by European socialist 
thinkers, began to question the Founders' conception of individual 
responsibility as early as the 1830s.  By 1900 many intellectuals were 
beginning to turn away from the traditional American view that in a 
free country destitution usually comes from a defect in character, while 
frugal and industrious conduct usually lead to a comfortable living.  
This began to influence actual policy debates. 
<P>

But it was not until the mid-1960s that welfare was conceived as a 
right to be demanded of society by anyone in need, regardless of 
conduct or circumstances.  Gone was the earlier worry about welfare 
creating dependency and therefore subsidizing poverty.  Gone was the 
demand that individuals seeking government support should act in 
accord with minimal moral standards.  Compassion was the 
watchword.  Federal funding provided the cash.
<P>

The old system had tried to focus its help on the deserving poor 
while keeping benefit levels low enough to prevent poverty from being 
an economically attractive alternative to work.  The new system 
abandoned the distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor, 
and it raised typical benefit levels above the equivalent of a minimum 
wage job.
<P>

Charles Murray has persuasively explained the perverse incentive 
structure of the modern welfare state.  Generous payments to women 
with children expand poverty by funding it.  "There is no need to 
invoke the specters of cultural pathologies or inferior upbringing.  The 
choices [of the poor to forego work for welfare] may be seen much 
more simply, much more naturally, as the behavior of people 
responding to the reality of the world around them and making the 
decisions-the legal, approved, and even encouraged decisions-that 
maximize their quality of life."    Robert Rector summarizes the point 
in this way:
<P>

<blockquote>
Current welfare may best be conceptualized as a system 
which offers each single mother a "paycheck". . . . She 
will continue to receive her "paycheck" as long as she 
fulfills two conditions:  1) she must not work; and 2) she 
must not marry an employed male. . . .
<P>


Welfare has converted the low-income working husband 
from a necessary breadwinner into a net financial 
handicap.  It has transformed marriage from an institution 
designed to protect and nurture children into an institution 
which financially penalizes nearly all low-income parents 
who practice it. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Social science research has established with precision that benefit 
levels are closely correlated with single motherhood.  Rector reports:
<P>

<blockquote>
In 1979, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
established a large sample of young women (aged 14 to 
19) and then tracked the behavior of these women over the 
next decade.  [NLSY data shows] that a 50 percent 
increase in the monthly value of AFDC and Food Stamp 
benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-
of-wedlock births over the study period.  [Another study 
shows that] a 10 percent increase in AFDC benefits in a 
state will cause a decrease in the marriage rate of all single 
mothers in the state by 8 percent.
</blockquote>

<P>
The data also confirm the common-sense view that children raised 
without fathers are more likely to be spoiled and undisciplined.  
"[H]olding family income, neighborhood, parental education, and other 
variables constant, young black men from single-parent homes are 
twice as likely to commit crimes and end up in jail when compared to 
young black men raised in low-income families where the father is 
present." 
<P>

George Gilder adds an important dimension to this economic 
analysis.  He shows that when government gives women large sums of 
money, it has the unintended effect of making men feel inferior to their 
women.  Women have a natural superiority to men when it comes to 
bearing children.  To measure up to women as equals, men have always 
felt the need to be the principal providers in the family.  When 
government support became widely available to unmarried women in 
the 1960s, "welfare payments usurped the man's role as provider, 
leaving fatherless families." Welfare destroys the incipient families of 
the poor by making the struggling male breadwinner 
superfluous and thereby emasculating him emotionally.  His response 
is predictable.  He turns to the super-masculine world of the street: 
drinking, drugs, male camaraderie, and crime. 
<P>

The analyses of Murray and Gilder need to be supplemented in one 
respect.  Myron Magnet and others have shown that the ideas of 
America's academic and media elites played as big a role in the 
massive changes of the 1960s, as the changes in benefit levels.  They 
decisively changed the attitude of the poor toward their own poverty. 
Since the '60s, poor Americans have all faced the same economic 
and psychological incentives not to work.  Yet different groups respond 
to these identical incentives in very different ways.  Poor Asian 
immigrants, for example, most often decline the generous offers of 
government help.  Instead, they become self-reliant entrepreneurs.  
Other Americans, especially poor blacks, more often accept 
government's tempting handouts.  However, blacks who have 
immigrated to the United States from the West Indies live more like 
whites than like other blacks.  Their average income is about the same 
as that of whites, and their crime rates are actually lower than whites'.   
Analysts sometimes call the source of these differences cultural.  It is 
more accurate to say that the source is people's differing opinions of 
right and wrong, and the conduct that follows from those opinions.
Prior to the '60s, it was considered shameful to be on the dole and to 
bear a child without being married.  One telling example: the director 
of a large maternity home in the 1950s said, "Society regards 
illegitimacy as an inroad on the family's stability and permanency, and 
repels it by ostracizing the unwed mother."    The desired situation, 
everyone thought, was to get married, have children, and support the 
family with a job.
<P>

Beginning in the '60s, the poor were taught by welfare organizers 
that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Welfare mothers came to 
meetings of the National Welfare Rights Organization "with a sense 
that welfare should be avoided."  But "constant repetition of the word 
rights got through to the women."  The result, as one welfare official 
commented at the time, was "a changing outlook among many poor 
and the near poor." Within a few years, a much larger proportion of 
those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.    In a similar 
way, America's elites, who were enthusiastically celebrating the sexual 
revolution, taught the poor that bearing children outside of marriage 
was a perfectly acceptable way to live.  Those who said otherwise were 
denounced as puritanical or even racist.
<P>

Instead of teaching the virtues of sobriety, self-reliance, and 
responsible parenthood, America's most influential voices now scoffed 
at "bourgeois values."  "Blaming the victim" and "racism" were the 
shrill charges leveled against anyone who dared to criticize the 
teenagers who lightly bore children and then raised them badly without 
bothering to get married.  Far from condemning the able-bodied poor 
who refused to work or marry, liberals taught the poor to blame "the 
system."  Because of capitalism and racism, the poor were told, they 
had no control over their fate.  They were passive victims, and there 
was nothing they could do about it.  As victims, they had endless rights 
but no responsibilities. 
<P>

Plato suggested in book 8 of his Republic that the fundamental 
cause of public policy under any form of government is the character 
and beliefs of the ruling class.  If Plato was right, as I think he was, this 
change in our leaders' conception of justice was the decisive event of 
the 1960s.  Their grandparents had faith in God, believed that sex was 
best reserved for marriage, and controlled their impulses toward instant 
gratification.  They believed in the principles of the Declaration, 
supporting equal rights for all individuals.  The grandchildren who 
became the leaders of the '60s rejected all that as hopelessly naive-and 
unjust.
<P>

The poor quickly learned the lesson taught by their patrons.  Its 
impact on their lives, however, was more devastating.  All the common 
character flaws of lower-class life were exalted into symptoms of 
society's corruption.  Laziness, irresponsible sex, abandonment of 
children, drugs, drinking, crime:  these were no longer vices but 
understandable signs of rebellion against a rotten, even criminal, 
bourgeois system.  Ramsey Clark, Lyndon Johnson's Attorney General, 
wrote that "[C]rime among poor blacks . . . flows clearly and directly 
from the brutalization and dehumanization of racism, poverty, and 
injustice. . . . To permit conditions that breed antisocial conduct is our 
greatest crime."  Trained by such sentiments to believe that "the system 
is to blame," blacks in more than thirty cities rioted between 1964 and 
1967, destroying one black neighborhood after another across 
America. 
<P>

During the 1960s, "poor" practically became a synonym for 
"black," as government directed its anti-poverty energies to black 
neighborhoods in the North and black rural areas in the South.  Long-
established black patterns of life had centered, as historian Herbert 
Gutman has shown, on the stable nuclear family.    Yet their family 
life collapsed under the weight of the attention lavished on blacks by 
this uplifting crusade.  The destruction of the way of life of decent 
blacks should-but does not-haunt the consciences of liberals.  One law-
abiding black commented bitterly, on the occasion of the accidental 
shooting of a nine-year-old girl by a thug's casual bullet, "Our lives 
have been reduced to the lowest levels of human existence." 
<P>

The destruction of the black communities of America was the 
legacy of the anti-poverty crusade of the 1960s.  Blacks who are old 
enough to remember earlier times sometimes recall the days of official 
discrimination with fondness-not because they favor segregation, of 
course, but because in those days there were communities of families, 
schools, shared responsibility, and basic decency.
<P>

Ralph Abernathy was Martin Luther King's successor as head of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a longtime civil rights 
leader.  In his autobiography he described the life of his childhood in 
almost nostalgic terms.  His father, he said, 
<P>

<blockquote>
was a farmer, as were most people who lived in the South 
at that time [the 1930s]; but unlike some of our neighbors, 
black and white, we were not struggling to survive on a 
patch of hard-scrabble land.  My father owned 
approximately five hundred acres of good, black soil that 
he had bought a few acres at a time, having begun with a 
wedding gift of a milk cow and a calf.
To get ahead, he did three things:  worked as hard as he 
possibly could; led a severely disciplined and sober life; 
and married well. . . .
<P>

[He believed] in righteousness and self-reliance. . . .
<P>

In a rural area where land was available to people who 
were willing to work for it, it was possible for a few blacks 
to enjoy both freedom and a kind of equality-one based on 
mutual respect and a certain standoffishness.  It was not an 
ideal community by any means. . . .  Indeed, that world 
was a fragile one; and its survival depended on staying in 
the country and living among people you had known all 
your life and who had known you. . . .
<P>

[In the 1980s,] as I encounter these tragic young faces [of 
poor blacks] all over the country, I remember the faces of 
my brothers and sisters and cousins a half century ago, 
working in the fields of rural Alabama, glistening in the 
hot summer sun.  The faces I recall are not as bitter and 
hopeless as the ones I see today, if only because my father 
and the other adults in my family understood that 
economic independence, our ultimate freedom and 
salvation, was achievable. 
</blockquote>

<P>
In spite of segregation, Abernathy was saying, it was possible for 
blacks to live decently in a country that provided the basic civil 
right-the right denied to the slaves-to keep the wealth they earned with 
their own hands.
<P>

Life was better for many blacks in the North as well.  In 1947, 
third-grade students at black economist Thomas Sowell's Harlem 
elementary school "matched the citywide average in understanding 
both paragraph meaning and word meaning,    and they exceeded the 
citywide average in arithmetic. . . . Compare that with today, when 
everyone takes it for granted that ghetto schools will perform miles 
behind everyone else." 
<P>

Black columnist William Raspberry recalls that a young man killed 
in a motorcycle accident was "the only con-temporary of ours to die of 
any cause" during his late teens and early twenties (in the 1950s and 
'60s).  Raspberry's own middle-class children, in contrast, can name 
half a dozen deaths among their acquaintances, including several 
murders.  Conditions in poor black neighborhoods, of course, are far 
worse. 
<P>

The dimension of the change appears most obviously in a single 
disheartening statistic:  in 1950, only one-sixth of blacks were born to 
an unmarried mother; by 1993, over two-thirds of blacks were born 
illegitimate.   In other words, the vast majority of blacks today grow 
up without fathers, without models of male decency, without the 
toughness of male discipline, and without the experience and the 
example of a father's love for a child and for a wife and mother.  Out of 
the nightmare world of impoverished single mothers, undisciplined 
teenagers, and adult male lawlessness comes the bulk of today's cases 
of child abuse, drug abuse, and crime.

<center>
<h3>What Is To Be Done?</h3>
</center>

In the long run we should aim to restore the welfare policies that 
prevailed in America prior to the 1960s.  The principle of those policies 
is simple:  equal opportunity for all, with government support only for 
those who are truly unable to provide for themselves.
<P>

As a practical matter, in the short run, we should take steps to 
approximate the older way to the extent politically feasible.
First and most important, political and community leaders should 
again speak candidly about virtue and vice.  We know destructive and 
immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us.  There is 
no good reason to refrain politely from pointing out the truth when the 
lives and souls of the next generation are being trashed so casually 
every day.  America waged its only successful War on Poverty before 
1965, when its leaders affirmed the dignity of marriage, work, honesty, 
self-sufficiency, and individual responsibility.  And if a responsible life 
is a life of dignity, then we must overcome our squeamishness and 
affirm publicly that an irresponsible life is a life of indignity, of 
degradation.  In Charles Murray's words,
<P>

<blockquote>
Let government policy start from the premise that to bring 
a baby into the world when one is not emotionally or 
financially equipped to be a parent is not just ill-advised, 
not just inimical to the long-term interests of the mother; it 
is profoundly irresponsible.  It is wrong. 
</blockquote>

<P>
Second, government must undo the perverse economic incentives 
that it has created through its misguided, community-destroying 
generosity.  Welfare laws, like all laws, should encourage, and in no 
way discourage, marriage and work.

<P> 
Most urgently, we should return to the older and common-sense 
policy of refusing government support to unmarried women bearing 
children.  This policy led to what Murray calls "a stern self-selection 
process . . . in which the prospects [were] so grim" that single mothers 
rarely chose "to keep their babies instead of giving them up" for 
adoption.  To keep a fatherless child almost guaranteed a life of 
physical hardship and social ostracism.  Today, true compassion for the 
well-being of the children as well as the mother demands that 
government refuse to be a party to single motherhood.  Murray rightly 
remarks that government "cannot and must not intervene in the 
decision to have a baby."  It would be wrong to "give people licenses to 
have babies" or "take babies away" from unmarried women.  But it is 
also wrong for government to give such women special benefits.  They 
should be eligible only for the same programs, such as unemployment 
benefits, as everyone else. 
<P>

For widows and women abandoned by their husbands, some 
temporary aid is appropriate.  However, the aid should be given in such 
a way as to compel the women to support themselves, or to find men to 
support them, as quickly as possible.  Cash or cash-equivalent 
benefits-AFDC, food stamps, medical care, housing allowances-should 
be converted to in-kind provision of basic material needs in 
institutional settings.  Strict rules of civilized conduct should be 
enforced.  Food should be nourishing but plain.  In general, wherever 
welfare is appropriate, it should be made less pleasant, less convenient, 
and less subject to abuse.  There must be a time limit-perhaps as short 
as three months-for eligibility.  Tax credits for babysitting expenses 
would make it possible for them to work when or before benefits run 
out.
<P>

For those truly unable to provide for themselves due to chronic 
disease or old age, long-term welfare should be made available only in 
institutional settings.  Small homes or apartment buildings, privately 
owned and reimbursed by taxpayers, or at least locally administered, 
would best protect everyone concerned.
<P>

Other policy changes not directly related to single motherhood 
would improve the lives and opportunities of the poor.
<P>

For example, a third reform would be a serious response to the 
crime that poisons poor neighborhoods.  The poor deserve, and justice 
demands, an efficient system of arrest, fair trial (not plea bargains), at 
least some punishment for every offense, imprisonment for the first 
serious offense, and escalating punishments for repeat offenders.  The 
juvenile justice system, laughed at by underclass children who breezily 
commit cold-blooded murders, should be toughened up.  The most 
urgent purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  
That purpose is pervasively subverted in every major city in America, 
where flagrant piracy is a way of life for a substantial minority of the 
underclass.  The law-abiding poor need such protection more than the 
middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer 
neighborhood.
<P>

State governments handle most of our criminal justice system. 
State-level politicians must therefore put these reforms into effect. 
Simply to enforce existing criminal law would be a radical change 
from present practice, as Joseph M. and Anne Nutter Bessette point 
out:  "Nearly one-third of those convicted of a felony in state courts in 
1988 served no time in prison or jail. . . . half of convicted murderers 
released from prison each year serve less than six years for their crime; 
half of released rapists serve three years or less."  The majority of 
crimes are committed by these same convicted criminals who serve 
minimal or no sentences. 
<P>

Even increased police protection can make a difference, as Los 
Angeles learned during the second Rodney King trial.  When a repeat 
of the 1992 riots was feared, police were posted on the streets of South 
L. A. in large numbers.  In a television interview, a black man 
commented, "It's safe, but I don't see why we can't have this kind of 
presence all the time."  A black woman said, "It was wonderful.  For 
the first time I was able to just go out for a walk . . . without always 
looking over my shoulder for someone." 
<P>

Less obvious than crime, but important for opportunity, are the 
legal obstacles faced by the ambitious poor.  A fourth reform would 
reduce these obstacles.  Since the '60s, regulation and high taxation 
have made it hard for the poor to enter the market and produce goods 
and services, and even to find affordable housing.   Big companies 
with well-paid lawyers can cope with the endless red tape of regulation.  
Businessmen who are just getting started cannot.  A federal law 
exempting all businesses with fewer than 50 employees from most 
federal and state regulation would be a simple way to start this process.  
State governments should act in parallel fashion, for instance by setting 
limits on local zoning laws that prevent the poor from working in their 
homes and neighborhoods.  Housing regulations that require expensive 
construction methods are known to create homelessness.    These 
should be modified or eliminated wherever possible.  Economist 
Walter Williams has written of other areas for potential reform, for 
example in arbitrary licensing requirements that exclude blacks and 
others from driving taxis and practicing other trades. 
<P>

Fifth, laws strengthening the family are long overdue.  The latest 
social-science research confirms what common sense has always 
known:  broken and single-mother families produce a high proportion 
of unhappy children, who often grow up to become self-indulgent, 
abusive, sometimes criminal adults.  There should be firm public 
endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and 
mother raising their own offspring.  So-called alternative family life-
styles should be treated with the contempt, or silence, they deserve.
<P>

The law can do much to support the family.  Parents of children 
ought to be given tax relief.  Because of the dependent exemption, the 
median family of four in 1948 paid almost no income tax.  Today, that 
family pays almost 24 percent of its income in payroll and income 
taxes.    No-fault divorce ought to be eliminated, and divorce generally 
ought to be made more difficult.  Most controversially, we ought to 
consider restoring the pre-1900 custom of awarding child custody in 
divorces to the parent who is in the best position to provide for the 
children's material needs-usually the father.  The full weight of the law 
could then be lowered on him if he failed to fulfill his legal duty to his 
children.  This last reform would make many a woman and man 
hesitate before breaking up a family on the basis of a passing fancy or 
vague feelings of unfulfillment.  If women were threatened with losing 
the children they love, and if men could not look forward to the 
footloose freedom they might crave, mothers and fathers would be 
likely to try harder to keep their marriages intact by mutual concessions 
and affection. 
<P>

Sixth and last, the scandal of the non-education of the poor in public 
schools must be repaired.  In the immediate term, tax credits for school 
expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to 
private schools.  In the longer term, public schools need radical 
overhaul, with much higher educational and disciplinary standards.  
This will only follow from a policy of returning control over schools to 
local communities.  Funding will become available by canceling 
about three-quarters of administrative positions in public education.
This essay has said nothing about government waste, high taxes on 
the middle class, loose eligibility requirements, welfare cheats, and 
similar issues.  That is because these are not the main problems.  
Americans are a generous people.  They are willing to impose 
burdensome taxes on themselves if they are convinced that it is for the 
public good.  There is therefore only one way to return to the wisdom, 
and the effective anti-poverty program, of pre-1965 America.  
America's leaders must explain clearly that giving things 
indiscriminately to poor people harms rather than helps them.  We need 
to discover once again-as our Founders knew well-that compassion 
calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than 
as mindless children who will never grow up.

<h1>Educating Citizens</h1>
</center>
<hr size=4 align=center>

<h3>Christopher Flannery</h3>

Democracy requires more of its citizens than any other form of 
government.  It depends on the capacity of the citizens to govern 
themselves.  But the habits and dispositions of self government are 
difficult to acquire and to sustain.  They are rooted in moral and 
political principles in which each new generation must be educated.  It 
is no accident that history provides so few examples of successful and 
enduring democracies.  In the American democracy today, we have 
largely lost sight of those principles which provide the common ground 
of American political community and inform the civic character 
required of American citizens.  There is widespread recognition of the 
necessity to restore private morality and to strengthen the common 
bonds of civility among the diverse citizens of America.  Educating 
citizens in the principles, rights, duties, and capacities of citizenship is 
the primary purpose of American public education.  That our schools 
are failing miserably in accomplishing this purpose is apparent to all 
who have eyes to see and ears to hear.  
<P>

There are, of course, other and more publicized failings in 
American education such as the decline in SAT scores and in the basic 
skills needed for a competitive workforce.  These are connected with 
the failure to educate good citizens.  Their causes are many and 
various.  Even when we can agree on the causes, it is not always 
possible to agree upon or even to envision a solution.  To the extent 
that a single cause may be identified as the primary source of our 
failure at the task of educating citizens, it can be summed up simply:  
bad ideas.  
<P>

American education today, from the earliest elementary levels to 
the graduate schools, is dominated by doctrines that openly repudiate 
the principles on which America is founded;  indeed, they deny the 
very capacity of men to distinguish freedom from tyranny, justice from 
injustice, right from wrong.  These doctrines have wholly discredited 
the perspective of the democratic citizen: they have made self 
government itself unintelligible as a political phenomenon.  The 
consequence has been a corruption of the political language through 
which the nation conducts its public deliberations, a citizenry 
increasingly confused or uncertain about the ground and substance of 
its rights and duties, and political and educational leaders capable for 
the most part only of deepening the crisis.  These bad ideas are rooted 
in a profound assault upon human reason and human nature as grounds 
of human morality, an assault waged over the past two centuries 
culminating in explicit and assertive nihilism.  The popular expressions 
of these ideas in our time take a wide variety of forms.  But in the 
world of American education today, they converge most faddishly 
under the banners of "Multiculturalism" and "Diversity."
<P>

The multicultural movement and the diversity movement are 
distinct political and intellectual movements which frequently overlap 
and reinforce one another.  Their stronghold is in the academies of 
higher learning, whence they have sallied forth into practically every 
nook and cranny of American life.  Anyone who reads a daily paper or 
a national news magazine has read about them over the past several 
years.  They are "multi"-dimensional or "diverse" as one might expect, 
but it is possible to identify their most common ideas and predilections.  
For convenience sake, I will refer to the diverse phenomena as 
multiculturalism.

<center> 
<h3>Multiculturalism</h3>
</center>

The foremost idea of multiculturalism is the equal value of all 
cultures, or cultural relativism.  This is an idea that has made it 
impossible for a generation of American students to make the perfectly 
rational moral distinction between a "culture" that puts Jews in ovens 
and one that grants them freedom of worship and all rights of 
citizenship.  (Under the heading of "diversity," this is also why public 
schools must not teach that monogamous heterosexual marriage is 
morally preferable to homosexual promiscuity.  All "lifestyles," like all 
cultures, are created equal.)  
<P>

This is not just the view of zealots or extremists but of the 
mainstream, supposedly responsible public officials making policy at 
the highest levels.  To offer just one small example among countless 
thousands:  At a conference sponsored by the National Governors 
Association, a distinguished historian who was a co-author of the 
California Framework for History and the Social Sciences announced 
that "California would be teaching democratic values as a standard of 
judgment" for its students.  In response, "half a dozen speakers jumped 
to the microphone to argue that it was ethnocentric and chauvinistic to 
expect other people to care about or practice democracy."  Again:  this 
was not a rally for the resurrection of the Grateful Dead, but a 
conference sponsored by the National Governors Association.  It took 
place, as it happens, just prior to the spectacle of Chinese youths in 
Tiananmen Square erecting their Goddess of Democracy on the model 
of the Statue of Liberty and shouting "Give me liberty or give me 
death!"   (Many got the latter; none got the former, but it would be 
"ethnocentric" to suggest who got the worst of it.)  
<P>

This reigning dogma among professional educators who shape the 
curriculum of American public schools requires a non-chauvinistic, 
non-ethnocentric, balanced treatment of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, 
and Jefferson or Lincoln.  Moral relativism prohibits preferring 
freedom to despotism or believing that there can be a rational ground 
for preferring one over the other.  With Lincolnian firmness, our civics 
instruction is dedicated to the proposition that "the concept of freedom 
can mean different things to different people in different 
circumstances."  While true, this is hardly conclusive, and offers small 
consolation to the one being enslaved by another's concept of 
freedom.  
<P>

Inherent in the idea of cultural relativism is the idea that culture, 
race, or ancestry (feminist multiculturalists throw in gender) determines 
our ideas.  Our minds, that is, are locked inside our skins, and the gulf 
between races or cultures is unbridgeable.  There is no such thing as 
human reason capable of grasping any part of objective moral truth 
(also non-existent) which is worthy of imparting to a student.  No truth, 
that is, except the asserted truth that certain preferred cultures must be 
"affirmed."  We must, therefore, have black teachers to teach the black 
point of view to black students; "hispanic" teachers to teach the 
"hispanic" point of view to "hispanic" students, etc.  Education itself 
becomes merely the imposition of one's own ethnically or culturally 
determined prejudices on others.  The relation between teacher and 
student can be understood only in terms of power.  
<P>

Multiculturalists loudly denounce the emphasis in American 
schools on American history and culture and western civilization.  
Everyone has read about this.  Perpetuating the American heritage in 
American public schools falls under the heading of "Eurocentrism," 
one of the worst forms of cultural or ethnic chauvinism.  It 
discriminates against other cultures by denying them an equal "voice" 
in the classroom or the textbooks.  One might think that it would be a 
rational and non-controversial approach to teach American students 
about the American Declaration of Independence and the American 
Constitution.  This is naive.  And, again, it is not just the "fringe 
elements" who protest.  At a meeting of the California School Boards 
Association, a school board member objected to such an approach:  
"We have children from all over the world.  They want to learn about 
their own cultural heritage, not about the Bill of Rights."   American 
taxpayers are thus required to support the inculcation among American 
citizens of non-American cultural heritages however antipathetic these 
cultures may be to democracy or to American institutions.  The 
preferred cultural categories, "black" or "African," "hispanic," "Asian," 
"Pacific Islander," and so on, are egregiously arbitrary.  How many 
hundreds of "cultures" are there in Africa?  Should Puerto Ricans be 
compelled to immerse themselves in Mexican culture?  But the 
categories are more or less convenient for the bureaucracies.  
<P>

Bilingualism springs from this fount of multiculturalism.  The 
common understanding of bilingualism is that it is a program 
facilitating the transition to English literacy for American students 
whose first or native tongue is something other than English.  In fact, 
the animating idea of the bilingual movement today is to preserve the 
sanctity of the students' "native" language and culture against the 
imperialistic efforts to force the "foreign" tongue of English upon 
them.  According to a study by one of the country's leading experts on 
bilingualism, "71% of the studies show transitional bilingual education 
to be no different from or actually worse than doing nothing" to 
achieve English literacy.   Bilingualism has even worse effects in 
math.  Federal statistics, moreover, show that "as many as 60% of the 
children to whom ["transitional" bilingual education] is offered are not 
in need of a "transition" to English since English is already their best 
language." 
<P>

The more tepid multiculturalists say that teaching "American 
culture" is fine and proper, adding merely that American culture is 
defined by unqualified openness to all cultures.  These are the ones 
who chant that it is "Diversity" that unifies us; and in a meeting of 
professional "educators" no one laughs or raises a puzzled eyebrow.  
<P>

The more ardent multiculturalists not only denounce the emphasis on 
western civilization as bad but denounce western civilization and its 
American variety as uniquely evil in themselves.  The very ideas of 
"humanity" and "reason" are seen in this view as eurocentric (and for 
the feminists, patriarchal) prejudices contrived to exploit "oppressed" 
cultures.  This is the real driving force of the multicultural movement.  
Multiculturalism has no patience for objective academic standards 
of excellence.  These are merely other means by which the "dominant 
culture" oppresses "minority cultures."  Therefore objective tests are 
denounced as racist, and multiculturalists insist that students be graded 
only within their racial or cultural group or that tests be redesigned so 
that preferred "minorities" perform as well as the "dominant" racial 
group.  This is called "Race-norming," and it has been practiced in the 
hiring policies of the federal government for years.  Private employers 
are now reluctant to take high school diplomas or grades into account 
in hiring for fear of being punished under the law for racial 
discrimination. 
<P>

The multiculturalist replaces education with therapy, insisting that 
supporting the students' "self-esteem" is the governing object of 
education.  Self esteem is achieved by teaching the students of 
"oppressed cultures" to be proud of their particular race or ancestry.  
Some argue that this should be done by revealing the true greatness of 
these cultures.  The more candid or incautious multiculturalists admit 
or even insist that the self worth of the oppressed must be cultivated by 
myths where facts will not do the trick.  
<P>

A relatively harmless example of the "truth-road-to-self esteem" is 
UC Irvine's Native American Intertribal University Preparatory 
Summer Program, a $700,000 a year program serving a few hundred 
youths from a few dozen different tribes each year.  As one of the 
participants described the purposes of the program, "Every person here 
needs to make these kids understand how worthy they are as Native 
Americans."  To help accomplish this students study canoe 
construction and build shelters with bark to demonstrate how inventive 
and environmentally sound Native Americans are, and especially "to 
disprove this notion that Native Americans didn't work very hard."  
Some teachers apparently considered whether it might be more 
beneficial "to concentrate class time on what the children have to do to 
succeed in school and in mainstream society."  But parents seemed 
pleased.  One marvelled at how his daughter had "matured and 
developed a confidence in her own worth and an identity as a native 
woman" in only three weeks.   
<P>

Oppressed students can travel the multicultural road to self-esteem 
beyond the walls of their schoolyards.  It branches off into every corner 
of popular culture.  "Indians are about the environment, sensitivity, and 
culture," as Bonnie Paradise, Director of the American Indian Registry, 
said while denouncing the insensitive treatment of Native Americans in 
the movie "Black Robe."   Speaking for the organized handicapped or 
"differently abled" as they are sometimes called, Ira Zimmerman, 
advocacy chairman of the National Stuttering Project, complains about 
the unflattering depictions of stutterers in such movies as "A Fish 
Called Wanda" and "Oscar."  Expanding his clientele he complains that 
the movie "Hook" was not introduced by "a public service campaign on 
behalf of the disabled."   Nor are the oppressed confined to the alleged 
human species.  Betty Denny Smith, Director of the American Humane 
Association's Los Angeles office, was very concerned about a scene of 
a wolf attacking a man in the movie "White Fang":  "I was very 
concerned about that being an anti-wolf statement."  Those who 
watched the film know that that scene was removed and that the movie 
included a "disclaimer from Defenders of Wildlife saying healthy 
wolves do not attack human beings."   
<P>

Representing the "myth-road-to-self esteem," Beverly Slapin of 
Communities United Against Racism condemns as racist the inclusion 
in American history textbooks of the account of the migration of 
Indians across the Bering Strait to Alaska, whatever may be its claim to 
historical truth.  "Native people say they were created here," she says, 
"that they sprang from Earth, not from Europe or Asia. . . .  [To] 
disregard people's religious beliefs is racist."   Alex Haley, famous as 
the author of Roots, was extremely influential in teaching black 
Americans where to seek self-esteem.  But historians generally regard 
Haley's Roots  as fiction and doubt that he located his actual ancestor.  
Leaving aside the fact that Haley was half Irish and might have written 
a different fiction appealing to Hibernian-Americans had he traced his 
father's rather than his mother's "roots," the uplifting point is that 
mythical roots can be the source of even greater self-esteem than actual 
roots, as most of us descendants of horsethieves can attest.  
<P>

Martin Bernal's Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical 
Civilization, is a sincere effort to "lessen European cultural arrogance" 
by demonstrating the indebtedness of white European civilization to 
black African sources.   Know-ledgeable scholars have amply 
demonstrated the untruth of Bernal's primary claims.  But truth must 
not get in the way of therapy.  As the African-American Baseline 
Essays insist, "the therapeutic effect of history [for black students] can 
be lost, indeed totally defeated, if the African contribution is omitted."  
Therefore black students, and presumably any other students who are 
in the same classroom with them, must be taught that "Since Africa is 
widely believed to be the birthplace of the human race, it follows that 
Africa was the birthplace of mathematics and science."   As Marcus 
Garvey candidly put it, "Things that may not be true can be made true 
if you repeat them long and often enough.  Therefore always repeat 
statements that will give your race status and advantage."   This sage 
advice must presumably be kept from members of the "dominant" race 
or culture.  
<P>

The teachers who teach our public school children are graduates of 
American colleges where such doctrines of multiculturalism are 
rampant.  They then (or concurrently) attend a teacher-training 
institution to learn arcane methodologies for promoting these doctrines.  
There are about 1,300 teacher-training institutions, or "ed schools," in 
America today.  There are about 150 graduate schools of education 
which concentrate more on the study of education than on training 
teachers-preparing education professors, adminis-trators, etc.  The 
approximately 2.8 million public school teachers depend on these 
institutions for the certification that allows them to teach.  
Social critic Rita Kramer recently spent a year visiting and studying 
representative schools of education across the country.  Her conclusion:  
<P>

<blockquote>
At present, our teacher-training institutions, the schools, 
colleges, and departments of education on campuses 
across the country, are producing for the classrooms of 
America experts in methods of teaching with nothing to 
apply those methods to.  Their technique is abundant, their 
knowledge practically nonexistent.  A mastery of 
instructional strategies, an emphasis on educational 
psychology, a familiarity with pedagogical philosophies 
have gradually taken the place of a knowledge of history, 
literature, science, and mathematics. . . . 
<P>

Hardly anywhere did I find a sense that any kind of 
knowledge is valuable in itself or more valuable than any 
other . . . .  What matters is not to teach any particular 
subject or skill, not to preserve past accomplishments or 
stimulate future achievements, but to give to all that stamp 
of approval that will make them 'feel good about 
themselves.'  Self-esteem has replaced understanding as 
the goal of education. . . . 
<P>

The worst of the ed schools are certification mills where 
the minimally qualified instruct the barely literate in a 
parody of learning. 
</blockquote>

<P>
We have succeeded perhaps beyond our expectations in replacing 
knowledge and skills with self-esteem in our students.  American 
students and even their parents "feel good" about their educations.  
While Asian students outperform their American counterparts both in 
reading and in math, the American students are much more likely to 
consider themselves "among the best" in those accomplishments.  And 
around 80 percent of American mothers think their child's school is 
doing a good or excellent job even as one national study after another 
headlines the declining academic performance of the nation's 
students.   The prospect in civics, one supposes, is that Americans 
will feel good about their country as their civic freedoms continue to 
erode and they turn to tribal warfare.
<P>

The not surprising tendency of the multicultural therapy inflicted on 
America's children is to produce students who cannot distinguish 
between right and wrong; who are ignorant of their rights and duties as 
citizens and of the foundations and conditions of their political 
freedom; who have been taught to identify themselves through the skin 
color or surnames of their ancestors; who are ignorant of American 
history and the principles of American democracy or have been taught 
to despise America; who are lacking in basic intellectual 
accomplishments; and who believe that they should feel good about all 
this.   
<P>

Perhaps the most tragic injustice perpetrated against the innocent 
young student by teachers animated by these bad ideas is that he will 
have been denied his greatest birthright as an American.  He will have 
been intellectually and therefore politically exiled from that community 
bound together by what Abraham Lincoln called "the principles and 
axioms of free society":  the community originating in 1776 with the 
bold proclamation of the inalienable rights of man.  Indeed, today's 
student is in a sense divested of his very humanity insofar as he is 
taught to understand himself not as a being possessed of the "rights of 
human nature," but as a member of one tribe asserting his atavistic will 
against other tribes, while possessing no capacity of distinguishing or 
choosing between good and evil.  

<center>
<h3>We Hold These Truths</h3>
</center>

Intelligent liberal critics of multiculturalism see the problem more 
or less clearly.  As the respected historian of education Diane Ravitch 
says, American schools should say to students from other cultures "that 
wherever they have come from, wherever their parents have come 
from, they are now preparing to be American citizens. . . .  They must 
learn about American history, the Declaration of Independence, the 
Con-stitution, and the Bill of Rights, because this is now part of their 
precious heritage as American citizens."   So far so good.  But in 
inviting children from other cultures to become American, Ravitch 
would have them understand that "the unique feature of the United 
States is that its common culture has been formed by the interaction of 
its subsidiary cultures. . . .  Paradoxical as it may seem, the United 
States has a common culture that is multicultural."  "Our story is one of 
diverse peoples meeting, mingling, and changing each other."    But it 
is hardly unique for a "common culture" to be formed from "subsidiary 
cultures."  Nor is America's uniqueness to be found in diverse people 
mingling with and changing one another.  Lawrence Auster, a 
respectful critic of Ravitch's position, points out that her view "turns 
out to be virtually identical in key respects" with the multiculturalism 
she criticizes.   But, typical of the conservative response to 
multiculturalism, Auster offers as a remedy the affirmation of 
America's "Anglo-Saxon" roots.   Alex Haley for the WASPs?  
<P>

Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., offers a useful analysis of the phenomenon 
of multiculturalism in his popular little book, 
<i>The Disuniting of America:  Reflections on a Multicultural Society</i>.  
In response to the tribalism inherent in the multicultural view, 
Schlesinger says that "what has held the American people together in 
the absence of a common ethnic origin has been precisely a common 
adherence to ideals of democracy and human rights."   But these 
ideals which Americans are supposed to hold in common become very 
slippery in Schlesinger's hands.  "The American Creed . . . is an ever-
evolving philosophy."  It is "history" that gives us our "values."  
"People with a different history will have differing values.  But we 
believe that our own are better for us.  They work for us; and for that 
reason we live and die by them."   Certainly in proclaiming the 
"American Creed" in 1776, Thomas Jefferson had no intention of 
proclaiming an "ever-evolving philosophy."  He meant to proclaim 
what Lincoln understood him to have proclaimed, "an abstract truth, 
applicable to all men and all times."  This is the "paradox" and 
uniqueness of America, that for the first time in history a particular 
people established a particular political community on principles not 
peculiar to them but rooted in human nature itself.  
<P>

America began with a ringing affirmation of a fundamental moral 
and political truth:  "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain inalienable rights."  Certainly, here was no appeal to skin color 
or ethnicity.  The truth of human equality and liberty was asserted 
against all despotisms of race, class, or religion.  Neither is this an 
appeal to "history" or an invocation of "Anglo-Saxon" roots.  America 
is distinguished by being founded on an idea, the idea of the equal 
rights of human nature.  We do not "live and die" for this idea because 
"it works for us" or because it is "our own."  We make it our own 
because it is true.  And having been elevated by making it our own, we 
pledge "our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor" to its 
vindication.  No nation or people in history had ever established its 
political institutions on such principles.  
<P>

There is no question that these ideas were generated and 
implemented by what the multiculturalists refer to as dead, white, 
European males-DWEMs to use the popularized acronym.  Are we 
then to believe that they should be confined to beings of that 
description?  That the blessings of liberal democracy "belong" only to 
the particular race or culture or gender that gave rise to it?  This was 
never the belief of Washington, or Jefferson, or Lincoln who did so 
much to secure these blessings for their posterity.  They believed 
themselves to have the high honor of securing and transmitting 
imperfectly and in one small place a universal inheritance, the 
birthright of all humanity.  They never for a moment found the 
authority of their ideas in the time, or race, or culture of those who 
proclaimed them or established them in the fundamental laws of their 
country.  The authority of their ideas lay, simply, in their truth.  That 
men throughout most of history (and throughout most of the world still 
today) tyrannized one another in an infinite variety of ways was not 
proof that human beings do not possess equal rights by nature-rather it 
was proof of how rare and difficult a thing it is to secure them.  It is 
proof of the philosophic rigor, the high moral discipline, the rare 
political sagacity, and-one must add-the great good fortune that is 
required for reflection and free choice to prevail over ignorance, 
prejudice, accident, and force.  Nothing short of such rigor, and 
sagacity, and luck will solve our current educational problems.
<P>

Proclaiming that all men everywhere and at all times possess by 
nature equal rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, the 
American founders undertook the historic effort to secure these rights, 
so far as they thought they could then be secured, to a small people at a 
particular place and time.  They were acutely conscious of the limits of 
their ability to secure these rights.  When they were able to establish a 
"more perfect union" they understood full well how far from perfection 
they remained.  It was all the new republic could do in the first century 
of its existence to keep the experiment in freedom from failing 
miserably at home, as the principles espoused in the American 
revolution slowly and uncertainly began to take hold on the minds, if 
not yet in the politics, of other peoples in the world.  
<P>

In the course of their history, the American people have many times 
fallen beneath the high standards they set for themselves at the 
beginning.  They have strayed from those principles, and they have 
forgotten them, and become confused about them, and allowed 
misunderstood self-interest to obscure them.  The reason that Abraham 
Lincoln is rightly regarded as the greatest democratic statesman is that 
he kept America from abandoning those principles as the foundation of 
American democracy.  His statesmanship preserved for future 
generations of Americans the moral truth of human equality as the pole 
star of their political life: 
<P>

<blockquote>
a standard maxim for free society, which should be 
familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, 
constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly 
attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly 
spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the 
happiness and value of life to all people of all colors 
everywhere.    
</blockquote>

<P>
To begin to restore American public education today, it is necessary 
to restore the moral and intellectual horizons within which the self 
evident truths of America's founding can command the respect and 
allegiance they deserve; within which the life and death choices 
required of citizens and statesmen can appear as something other than 
arbitrary assertions of ethnicity, or history, or gender.  Within such 
horizons, among the variety of regimes that come to light in principle 
and in history, Americans can justly appreciate why Lincoln might say 
of America, that here "We find ourselves under the government of a 
system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends 
of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former 
times tells us."   
<P>

The "genius" of the American people at the time of the founding 
made it both possible and necessary to establish a regime based on the 
principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.  As 
Jefferson said in explaining the genesis of the Declaration, the ideas 
expressed in it were "the common sense of the subject" in America.  He 
was merely expressing "the American mind."   It was only because 
the American people had learned to embrace republican principles that 
it was possible to establish an American republic.  The Founders were 
animated by "that honorable determination which animates every 
votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on the capacity 
of mankind for self government."   But they understood that this was 
a capacity that Americans would have to demonstrate for themselves, 
and continue to demonstrate each generation.  As the Declaration 
proclaims, the just powers of government are derived from "the consent 
of the governed."  Only a people prepared to consent to a republic are 
capable of establishing one.  This means a people prepared to recognize 
their own humanity and that of their fellow citizens; who will neither 
aspire to be masters nor submit to be slaves; who are prepared to rule 
and be ruled in turn; who are prepared to abide by the laws they claim 
the right to make for themselves.  A people that means to be free must 
have the virtues necessary to sustain their freedom.  Do we?
<P>

It is up to this generation, as it has been up to each generation that 
preceded us and will be up to each generation that succeeds us, to 
demonstrate our capacity for self government.  This we do for our own 
sake and for the sake of the cause to which our country was dedicated 
some two centuries ago.  What we prove capable, or incapable, of 
doing about the present state of American education will reflect not 
only on ourselves but on the prospects of free government itself.  
<P>

<blockquote>
The American people owe it to themselves , and to the 
cause of free Government, to prove by their establishments 
for the advancement and diffusion of Knowledge, that 
their political institutions . . . are as favorable to the 
intellectual and moral improvement of Man as they are 
conformable to his individual & social Rights.  What 
spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than 
that of Liberty & Learning, each leaning on the other for 
their mutual & surest support?

<P>
When presidents, and governors, and educators talk about the crisis 
of American education, they often emphasize the need for a highly 
skilled work force in this technologically progressive world.  And there 
is such a need.  One should add that the ability to earn a decent living, 
and to have the self sufficiency and the responsibility that comes with 
that, is a great foundation of individual liberty, moral responsibility, 
and self government.  But job training and liberal education are two 
distinct things, and institutions of public education exist primarily for 
the latter.  The reasons for this are not always as apparent to the student 
as they might be.  Indeed, they are not always as apparent as they 
should be to our presidents, governors, and educators.  A reflection on 
not so ancient history reminds us of the importance of this distinction.  
<P>

In the autumn of 1942, in the midst of world war, informa-tion was 
smuggled out of Nazi Germany through neutral Switzerland revealing 
to the outside world "the extent of the German slaughter of Jews on the 
eastern front, the murder by gas of Polish Jews in three special 'death' 
camps at Chelmno, Belzec, and Treblinka, and of the deportation of 
Jews from France, Belgium, and Holland to an 'unknown destination' in 
the East."   It was only two years later that this 'unknown destination' 
was identified as Auschwitz, where Jews were being gassed at the rate 
of about 12,000 men, women, and children a day.  As Churchill wrote 
at the time, this was "probably the greatest and most horrible crime 
ever committed in the whole history of the world, and it has been done 
by scientific machinery by nominally civilized men." 
<P>

The German people were the most technically advanced-one might 
say highly educated-people in the world at that time.  Doctors, nurses, 
psychologists, educators, scientists, engineers, accountants, lawyers, 
and the whole array of other highly skilled and nominally educated 
men and women, were devoting their considerable skills, acquired at 
great effort and expense, to the extermination of a people.
<P>

Our century, the most technologically advanced century in history, 
with more technically skilled people per square mile than could once 
have been imagined, stands out as a century in which genocide is a 
term with which every grade school child must become familiar.  As 
communism takes its much awaited departure from the world, let us not 
forget the Bolshevik extermination of the Kulaks, the millions 
sacrificed to China's political experiments, and of course the killing 
fields in Cambodia-all in the name of scientific socialism and progress, 
but in fact amounting to a new phenomenon in the world:  scientific 
savagery.
<P>

More generally, if less dramatically, human beings throughout 
history have proven as apt to use their acquired skills to take advantage 
of one another as to confer benefits on one another.
What does this tell us about education and about the distinction 
between liberal education on the one hand and the acquisition of 
competence or technical skill-job training-on the other?  It points to the 
very heart of the matter.  Every art, or craft, or profession, or technical 
skill may be used in the service of justice or injustice, good or evil.  
They may be used to dignify our humanity or to degrade it, to free us 
or to enslave us.  For this reason, it is critical that we learn to do what is 
right as we arm ourselves with such great power to do wrong.  
<P>

Turgot's full inscription on a portrait of Benjamin Franklin reads, 
Eripuit Fulmen Coelo Sceptrumque Tyrannis ("He snatched the 
lightning from the heavens and the sceptre from tyrants").  This tribute 
to Franklin indicates how "liberty and learning," in Madison's phrase, 
may be mutually supportive and how technical skills and liberal 
education are vitally connected.  The prototype of the modern 
educational reform movements in America came in response to the 
launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union, by which tyranny may be 
said to have ascended into heaven (with grave earthly consequences).  
Americans energetically set about to ensure that the coming generation 
of American citizens would have the technical competency to 
withstand the threat of communist tyranny armed with the most 
sophisticated modern technology.  This effort, of course, assumed that 
Americans would have the courage to stand up to this threat-a courage 
founded in the conviction that American freedoms were worth fighting 
for.  Slavish cowards with good math and science skills are no match 
for technologically advanced tyrants.  Today, as third world tyrants are 
arming themselves with nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, 
Americans appear to be in as much need of courage and conviction as 
of technological competence.

<h3>The NEA and Local Control of Our Schools  </h3>
</center>

One of the chief obstacles to effective reform of American public 
education is the powerful centralized union of public school teachers, 
the National Education Association.  The NEA is the most powerful 
trade union in America.  It boasts a membership around 2.1 million.  It 
has 52 state-level affiliates and around 13,000 local-level affiliates.  All 
local members and state members are automatically national members, 
paying an average $400 a year in dues, most of which goes into the 
coffers of the state and national organizations.  One estimate of the 
total dues collected at all levels in 1992-93 is a whopping $750 million.  
<P>

Providing the main pool of teachers to the nation's public schools, the 
NEA is a "near-monopoly supplier to a government-enforced 
monopoly consumer."  The NEA also exerts a powerful influence on 
school management and on curriculum.  As a public sector union, the 
NEA's power is more political than economic, and its essential interest 
is increasing government spending and preventing competition from 
the private sector.  
<P>

"[T]he union's growing power has exactly coincided with the 
dismal spectacle of rising spending on education producing 
deteriorating results."  In 1962, the percentage of public school 
teachers in collective bargaining units was zero.  By 1992, that 
percentage had risen to 80 percent.  Teachers' salaries, which in 1945 
averaged $14,770 a year (in 1992 dollars), rose to $35,334 by 1992.  
This does not include fringe benefits worth another 25 percent after 
taxes.  Per pupil spending was $974 in 1945 (again in 1992 dollars) and 
by 1992 had risen to $5,216.  Average national SAT math scores were 
493 and verbal scores were 470 in the late 1940s.  Both rose in the '50s, 
then began their notorious declines through the '60s and '70s, levelling 
off in the '80s to stand in 1992 at 476 and a dismal 423, respectively.  
<P>

According to former U.S. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, 
"After the post office, schools are the most unionized activity in 
America. . . .  [T]hey are often the largest lobby in the state."  The NEA 
is extremely political and extremely partisan, and proud of it.  "You're 
looking at the absolute heart and center of the Democratic Party," says 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett.  The first time the 
NEA endorsed a presidential candidate was in 1976, when they 
endorsed Jimmy Carter.  The NEA proudly claims to have been the 
largest single bloc at the Democratic National Convention since 1976.  
At the 1992 Democratic convention, one in eight delegates were NEA 
members endorsing Bill Clinton.  The NEA sent posters celebrating the 
Clinton victory in January 1993 to some 26,000 junior high and middle 
schools.  Your tax dollars at work.  
<P>

NEA methods and interests were displayed in the NEA-affiliated 
California Teachers Association efforts in 1992 to prevent the placing 
of a school choice initiative on the ballot.  Methods included blocking 
citizens' access to the petition in shopping malls.  CTA President D.A. 
Weber explained that "There are some proposals that are so evil that 
they should never even be presented to the voters," and compared the 
school choice initiative to an effort to empower the Ku Klux Klan or 
legalized child prostitution.  These are the people of whom Bill Clinton 
said, "If I become President, you'll be my partners.  I won't forget who 
brought me to the White House."  
<P>

As powerful and pervasive as the NEA is, there is at least the 
possibility that its hold on American public education can be broken.  
In a 1992 Gallup poll, "only half the American people supported 
private-school vouchers."  In 1993, this had risen to 70 percent.  School 
choice initiatives have been cropping up across the country, and the 
more there are the more difficult it is for the NEA to concentrate its 
considerable resources against them.  
<P>

Twenty-two percent of NEA teachers put their own children in 
private schools.  This is twice the national average.  Presumably they 
know what they are doing and can afford to do it.  Parents send their 
children to private schools when they can afford to for the simple 
reason that private schools are better than public schools.  One reason 
for this is that private schools must respond to market forces while 
public schools do not have to respond to these forces.   Public schools 
are much more highly unionized than private schools and have a much 
more difficult time firing bad teachers.  Public school principals also 
have much more difficulty hiring the teachers they may want.  Private 
school teachers are more satisfied with their jobs, have fewer sick 
leaves, better attendance and all this for less money and without 
unions.  "Private school teachers are trading economic compensation 
and formal job security for superior working conditions, professional 
autonomy, and personal fulfillment.  Public school teachers are doing 
precisely the opposite."   "[I]t is instructive that the private schools, 
which are products of an institutional system that decentralizes power 
to the producers and immediate consumers of educational services, 
tend to develop precisely the sorts of organizational characteristics 
reformers want the public schools to have."   
<P>

Schools tend to do better when they must respond to the parents and 
students who have the greatest stake in the schools' performance.  That 
means parents must be able to withdraw their children and send them to 
another school.  Politicians and bureaucrats and special interests have a 
great stake in preventing parents from doing this and retaining the 
control they have over our public schools.  This is why there is 
resistance to vouchers.  But the country has a stake in wresting control 
of its public schools from the centralized bureaucrats, interest groups, 
and unions and returning it to local parents.  Maybe fewer mothers 
would "feel good" about their child's education if they thought there 
was an alternative.  An added virtue of vouchers is that they would 
reduce the need for the extremely costly army of bureaucrats with bad 
ideas currently supported by our education tax dollars.  
<P>

Some knowledgeable and experienced people advocate the 
establishment of various kinds of national standards and tests to 
improve the performance of our public schools, and there has been 
some minimal success in applying national standards.   And the 
opposition to such proposals from education interest groups like the 
NEA suggests that such measures may have at least some potential for 
holding the education monopoly accountable for their performance.  
The problem is that to implement any national standards and tests will 
likely subject the standards and tests in the process to the entrenched 
interest groups and ideologues who have done so much damage to 
American education already.   Although there is certainly a national 
interest in elevating the standards of American public education, this 
interest may be best served by giving the opportunity to the parents 
whose interests are most at stake to see that their children get the 
educations they deserve.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

At the end of the American War of Independence James Madison 
wrote an Address to the States, endorsed by Congress and by George 
Washington, recommending measures to secure the fragile 
independence that had just been won.  He concluded with a reflection 
that sheds light on what is at stake in the education of American 
citizens in our own day:
<P>

<blockquote>
[T]he citizens of the United States are responsible for the 
greatest trust ever confided to a political society.  If 
justice, good faith, honor, gratitude and all the other 
qualities which enoble the character of a nation and fulfill 
the ends of government be the fruits of our establishments, 
the cause of liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre, which 
it has never yet enjoyed, and an example will be set, which 
cannot but have the most favourable influence on the 
rights of Mankind.  If in the other side, our governments 
should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these 
cardinal and essential virtues, the great cause which we 
have engaged to vindicate, will be dishonored and 
betrayed; the last and fairest experiment in favor of the 
rights of human nature will be turned against them; and 
their patrons and friends exposed to be insulted and 
silenced by the votaries of tyranny and usurpation.  
</blockquote>

<h3>Statements on Religion and Politics:  Washington to Bush</h3>

The purpose of the following collection of statements is to show 
the extraordinary agreement among presidents throughout America's 
history concerning the proper relationship between religion and 
politics.
<P>

This agreement affirms two principles: first, that there must be a 
separation of church and state, and the government must not favor or 
support one sect in preference to others; but second, that the principles 
of human freedom and equality ultimately rest on the moral and 
religious convictions of the American people, and that if those 
convictions ever fail, liberty will not survive.
<P>

We include statements by all of the presidents from Franklin 
Roosevelt to George Bush, and statements by some of the more 
important presidents from Washington to Coolidge.  At the end, we 
also include famous statements by Alexis de Tocqueville and Supreme 
Court Justice William O. Douglas.

<h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON</h3>

Farewell Address (excerpt)<BR>
September 19, 1796
<P>

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political 
prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports.  In 
vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should 
labour to subvert these great Pillars of human happiness, these 
firmest props of the duties of Men and citizens.  The mere 
Politician, equally with the pious man ought to respect and to 
cherish them.  A volume could not trace all their connections with 
private and public felicity.  Let it simply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious 
obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of 
investigation in Courts of Justice?  And let us with caution indulge 
the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion.  
Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education 
on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid 
us to expect that National morality can prevail in exclusion of 
religious principle.
<P>

'Tis substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary 
spring of popular government.  The rule indeed extends with more 
or less force to every species of free Government.  Who that is a 
sincere friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to 
shake the foundation of the fabric?
<P>

Promote then as an object of primary importance, Institutions 
for the general diffusion of knowledge.  In proportion as the 
structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is 
essential that public opinion should be enlightened. . . .

Letter to the Hebrew congregation of Newport, 
Rhode Island (excerpt)<BR>
August 17, 1790
<P>

It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the 
indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the 
exercise of their inherent natural rights.  For happily the 
government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no 
sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who 
live under its protection should demean themselves as good 
citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support. . . .  
May the children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, 
continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, 
while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, 
and there shall be none to make him afraid.

<h3>THOMAS JEFFERSON</h3>

Notes on Virginia, Query 18 (excerpt)<BR>
1787
<P>

And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we 
have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of 
the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?  That they are 
not to be violated but with his wrath?  Indeed I tremble for my 
country when I reflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep 
for ever. . . .

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

Report to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, University 
of Virginia (excerpt)<BR>
October 7, 1822
<P>

. . . in conformity with the principles of our constitution, 
which places all sects of religion on an equal footing, with the 
jealousies of the different sects in guarding that equality from 
encroachment or surprise, and with the sentiments of the 
legislature in freedom of religion, manifested on former occasions, 
they had not proposed that any professorship of divinity should be 
established in the University; that provision, however, was made 
for giving instruction in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin languages, 
the depositories of the originals, and of the earliest and most 
respected authorities of the faith of every sect, and for courses of 
ethical lectures, developing those moral obligations in which all 
sects agree.  That, proceeding thus far, without offense to the 
constitution, they had left, at this point, to every sect to take into 
their own hands the office of further instruction in the peculiar 
tenet of each.
<P>

It was not, however, to be understood that instruction in 
religious opinion and duties was meant to be precluded by the 
public authorities, as indifferent to the interests of society.  On the 
contrary, the relations which exist between man and his Maker, 
and the duties resulting from those relations, are the most 
interesting and important to every human being, and the most 
incumbent on his study and investigation.  The want of instruction 
in the various creeds of religious faith existing among our citizens 
presents, therefore, a chasm in a general institution of the useful 
sciences. . . .

<h3>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</h3>

Proclamation Appointing a National Fast Day (excerpt)<BR>
March 30, 1863
<P>

Whereas, the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing 
the Supreme Authority and just Government of Almighty God, in 
all the affairs of men and of nations, has, by a resolution, requested 
the President to designate and set apart a day for National prayer 
and humiliation.
<P>

And whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men, to own 
their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess 
their sins and transgressions, in humble sorrow, yet with assured 
hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and 
to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures 
and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed 
whose God is the Lord.
<P>

And, insomuch as we know that, by His divine law, nations 
like individuals are subjected to punishments and chastisements in 
this world, may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil 
war, which now desolates the land, may be but a punishment, 
inflicted upon us, for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of 
our national reformation as a whole People?  We have been the 
recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven.  We have been 
preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity.  We have 
grown in numbers, wealth and power, as no other nation has ever 
grown.  But we have forgotten God.  We have forgotten the 
gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and 
enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the 
deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced 
by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.  Intoxicated with 
unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the 
necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to 
the God that made us!
<P>

It behooves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended 
Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and 
forgiveness.
<P>

Now, therefore . . . I do, by this my proclamation, designate 
and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of 
national humiliation, fasting and prayer.  And I do hereby request 
all the People to abstain, on that day, from their ordinary secular 
pursuits, and to unite, at their several places of public worship and 
their respective homes, in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and 
devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to 
that solemn occasion.
<P>

Let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the Divine 
teachings, that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high, 
and answered with blessings, no less than the pardon of our 
national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering 
Country, to its former happy condition of unity and peace.

Second Inaugural Address (excerpt)<BR>
March 4, 1865
<P>

On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all 
thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war.  All 
dreaded it-all sought to avert it. . . .
<P>

One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not 
distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern 
part of it.  These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful 
interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the 
war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the 
object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by 
war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to 
restrict the territorial enlargement of it.  Neither party expected for 
the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already 
attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might 
cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each 
looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and 
astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; 
and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem strange 
that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge 
not that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be 
answered; that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty 
has His own purposes.  "Woe unto the world because of offenses! 
for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by 
whom the offense cometh!"  If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, 
must needs come, but which, having continued through His 
appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both 
North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by 
whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure 
from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God 
always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope-fervently do we 
pray-that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.  Yet, 
if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-
man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, 
and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by 
another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years 
ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord, are true 
and righteous altogether."
<P>

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in 
the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish 
the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him 
who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his 
orphan-to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a 
lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

<h3>THEODORE ROOSEVELT</h3>

"The World of Micah: The Religion of Service" (excerpt)<BR>
1917
<P>

The most perfect machinery of government will not keep us as 
a nation from destruction if there is not within us a soul.  No 
abounding material prosperity shall avail us if our spiritual senses 
atrophy.  The foes of our own household shall surely prevail 
against us unless there be in our people an inner life which finds its 
outward expression in a morality not very widely different from 
that preached by the seers and prophets of Judea when the 
grandeur that was Greece and the glory that was Rome still lay in 
the future.
<P>

In his Farewell Address to his countrymen, Washington said:  
"Morality is a necessary spring of popular government . . . and let 
us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be 
maintained without religion.  Whatever may be conceded to the 
influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, 
reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national 
morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."
<P>

Washington lacked Lincoln's gift of words; but not Lincoln 
himself possessed more robust common sense in the thought that 
lies back of words.  In this case the thought is not new-only a few 
good thoughts are new; but it was given expression at a time when 
the European movement with which the American people were in 
most complete sympathy-the French Revolution-had endeavored 
to destroy the abuses of priestcraft and bigotry by abolishing not 
only Christianity but religion, in the sense in which religion is 
properly understood.  The result was a cynical disregard of 
morality and a carnival of cruelty and bigotry, committed in the 
names of reason and liberty, which equalled anything ever done by 
Torquemada and the fanatics of the Inquisition in the names of 
religion and order.  Washington wished his fellow countrymen to 
walk clear of such folly and iniquity.  As in all cases where he 
dealt with continuing causes his words are as well worth pondering 
now as when they were written. . . .
<P>

In this actual world a churchless community, a community 
where men have abandoned and scoff at or ignore their religious 
needs, is a community on the rapid down-grade.  It is true that 
occasional individuals or families may have nothing to do with 
church or with religious practices and observances and yet 
maintain the highest standard of refined ethical obligation.  But 
this does not affect the case in the world as it now is, any more 
than the fact that exceptional men and women under exceptional 
conditions have disregarded the marriage tie without moral harm 
to themselves interferes with the larger fact that such disregard if 
at all common means the complete moral disintegration of the 
body politic. . . .

<h3>WOODROW WILSON</h3>

Address in Trenton, New Jersey (excerpt)<BR>
October 1, 1911
<P>

There are great problems, ladies and gentlemen, before the 
American people.  There are problems which will need purity of 
spirit and an integrity of purpose such as has never been called for 
before in the history of this country.  I should be afraid to go 
forward if I did not believe that there lay at the foundation of all 
our schooling and of all our thought this incomparable and 
unimpeachable Word of God.  If we cannot derive our strength 
thence, there is no source from which we can derive it, and so I 
would bid you go from this place, if I may, inspired once more 
with the feeling that the providence of God is the foundation of affairs, and that only those can guide, and only those can follow, 
who take this providence of God from the sources where it is 
authentically interpreted. . . .
<P>

The happiness of seeing a great company of people like this 
gathered together in the interest of the Sunday School is the 
happiness of knowing that there are they who seek light and who 
know that the lamp from which their spirits can be kindled is the 
lamp that glows in the Word of God.
<P>

Every Sunday School should be a place where this great book 
is not only opened, is not only studied, is not only revered, but is 
drunk of as if it were a fountain of life, is used as if it were the 
only source of inspiration and of guidance.  No great nation can 
ever survive its own temptations and its own follies that does not 
indoctrinate its children in the Word of God; so that as school 
master and as Governor I know that my feet must rest with the feet 
of my fellowmen upon this foundation, and upon this foundation 
only; for the righteousness of nations, like the righteousness of 
men, must take its source from these foundations of inspiration.

<h3>CALVIN COOLIDGE</h3>

"Authority and Religious Liberty" (excerpt)<BR>
September 21, 1924
<P>

[The Founders] did not deny the existence of authority.  They 
recognized it and undertook to abide by it, and through obedience 
to it secure their freedom.  They made their appeal and rested their 
cause not merely upon earthly authority, but in the very first 
paragraph of the Declaration of Independence asserted that they 
proposed "to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate 
and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God 
entitle them."  And as they closed that noble document in which 
they submitted their claims to the opinions of mankind they again 
revealed what they believed to be the ultimate source of authority 
by stating that they were also "appealing to the Supreme Judge of 
the world for the rectitude of" . . . their "intentions."
<P>

When finally our Constitution was adopted, it contained 
specific provision that the President and members of the Congress 
and of state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officials, 
should be qualified for the discharge of their office by oath or 
affirmation.  By the statute law of the United States, and I doubt 
not by all States, such oaths are administered by a solemn appeal 
to God for help in the keeping of their covenants.  I scarcely need 
to refer to the fact that the houses of the Congress, and so far as I 
know the state legislatures, open their daily sessions with prayer.  
The foundation of our independence and our Government rests 
upon our basic religious convictions.  Back of the authority of our 
laws is the authority of the Supreme Judge of the World, to whom 
we still appeal for their final justification. . . .
<P>

What a wide difference between the American position and that 
imagined by the vagabond who thought of liberty as a glorious 
feast unprotected and unregulated by law.  This is not civilization, 
but a plain reversion to the life of the jungle.  Without the 
protection of the law, and the imposition of its authority, equality 
cannot be maintained, liberty disappears and property vanishes.  
This is anarchy.  The forces of darkness are traveling in that 
direction.  But the spirit of America turns its face towards the light. 
<P>

It seems to me perfectly plain that the authority of law, the 
right to equality, liberty and property, under American institutions, 
have for their foundation reverence for God.  If we could imagine 
that to be swept away, these institutions of our American 
government could not long survive. . . .

"The Inspiration of the Declaration" (excerpt)<BR>
July 5, 1926
<P>

[W]hen we come to a contemplation of the immediate 
conception of the principles of human relationship which went into 
the Declaration of Independence we are not required to extend our 
search beyond our own shores.  They are found in the texts, the 
sermons, and the writings of the early colonial clergy who were 
earnestly undertaking to instruct their congregations in the great 
mystery of how to live.  They preached equality because they 
believed in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.  
They justified freedom by the text that we are all created in the 
divine image, all partakers of the divine spirit.
<P>

Placing every man on a plane where he acknowledged no 
superiors, where no one possessed any right to rule over him, he 
must inevitably choose his own rulers through a system of self 
government.  This was their theory of democracy.  In those days 
such doctrines would scarcely have been permitted to flourish and 
spread in any other country.  This was the purpose which the 
fathers cherished.  In order that they might have freedom to 
express these thoughts and opportunity to put them into action, 
whole congregations with their pastors had migrated to the 
colonies.  These great truths were in the air that our people 
breathed.  Whatever else we may say of it, the Declaration of 
Independence was profoundly American. . . . 
<P>

A spring will cease to flow if its source be dried up; a tree will 
wither if its roots be destroyed.  In its main features the 
Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document.  It is a 
declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions.  Equality, 
liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man-these are not 
elements which we can see and touch.  They are ideals.  They have 
their source and their roots in the religious convictions.  They 
belong to the unseen world.  Unless the faith of the American 
people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of 
our Declaration will perish.  We can not continue to enjoy the 
result if we neglect and abandon the cause. . . .

<h3>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT</h3>

Address at George Rogers Clark Memorial, 
Vincennes, Indiana (excerpt)<BR>
June 14, 1936
<P>

It is not a coincidence that this service in dedication of a noble 
monument takes place on a Sunday morning.  Governor McNutt 
and I, aware of the historic relationship of religion to this 
campaign of the Revolution, and to the later Ordinance of 1787, 
have understood and felt the appropriateness of today.
<P>

Clark had declared at Kaskaskia before he began his famous 
march, that all religions would be tolerated in America.  Eight 
years later the Ordinance of 1787, which established the territory 
northwest of the Ohio River, provided that "no person demeaning 
himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molested 
on account of his mode of worship or for religious sentiments in 
the said territory."  And the Ordinance went on to declare further 
that "religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means 
of education shall forever be encouraged."  It seems to me that one 
hundred and forty-nine years later the people of the United States, 
in every part thereof, could reiterate and continue to strive for the 
principle that religion, morality and knowledge are necessary to 
good government and the happiness of mankind.

Annual Message to Congress (excerpt)<BR>
January 4, 1939
<P>

Storms from abroad directly challenge three institutions 
indispensable to Americans, now as always.  The first is religion.  
It is the source of the other two-democracy and international good 
faith.
<P>

Religion, by teaching man his relationship to God, gives the 
individual a sense of his own dignity and teaches him to respect 
himself by respecting his neighbors.
<P>

Democracy, the practice of self government, is a covenant 
among free men to respect the rights and liberties of their fellows.
International good faith, a sister of democracy, springs from 
the will of civilized nations of men to respect the rights and 
liberties of other nations of men.
<P>

In a modern civilization, all three-religion, democracy, and 
international good faith-complement and support each other.
Where freedom of religion has been attacked, the attack has 
come from sources opposed to democracy.  Where democracy has 
been overthrown, the spirit of free worship has disappeared.  And 
where religion and democracy have vanished, good faith and 
reason in international affairs have given way to strident ambition 
and brute force.
<P>

An ordering of society which relegates religion, democracy and 
good faith among nations to the background can find no place 
within it for the ideals of the Prince of Peace.  The United States 
rejects such an ordering, and retains its ancient faith.

Letter to the Honorable Samuel I. Rosenman, President 
of the Jewish Education Committee (excerpt)<BR>
December 16, 1940
<P>

Our modern democratic way of life has its deepest roots in our 
great common religious tradition, which for ages past has taught to 
civilized mankind the dignity of the human being, his equality 
before God, and his responsibility in the making of a better and 
fairer world.
<P>

Everywhere in the world there are men of stout heart and firm 
faith now engaged in a great spiritual struggle to test whether that 
ancient wisdom is to endure, or whether it must give way to the 
older, discarded doctrine that some few men shall dominate 
multitudes of others and dictate to them their thinking, their 
religion, their living.  This conflict has found its most terrible 
expression in a war which has now engulfed a large portion of 
humanity.  In its more peaceful aspects, the same struggle also 
pervades all efforts of men of good will who are seeking through 
democracy the way to the world to come.
<P>

In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need 
the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious 
teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization.  For 
"not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God" 
shall our democracy be founded.
<P>

I hope that your Committee and all American citizens will 
continue to strive to bring a new, fresh vigor into the teaching and 
lessons of religion for the children of our beloved land.

<h3>HARRY S TRUMAN</h3>

Address to the Federal Council of Churches (excerpt)<BR>
March 6, 1946
<P>

We have just come through a decade in which forces of evil in 
various parts of the world have been lined up in a bitter fight to 
banish from the face of the earth . . . religion and democracy.  For 
these forces of evil have long realized that both religion and 
democracy are founded on one basic principle, the worth and 
dignity of the individual man and woman.  Dictatorship, on the 
other hand, has always rejected that principle.  Dictatorship, by 
whatever name, is founded on the doctrine that the individual 
amounts to nothing; that the State is the only thing that counts; and 
that men and women and children were put on earth solely for the 
purpose of serving the State.
<P>

In that long struggle between these two doctrines, the cause of 
decency and righteousness has been victorious.  The right of every 
human being to live in dignity and freedom, the right to worship 
his God in his own way, the right to fix his own relationship to his 
fellow men and to his Creator-these again have been saved for 
mankind.
<P>

The fight to preserve these rights was hard-won.  The victory 
took a toll of human life and treasure so large that it should bring 
home to us forever how precious, how invaluable, is our liberty 
which we had just begun to take for granted.
<P>

Now that we have preserved our freedom of conscience and 
religion, our right to live by a decent moral and spiritual code of 
our own choosing, let us make full use of that freedom.  Let us 
make use of it to save a world which is beset by so many threats of 
new conflicts, new terror, and new destruction. . . .
<P>

If men and nations would but live by the precepts of the 
ancient prophets and the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, 
problems which now seem so difficult would soon disappear.
That is the great task for you teachers of religious faith.  This 
is a supreme opportunity for the Church to continue to fulfill its 
mission on earth.  The Protestant Church, the Catholic Church, and 
the Jewish Synagogue-bound together in the American unity of 
brotherhood-must provide the shock forces to accomplish this 
moral and spiritual awakening.  No other agency can do it.  Unless 
it is done, we are headed for the disaster we would deserve.  Oh 
for an Isaiah or a Saint Paul to reawaken this sick world to its 
moral responsibilities!

<h3>DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER</h3>

Address to the National Conference of Catholic 
Charities (excerpt)<br>
September 26, 1960
<P>

The American people accept as a clear responsibility the 
combating of privation and suffering.  The growth in private 
philanthropic contributions in the past ten years has exceeded 
both the rate of growth of our population and our personal 
income. . . . 
<P>

Now this responsibility is not laid upon us by any constitutional or legal mandate.  Our belief, that men are brothers in 
divine origin and destiny, is a part of our religious heritage that 
reaches back to the hills of Galilee and imposes upon each of us a 
spiritually-rooted obligation.  Moreover, the methods by which 
we discharge this obligation must conform to the true spirit of the 
giver.  And, today, they involve a lasting and fruitful partnership 
between citizens and their government. . . 
<P>

Against the dangers inherent in the attitude and announced 
purposes of a powerful, secretive dictatorship, we steadfastly 
maintain the military, moral, economic and political strength to 
assure the nation's safety.  Further, knowing that peace and 
freedom are weakened if not shared, we help other nations which, 
like ourselves, uphold the dignity of men and maintain their 
liberty.  But in spite of these inescapable burdens, America, if true 
to herself, will never be tempted to abandon her noble goals.  
For close to two centuries our nation has thrived under the 
bracing influence of belief in God and the dignity of the 
individual.  Should this spiritual base of our society ever become 
dimmed, our faith in the destiny of America would disappear 
before a vain reliance on materialism, and crass political 
maneuver.
<P>

Then, even should we seem, for a while, victorious over world 
circumstances and all visible foes, we would be tragic 
losers-robbed of our heritage in ideals and our destiny as a leader 
for world peace with justice.  An apparent triumph would become 
a soon-exposed illusion.  A materialistic America-bereft of 
spiritual purpose-could be nothing more than a rudderless ship of 
state, and eventually a victim of the fury of international storms 
and internal decay.
<P>

That tragedy will never be visited upon us so long as our 
churches and our synagogues and chapels-and people who believe 
in God and in themselves-continue to give of their spirit, of their 
time, and of their substance, that they may be secure and their 
fellow men may have faith and hope and courage. . . .

<h3>JOHN F. KENNEDY</h3>

Remarks at the Dedication Breakfast of 
International Christian Leadership, Inc. (excerpt)<BR>
February 9, 1961
<P>

This country was founded by men and women who were 
dedicated or came to be dedicated to two propositions:  first, a 
strong religious conviction, and secondly a recognition that this 
conviction could flourish only under a system of freedom.
I think it is appropriate that we pay tribute to this great 
constitutional principle which is enshrined in the First Amendment 
of the Constitution:  the principle of religious independence, of 
religious liberty, of religious freedom.  But I think it is also 
important that we pay tribute and acknowledge another great 
principle, and that is the principle of religious conviction.  
<P>

Religious freedom has no significance unless it is accompanied by 
conviction.  And therefore the Puritans and the Pilgrims of my 
own section of New England, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, the 
Catholics of Maryland, the Presbyterians of North Carolina, the 
Methodists and the Baptists who came later, all shared these two 
great traditions which, like silver threads, have run through the 
warp and the woof of American history.

Remarks to the Trustees of the Union of 
American Congregations (excerpt)<BR>
November 13, 1961
<P>

I think, as the Rabbi said, that the significance of this 
ceremony is not merely a gift of an ancient document, but that in 
a very real sense the great issue today is between, as he said, the 
supremacy of the moral law which is initiated, originated, and 
developed in the Bible, and which has special application here 
today.
<P>

I've never felt that we should attempt to use the great impulse 
towards God and towards religion, which all people feel, as an 
element in a cold war struggle.  Rather, it's not an arm, it is the 
essence of the issue-not the organization of economy so much but 
the supremacy of moral law, and therefore the right of the 
individual, his rights to be protected by the state and not be at the 
mercy of the state.
<P>

In the Inaugural Address, which the Rabbi mentioned, I said 
that the basic issue was that the rights the citizen enjoyed did not 
come from the state but rather came from the hand of God.  And 
it's written here [pointing to the Torah].  And it is written in the 
Old and New Testaments.

A Proclamation for a National Day of Prayer (excerpt)<BR>
October 8, 1963
<P>

Our forefathers declared the independence of our Nation "with 
a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence."  In that 
reliance, they set forth the conviction that all men are created equal 
and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
<P>

More than a century and three-quarters after our Nation was 
dedicated to that proposition, it may truly be reaffirmed that "We 
are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme 
Being."  Conscious of that religious character of our people, the 
Congress of the United States by a joint resolution of April 17, 
1952, provided that "The President shall set aside and proclaim a 
suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of 
Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God 
in prayer and meditation, at churches, in groups, and as individuals."

<h3>LYNDON B. JOHNSON</h3>

Remarks to a Group of Civil Rights Leaders (excerpt)<BR>
April 29, 1964
<P>

[F]rom the time of the ancient Hebrew prophets and the 
dispersal of the money changers, men of God have taught us that 
social problems are moral problems on a huge scale.  They have 
demonstrated that a religion which did not struggle to remove 
oppression from the world of men would not be able to create the 
world of spirit.  They have preached that the church should be the 
first to awake to individual suffering and the church should be the 
bravest in opposing all social wrongs.
<P>

This tradition is deeply imbedded in America's history.  During 
the middle of the 19th century, men of God, men of all faiths, men 
of the North, men of the South, took to pulpits, to press, yes, even 
out into the public squares to demand an end to the moral evil of 
slavery.  As a consequence, we took the chains off the slaves. . . .
Today, as we meet here a century later, we are faced with and 
we are given another great opportunity.  Today, as we meet here, 
again the problem of racial wrongs and racial hatreds is the central 
moral problem of this Republic.  Today, as we meet here in the 
first house of the land, again hostility and misunderstanding and 
even violence awaits the man who attempts to translate the 
meaning of God's love into the actions and the thoughts of this 
world and this time.
<P>

Today, again the hope for happiness of millions of Negro 
Americans is going to be profoundly affected by your efforts.  And 
today, again, religion has one of those rare, historical opportunities 
to renew its own purpose, to enhance the dignity of its own social 
role, to strengthen its institutions, and its heritage. . . .
<P>

[L]aws and government are, at best, coarse instruments for 
reminding social institutions or illuminating the dark places of the 
human heart.  They can deal only with the broadest and the most 
obvious problems, constantly guarding against segregation in 
schools but not against the thousands of incidents of discrimination 
and hatred which give the lie to what is learned there in the 
schoolroom.
<P>

They can call for the highest standards of moral conduct, but 
those standards are only tortuously imposed on a community 
which does not accept them, for laws do not create moral 
convictions.  Those convictions must come from within the people 
themselves, and it is your job, as men of God, to reawaken the 
conscience of your beloved land, the United States of America.

<h3>RICHARD M. NIXON</h3>

Remarks at the 17th Annual Presidential 
Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<BR>
January 30, 1969
<P>

In these days in which religion is not supposed to be fashion-
able in many quarters, in these days when skepticism and even 
agnosticism seems to be on the upturn, over half of all the letters 
that have come into our office have indicated that people of all 
faiths and of all nations in a very simple way are saying:  "We are 
praying for you, Mr. President.  We are praying for this country. . . . 
As I read those letters I realized how great was my responsibility and how great was your responsibility, those who 
share with me these days in Government.
I realize that people whom we will never meet have this deep 
religious faith which has run through the destiny of this land from 
the beginning.
<P>

I realize that we carry on our shoulders their hopes, but more 
important, we are sustained by their prayers.
I say to all of you joining us here today . . . you have inspired 
us.  You have given us a sense of the continuity of history which 
brings us together from the beginning to now.  You have told us in 
a very simple and eloquent way that, great as the problems are 
which now confront us, with faith, faith in our God, faith in the 
ideals of our country . . . we are going to be able to make these 
next years great years for this Nation and great years for the world.
I believe that and it is to that end that we dedicate ourselves 
today.  That objective transcends all partisan considerations.  I am 
proud to stand here today in the presence of those who, by your 
being here, indicate that you have not lost faith in this Nation.  
You have not lost faith in the religious background that has 
sustained us. . . .

<h3>GERALD R. FORD</h3>

Remarks on Receiving a Collection of 
Day-of-Prayer Proclamations (excerpt)<BR>
July 21, 1975
<P>

I didn't realize until I talked to you and read some material on 
it, but there have been proclamations issued either by a congress or 
the Congress and by the President since June 12, 1775.  I was 
delighted, of course, to issue the proclamation for July 24, 1975.  
The point that I think significant is the following:  Our forefathers 
for almost 200 years have prayed, regardless of their beliefs or 
their faith, and this has helped them, and they are doing it today as 
they have in the past.
<P>

But equally significant, it has been the prayers of our 
forefathers, as it is the prayers of our fellow countrymen today, 
that have made America strong.  And I am convinced, as we move 
ahead, individual prayer will help not only the person but the 
country, and prayer today means as much to Americans as it did on 
June 12, 1775.

<h3>JIMMY CARTER</h3>

Remarks at the Presidential Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<BR>
February 2, 1978
<P>

The leaders of our Nation look with a great deal of concern 
over the past experiences when kings and princesses had tied 
themselves to God, to the church, sometimes even in an exalted 
position relative to God, and had cloaked maladministration and 
injustice in the protection of the church.  So, in our Constitution, 
we carefully prescribed that there should be no establishment of 
religion in this country.
<P>

So, we worship freely.  But that does not mean that leaders of 
our Nation and the people of our Nation are not called upon to 
worship, because those who wrote the Declaration of 
Independence and the Bill of Rights and our Constitution did it 
under the aegis of, the guidance of, with a full belief in God.
In our rapidly changing world, we need to cling to things that 
don't change-to truth and justice, to fairness, to brotherhood, to 
love, and to faith.  And through prayer, I believe that we can find 
those things.

<h3>RONALD REAGAN</h3>

Remarks to an Ecumenical Prayer Breakfast (excerpt)<br>
August 23, 1984
<P>

I believe that faith and religion play a critical role in the 
political life of our Nation and always have; and that the 
church-and by that I mean all churches-has had a strong influence 
on the state, and this has worked to our benefit as a Nation.  Those 
who created our country-the Founding Fathers and 
Mothers-understood that there is a Divine order which transcends 
the human order.  They saw the state, in fact, as a form of moral 
order, and felt that the bedrock of moral order is religion.
The Mayflower Compact began with the words, "In the name 
of God, amen."  The Declaration of Independence appeals to 
"Nature's God," and the "Creator," and "the Supreme Judge of the 
world."  Congress was given a chaplain, and the oaths of office are 
oaths before God.
<P>

James Madison in the Federalist Papers admitted that in the 
creation of our Republic he perceived the hand of the Almighty.  
John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, warned that 
we must never forget the God from whom our blessings flowed.
George Washington referred to religion's profound and 
unsurpassed place in the heart of our Nation quite directly in his 
Farewell Address in 1796.  Seven years earlier, France had erected 
a government that was intended to be purely secular.  This new 
government would be grounded on reason rather than the law of 
God.  By 1796, the French Revolution had known the Reign of 
Terror. And Washington voiced reservations about the idea that 
there could be wise policy without a firm moral and religious 
foundation.  He said, "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead 
to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable 
supports.  In vain would that man [call himself a patriot] who 
[would] labour to subvert these . . . firmest props of the duties of 
men and citizens.  The mere Politician . . . [and] the pious man 
ought to respect and to cherish [religion and morality]."  He added, 
". . . let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can 
be maintained without religion."
<P>

I believe that George Washington knew the City of Man cannot 
survive without the City of God; that the Visible City will perish 
without the Invisible City.
<P>

Religion played not only a strong role in our national life, it 
played a positive role.  The abolitionist movement was at heart a 
moral and religious movement.  So was the modern Civil Rights 
struggle.  And throughout this time, the state was tolerant of 
religious belief, expression, and practice.  Society, too, was 
tolerant.
<P>

But in the 1960s, the climate began to change.  We began to 
make great steps toward secularizing our Nation and removing 
religion from its honored place.
<P>

In 1962, the Supreme Court in the New York prayer case 
banned the compulsory saying of prayers.  In 1963, the Court 
banned the reading of the Bible in our public schools.  From that 
point on, the courts pushed the meaning of the ruling ever 
outward, so that now our children are not allowed voluntary 
prayer.  We even had to pass a law-pass a special law in the 
Congress just a few weeks ago-to allow student prayer groups the 
same access to schoolrooms after classes that a Young Marxist 
Society, for example, would already enjoy with no opposition.
The 1962 decision opened the way to a flood of similar suits.  
Once religion had been made vulnerable, a series of assaults were 
made in one court after another, on one issue after another.  Cases 
were started to argue against tax-exempt status for churches.  Suits 
were brought to abolish the words "Under God" from the Pledge 
of Allegiance, and to remove "In God We Trust" from public 
documents and from our currency.
<P>

Today, there are those who are fighting to make sure voluntary 
prayer is not returned to the classrooms.  And the frustrating thing 
for the great majority of Americans who support and understand 
the special importance of religion in the national life-the 
frustrating thing is that those who are attacking religion claim they 
are doing it in the name of tolerance and freedom and open-mindedness.  Question:  Isn't the real truth that they are intolerant 
of religion?  That they refuse to tolerate its importance in our 
lives?
<P>

If all of the children of our country studied, together, all of the 
many religions in our country, wouldn't they learn greater 
tolerance of each other's beliefs?  And is that not to be desired?  If 
children prayed together would they not understand what they 
have in common and would this not indeed bring them closer?  I 
submit to you that those who claim to be fighting for tolerance on 
this issue may not be tolerant at all.
<P>

When John Kennedy was running for President in 1960, he 
said that his church would not dictate his presidency any more than 
he would speak for his church.  Just so-and proper.  But John 
Kennedy was speaking in an America in which the role of 
religion-and by that I mean the role of all churches-was secure.  
Abortion was not a political issue; prayer was not a political issue; 
the right of church schools to operate was not a political issue; and 
it was broadly acknowledged that religious leaders had a right and 
a duty to speak out on issues of the day.  They held a place of 
respect; and a politician who spoke to or of them with a lack of 
respect would not long survive in the political arena.  It was 
acknowledged then that religion held a special place, occupied a 
special territory in the hearts of the citizenry.
<P>

The climate has changed greatly since then.  And since it has, it 
logically follows that religion needs defenders against those who 
care only for the interests of the state.
<P>

There are, these days, many questions on which religious 
leaders are obliged to offer their moral and theological guidance.  
And such guidance is a good and necessary thing.  To know how a 
church and its members feel on a public issue expands the 
parameters of debate.  It does not narrow the debate.  It expands it.
The truth is, politics and morality are inseparable.  And as 
morality's foundation is religion, religion and politics are 
necessarily related.  We need religion as a guide; we need it 
because we are imperfect.  And our Government needs the Church 
because only those humble enough to admit they are sinners can 
bring to democracy the tolerance it requires in order to survive.
A state is nothing more than a reflection of its citizens; the 
more decent the citizens, the more decent the state.  If you practice 
a religion-whether you are Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or guided 
by some other faith-then your private life will be influenced by a 
sense of moral obligation.  So, too, will your public life.  One, you 
see, affects the other.
<P>

The churches of America do not exist by the grace of the state; 
the churches of America are not mere "citizens" of the state.  The 
churches of America exist apart-they have their own vantage point, 
their own authority.  Religion is its own realm; it makes its own 
claims.
<P>

We establish no religion in this country nor will we ever; we 
command no worship, we mandate no belief.  But we poison our 
society when we remove its theological underpinnings; we court 
corruption when we leave it bereft of belief.  All are free to believe 
or not to believe, all are free to practice a faith or not.  But those 
who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief, to 
apply moral teaching to public questions.
<P>

I submit to you that the tolerant society is open to and 
encouraging of all religions.  And this does not weaken us, it 
makes us strong.
<P>

Without God there is no virtue because there is no prompting 
of the conscience; without God we are mired in the material, that 
flat world that tells us only what the senses perceive; without God 
there is a coarsening of the society; without God democracy will 
not and cannot long endure.  And that, simply, is the heart of my 
message:  If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God, 
then we will be a Nation gone under.

[means] that we believe in separation of church and state, but not 
in the separation of morality . . . and state.  While the government 
must remain neutral towards particular religions, it must not . . . 
remain neutral toward values that Americans support. . . .  Our 
work has gone on now for more than 200 years in the Nation-a 
work best embodied in four simple words:  In God we trust.  And 
it was to that higher being that George Washington looked when in 
1776 he was addressing his troops, and he said, "The fate of 
unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and 
conduct of this army."
<P>

Lincoln believed in divine providence.  Leaving Spring-field . . 
. to assume the Presidency, he told the people of his hometown 
that the God which helped General Washington must now help 
him.  "Without the assistance of the divine being," Lincoln said, "I 
cannot succeed.  With that assistance, I cannot fail."  And [on D-
day], over a nation-wide network, Franklin Roosevelt prayed for 
the safety and success of our invading force.  "Our sons," he said, 
"pride of our nation, lead them straight and true.  Give strength to 
their arms, stoutness to their hearts, stead-fastness to their faith."  
Our history tells us what our hearts confirm:  As Americans, 
we are a religious people.  We prize compassion and self-sacrifice.  
We know that America is great because America is good. . . .  
Several weeks ago . . . I went to a high school in a relatively 
affluent rural area, Lancaster [Pennsylvania], and there we 
discussed a problem which is America's problem-the rising use of 
drugs. . . .  [T]hen, after meeting with this relatively affluent 
group, and hearing that drugs were in their corridors and in their 
playgrounds, I went a few miles over-just the same community to 
meet with the Amish and Mennonite leaders . . . and they don't 
have a drug problem.  And they made very clear to me why:  
family and faith.  Against them, drugs don't have a chance. . . .
I thought of those values last Sunday when I was in New York 
to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's first 
Inaugural Address.  For it was then that, like Washington two 
centuries ago, Barbara and I prayed at St. Paul's Chapel, there 
where in 1789 a prayer service was offered by the chaplains of 
Congress for the United States of America. . . .  Washington 
realized that political values without moral values, without that 
moral underpinning, cannot sustain a nation.

Alexis de Tocqueville, 1856
<P>

I have sometimes asked Americans whom I chanced to meet in 
their own country or in Europe whether in their opinion religion 
contributes to the stability of the State and the maintenance of law 
and order.  They always answered, without a moment's hesitation, 
that a civilized community, especially one that enjoys the benefits 
of freedom, cannot exist without religion.  In fact, an American 
sees in religion the surest guarantee of the stability of the State and 
the safety of individuals. . . . Yet there is no country in the world in 
which the boldest political theories of the eighteenth-century 
philosophers are put so effectively into practice as in America.  
Only their anti-religious doctrines have never made any headway 
in that country, and this despite the unlimited freedom of the press.

<h3>Justice William O. Douglas, 1952</h3>

We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a 
Supreme Being.  We guarantee the freedom to worship as one 
chooses.  [We] sponsor an attitude on the part of government that 
shows no partiality to any one group and that lets each flourish 
according to the zeal of its adherents and the appeal of its dogma.  
When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with 
religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to 
sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then 
respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the 
public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not 
would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the 
government show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That 
would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those 
who do believe.

Answers to Questions  Commonly <BR>
Asked  by Modern Liberals <BR>

<h3>1. Is America a Christian nation?</H3>

Constitutionally America is a nation with no official religion.  
Socially and historically, America has been a nation populated largely 
by Christians; a nation, therefore, whose laws reflect a Christian view 
of the world and of the nature of man.
<P>

Any country's laws inevitably reflect the conscience of the people 
or of the dominant element among them, be that element religious or 
secularist.  There is no such thing as a simply neutral society, and 
anyone who tries to tell us that there is trying to con us into agreeing 
with his highly liberal idea of what society ought to be.
<P>

More significantly, all the religions whose adherents were 
numerous enough to be influential in this country were religions of the 
Bible.  However badly people lived up to the teachings of their 
religions, they believed that the world was created by a personal and 
loving God who had given us rules of right conduct to live by in the 
Ten Commandments and the natural moral law.
<P>

Were those people a menace to the republic and to the liberties of 
their fellow citizens?  Or were their beliefs the bedrock on which the 
republic stood, because they furnished it with the moral foundation that 
any society needs if it is not to disintegrate into sheer individualism as 
American society seems to be in danger of doing at the present time?  
We believe the latter-not because we want to impose our religion(s) on 
the country but because we are convinced that society needs a moral 
consensus on certain basic principles of social life.  
<P>

Put another way, the beliefs that impinge most directly and 
importantly on the political and legal order of the country are moral 
rather than purely religious doctrines.  People who disagree about the 
Trinity, the divinity of Jesus Christ or the sacrament of the Eucharist 
can, and often do, agree on such things as the importance of the family 
and the virtues that good citizens ought to practice.
<P>

The lines that divide this country are not the vertical ones that 
separate religious denominations but horizontal ones that cut across the 
denominations.  On one side are liberals of all religious descriptions or 
of no religion at all; on the other are people who maintain the moral 
convictions on which American society has until recently stood.  

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>2. Doesn't allowing prayer in schools violate separation of church 
and state?</h3>

The phrase "separation of church and state" occurs nowhere in the 
Constitution of the United States.  The words of the First Amendment 
are:  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  That is the 
separation of church and state.
<P>

If we look at the only record we have of the debates in the First 
Congress, in which James Madison proposed the amendments that 
eventually became the Bill of Rights, we find the following.  When a 
question was raised about the meaning of establishing a religion, the 
record reports:  "Mr. Madison said, he apprehended the meaning of the 
words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce 
the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in 
any manner contrary to their conscience."
<P>

If opening a meeting (or a session of a school) with a prayer 
violates that conception of "separation of church and state," then 
Congress has been violating it ever since it adopted the First 
Amendment.  The recitation of a prayer which anyone can join or not 
join as he wishes does not legally enforce the observation of a religion 
or compel anyone to worship God in a manner contrary to his 
conscience.
<P>

The Supreme Court has applied the First Amendment to the states 
only since the 1940s, and found school prayer to be "an establishment 
of religion"-wrongly, we think.  The Amendment does not bar 
everything that someone finds objectionable. 

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>3. Wouldn't allowing public funds to support education in church-
related schools violate separation of church and state?</h3>

To violate the First Amendment of the Constitution, an action by 
the state would have to violate either the guarantee against an 
establishment of religion or the guarantee of the free exercise of 
religion.  It is hard to see how letting people's taxes go to the schools 
which their children, or even other people's children, attend deprives 
anyone of the free exercise of religion.  For the parents of children 
going to church-related schools, it would contribute to free exercise.
<P>

Despite what some civil libertarians seem to think, the Constitution 
gives the state no interest in preventing or hampering the religious 
education of children.  The state's only interest is in seeing to it that 
children get an adequate education in secular subjects.  It is not 
necessary that the state should give it to them in state schools.  Church-
related schools regularly teach the usual range of secular subjects, and 
in so doing they serve the state's purpose.  That they also give 
instruction in their religion(s) frustrates no valid state concern.
Nor does it "establish religion" to subsidize the secular instruction 
that such schools give.  But if necessary to satisfy constitutional 
scruples, the state could issue vouchers-not to the schools, but directly 
to the parents of schoolchildren.  After all, they are the ones primarily 
responsible for their children's education.  The state would then let 
them choose the schools in which the vouchers would be used.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>4. Should creationism be taught in the public schools alongside 
evolution?</h3>

If creationism means the story of the creation of the world as we 
find it in the book of Genesis, it is hard to see how a state school could 
teach it without teaching religion, which is not the function of the state.  
It does not follow, however, that the public school must reject as 
unscientific, and therefore untrue, the proposition that the world was 
created by God.  Science knows nothing, one way or the other, about 
that, and the school should not pretend that science does know.
<P>

There are factual grounds for believing that some evolution of 
species has taken place.  But that all living creatures have evolved from 
an original DNA molecule is an overarching explanatory scheme-not a 
demonstrated fact.  It should not be taught as anything more than a 
theory widely held at present by scientists.  Still less should the school 
teach that a universal evolution of species is explained by a process of 
random variation over long periods of time.  That is an explanation that 
constantly gets more out of less and the higher out of the lower, and 
this by accident.
<P>

It raises philosophical (not merely theological) problems to which 
science has no answer because the answers lie beyond the scope of the 
scientific method.  To assume that the scientific method is the only 
method of knowing truth is mere intellectual arrogance, and the schools 
would do well to steer clear of it.  Intellectual modesty will not resolve 
the conflict between science and creationism, but it might help. 

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>5. Is there one monolithic Christian or Judeo-Christian political 
agenda?</h3>

It is hard to see how there could be, since there is no one political 
program that follows necessarily from the Christian or Jewish faiths.  
What can be said is that religious believers who are called conservative 
and traditionalist, and who consider themselves to be orthodox, tend to 
converge on certain basic moral principles that can be applied to social 
and political issues.
<P>

Thus, they believe that human beings, made in the image of God, 
are endowed with intelligence and free will, and are ultimately 
responsible for their own actions.  They also believe that the human 
person and human life enjoy a basic sanctity which society and the 
state must respect.  They therefore believe that no moral question is 
irrelevant merely because it has become a political issue.  After all, 
Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party, said in 
reference to slavery, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God 
is just."  
<P>

To insist that a political issue has a moral dimension is not 
"imposing" a religious belief.  It is an effort to persuade fellow citizens 
to take a certain course of political action on grounds of public 
morality and sound public policy.  The fellow citizens are capable of 
judging for themselves if they are not persuaded.  All that religious 
believers can do is to ask them to listen with a degree of serious 
attention.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>6. Isn't the "religious right" really trying to establish a theocracy in 
America?</h3>

No.  We are not proposing a Christian, Judeo-Christian, or any 
other religious orthodoxy for the pluralistic society of this country.  We 
are only saying that political issues at some point along the line raise 
moral questions.  These questions must be answered in the light of 
some conception of human nature, its basic needs, and its common 
social welfare.  That means that citizens of different beliefs must be 
able to discuss, debate, and come to some decision about public 
policies.  If there is nothing we can agree on about human good, then 
we cannot act as a community.
<P>

In that discussion all citizens may take part; none are excluded 
because their moral beliefs are also religious beliefs.  A person may 
recognize that killing, stealing, and bearing false witness violate the 
rights of others and do injury to the community, as well as violate the 
commandments of God.  In fact, the harm they do to human beings and 
to the community is the reason God has forbidden them.  So long as the 
evil to be remedied or the good to be achieved falls within the 
jurisdiction of the state, beliefs about them are appropriate in the public 
forum.
<P>

Others who do not share our religious beliefs may nonetheless agree 
with the moral beliefs and join with us in advocating certain public 
policies.  All we can hope to do, and all we are trying to do, is to win 
the support for the policies as being in the public interest.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>7. Shouldn't the state stay out of the field of morals and leave it to 
the private consciences of the citizens?</h3>

There are, and always have been, areas of moral conduct into which 
the state does not enter.  On the other hand, there is a public morality 
that the state must protect and even enforce because the welfare of 
society depends on it.  It cannot be left to the private conscience of 
every individual.  Hence American law has long recognized a "police 
power" in the several states; i.e., the power to legislate for the public 
health, safety, welfare, and morals.
<P>

Since the state is not a church, it may not legislate to save our souls 
or to achieve our eternal salvation.  The object of state legislation is the 
common good of the community in this world.  This is a good which 
has moral dimensions and does not consist merely in material welfare.
It is a secular goal, however, inasmuch as it is confined to this 
world.  But it is not therefore a secularist goal, to be pursued only on 
the basis of secularist notions about what human beings are and what is 
good for them.  The state is separate from the church, but it is not 
sealed off from the consciences of citizens which churches have 
instructed.
<P>

No citizen need check his conscience at the door when he enters the 
public forum to take part in the debate on the secular common good 
and the means of achieving it.  For example, that a citizen believes that 
the heterosexual, monogamous family was instituted by God is not a 
reason why he may not urge the traditional family as the norm for 
public policy.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>8. Isn't it wrong for the "religious right" to impose its morality, 
such as its belief about abortion, on others?</h3>

All laws impose rules and norms which are seldom agreed to by all 
members of the community.  Laws are often passed for low and 
partisan reasons, as we all know.  But, theoretically and in principle, 
laws are made to serve justice and the general welfare-and it does not 
invalidate them that they impose norms that not everyone agrees to.
The relevant question is whether the subject of the law is properly 
in the public forum and within the jurisdiction of the state.  Not all 
immoral acts should, therefore, be made illegal as well.  There is no 
moral principle that commands us to make every sin a crime.  But if an 
action seriously harms the common good, it may be forbidden or 
restricted by law, unless doing that will do more harm than good to 
society's welfare.
<P>

Merely saying, or getting the U.S. Supreme Court to say, that an 
action is private in nature does not make it so or remove it from public 
concern and regulation.  Were that the case, one could argue that 
polygamy, sodomy, the use of narcotic drugs, and a good many other 
practices are purely private matters.  If abortion is immune from 
regulation, why not these other things as well?
<P>

Now, whether we define abortion as murder or not, in every case it 
puts an end to a human life.  Surely, if the protection of human life is a 
basic purpose of civil society, that is enough to make abortion a matter 
of public concern, debate, and possible regulation, and not merely a 
matter of religious belief.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>9. Why doesn't the "religious right" think that homosexuals should 
be treated like everyone else?</h3>

This question is like asking why we don't treat polygamists like 
everyone else.  One answer would be that we do treat them like 
everyone else and grant them the same right that everyone has: to 
marry one wife.  In regard to homosexuals, another answer would be 
that they are not like everyone else, precisely in their orientation to 
sexual union with persons of their own sex.  Homosexual unions are 
not oriented to procreation and the family, and calling such unions 
families does not change that fact.
<P>

We should not punish homosexuals for being homosexuals, and we 
need not punish them for homosexual acts (though sodomy laws have a 
certain utility in preventing sodomy from becoming a "right").  But 
neither need we, nor should we, recognize homosexuality as a lifestyle 
as good as any other, and as entitled as marriage to the protection and 
encouragement of the law.
<P>

We certainly do not mean that rapists, pedophiles, philanderers, or 
adulterers are better than homosexuals merely because they happen to 
be heterosexual.  They, too, pervert-or at least abuse-their sexual 
powers.  But behind current homosexual demands lies a certain notion 
of democratic equality which asserts that all appetites are equal.  That 
idea busts the family down to the level of an alternative lifestyle.  No 
society that looks to the next generation and its future as a society can 
afford to entertain it.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>10. Isn't the Biblical view of women outdated?</h3>

Anyone who asks that question should be obliged to explain what 
he (or, more probably, she) thinks the Biblical view of women is, and 
why it is "outdated."  The answer will very likely be the feminist notion 
that women prove their worth and achieve self-fulfillment by careers in 
the workplace.
<P>

The Biblical view of women begins with the book of Genesis 
(1:27):  "God created man in his own image, in the image of God 
created he him; male and female created he them."  The species, man, 
exists in two sexes, which are equally human, equally images of God, 
equally worthy of honor and respect for what they are precisely as men 
and women.
<P>

The Bible also implies that man (the species) is essentially social, 
for the two sexes are designed by nature-and therefore by God-to form 
couples, have children, and raise families.  The basic unit of society is 
not the discrete and separate individual who pursues personal goals in 
competition with other individuals, and who consents to law and 
government only in order to keep the competition from degenerating 
into violence.  Human society begins with, and grows out of, the 
family.
<P>

It does not follow that women have no place in the workforce.  
Women have always worked-usually harder than men.  As society 
develops technologically, they do broader and more varied kinds of 
work.  But, given their essential and distinct role in the family, it is a 
mistake for society to regard them as primarily jobholders and career-
seekers for whom marriage is simply a sacrifice of themselves to their 
husbands.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>11. Isn't the "religious right" opposed to the most basic value of 
American life: the liberty of the individual?</h3>

The liberty of the individual, as liberals too often conceive of it 
today, is not the most basic value of American life.  It is a radical 
individualism that rejects all social norms and institutions that the 
individual has not agreed to.
<P>

The basic American ideal, in a phrase that the Supreme Court 
regularly uses, is "ordered liberty."  We certainly don't agree with some 
of the conclusions the Court has drawn from that phrase.  But it is in 
itself a good one and states the liberty that America was built on.  It is a 
liberty that exists within and depends upon an order of law, of social 
institutions, and ultimately of moral principles that are widely enough 
accepted that we can say that they represent society's consensus.
<P>

The best example of a subject on which we are losing our consensus 
is the family.  But we may regain it.  In the April 1993 Atlantic 
Monthly, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead has presented lengthy and detailed 
evidence for the harm done to children and to society by the spreading 
breakdown of the American family.  The evidence shows that the intact 
family with two biological parents offers children greater security and 
better outcomes in life than single-parent or step-parent families.
Society, as well as children, needs stable, intact families.  When 
men and women commit themselves to such families, they exercise an 
ordered liberty that outweighs their desire for choice, freedom, and 
"self-expression."  Ordered liberty of that type deserves the support of 
a social consensus.

<P>
<hr size=4 align=center>
<P>

<h3>12. Isn't the "religious right" opposed to the other basic value of 
American life:  the equality of all individuals?</h3>

The American idea of equality is that all individuals are by nature 
persons, and as such are endowed with those natural rights that belong 
to persons.  It does not follow that all desires, urges, appetites, and 
drives that persons feel are entitled to equal respect and the equal 
protection of the laws.  Natural rights are based on our common human 
nature, not on our personal idiosyncrasies.
<P>

Nor does equality assume that all ideas and tastes in music, art, 
literature, philosophy, and morals are of equal validity.  That notion of 
equality implicitly denies that there are any standards of judgment by 
which a society would come to conclusions about higher and lower, 
better and worse.  It regards all standards of judgment as purely 
subjective feelings about what individuals like and don't like.
Today this false idea of equality leads people to throw slogans 
around.  Racism, sexism, homophobia, and multiculturism, as now 
commonly used, are not invitations to discussion and rational 
argument.  They are designed to prevent argument and to force us to 
accept ideological views without discussion.
<P>

Proponents of a racial, feminist, homosexual, or multicultural 
agenda certainly have a right to take part in public discussion.  But the 
discussion must eventually come to a conclusion and allow society to

<TITLE>104th Congress Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>1/04/95</P><H1><P>Environmental opportunity and the 104th Congress</P></H1><P>           THE 104th Congress convenes today. Many environmentalists see the new Republican majority as America's repudiation of an environmentally friendly administration. Because the Clinton administration had a green facade, they fear that this change portends environmental doom</P><P>       The Clinton administration has a green posture. Vice President Gore wrote an impassioned green book, &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; George Framton, formerly president of the Wilderness Society, is assistant secretary of Interior. He heads the Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and controls many wilderness areas. Framton reports to Bruce Babbitt, secretary of Interior, a person so revered by environmentalists that they protested the proposed nomination that might have moved him to the Supreme Court.</P><P>     Yet, despite their green rhetoric, the Clinton administration has no substantive environmental accomplishments. Why? They surely had good green intentions. The vice president even recommended that America adopt environmental quality as the &quot;central organizing principal&quot; of culture and policy. But good intentions won't suffice. The administration has failed in its efforts to implement reform.</P><P>     Their pervasive and persistent failure to understand political economy keeps them locked into the centralized planning, &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the century old Progressive Era. This approach has never worked as promised and it generates predictable failures.</P><P>       Many new members of Congress campaigned against activist, interventionist government. Their election provides new and expanded opportunities to those seeking environmental quality and a sustainable economy. The Republicans need to find programs to cut if they are to honor their &quot;Contract with America,&quot; a document Newt promises to read into the Congressional Record each day.</P><P>     But many targets for budget cuts threaten the most vulnerable members of society, e.g., children of single, inner-city parents, rural poor and the homeless. It is hard to defend these cuts without appearing heartless, callused or even cruel and vindictive. Tough love is a hard sell.</P><P>     In contrast, there are many governmental programs and agencies with large constituencies that support environmentally costly and economically wasteful activities. Subsidized clear-cutting of timber in the marginally productive high, dry and cold National Forests of the Rocky Mountains, the killing of wild mammals and birds by the Animal Damage Control agents of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the federal damming of free-flowing rivers to bring subsidized water to crops grown with federal price supports, stored at federal expense and then given away are telling examples of distressingly common phenomena.</P><P>     These environmentally and economically wasteful activities would be highly unpopular if they were well-known. They are not. Most citizens don't understand the bureaucratic arrangements let alone their ecological and economic consequences. The average, generally well-informed citizen knows nothing of these programs. Few citizens can even differentiate the Park Service (in the Department of Interior) from the Forest Service (in the Department of Agriculture). Even fewer understand that the Forest Service sells most of its timber, on average three-fourths of all sales, at a loss totaling about half a billion dollars per year - year after year. This loss persists despite the persistent claim that with their (inherited) inventory of timber, the Forest Service will soon show a profit.</P><P>     Sylvan socialism works like all forms of large-scale socialism: very poorly indeed. As one of my Forest Service friends told me after he retired: &quot;If the Supervisor of a national forest in the Rocky Mountain states regularly auctioned off piles of gold bricks, he would soon lose money on every sale. The bureaucratic process is really that wasteful.&quot;</P><P>       But profit isn't everything and usually not the most important thing. What about environmental quality and economic justice? Again, the federal resource-management agencies fail reasonable tests. The fundamental reasons are straightforward. Bureaucratic decisions, like other decisions, are made on the basis of information and incentives. And political bureaucracies systematically generate bad information and perverse incentives that favor larger appropriations rather than benefits to citizens.</P><P>     When the Progressives of 1900 created these agencies, they simply got it wrong. They expected the federal resource-management agencies to be efficient, environmentally sensitive and to promote equity. One hundred years of experience demonstrates that even competent and well-intentioned bureaucrats are not omniscient and selfless seekers of the public interest. Those who rise to the top and stay there are budget maximizers.</P><P>     No one high in the Clinton administration seems to understand this pathology. It's inherent to bureaucratic politics. Successful advocates of reform must understand this.</P><P>     The new Congress has arrived with refreshingly little baggage. If members are sincere in their protestations against big government and are not sucked into the vortex of established interests, waste will be reduced. The new Congress might build on the previous and useful alliances between the Environmental Defense fund, an economically sophisticated green group, and the National Taxpayers Union, an organization that targets wasteful federal programs. It is not naive to seek change when we understand how the world works.</P><P>     Environmentally concerned citizens can use this change in the orientation of our congressional majority. They can advocate the elimination of environmentally destructive and economically costly programs. If you'd like to promote a harmony between our economy and our ecology, identify a program to be cut and show why cutting it would help. Then write your senators and representative and nominate that program for elimination. And be sure to copy Newt. He deserves help in achieving worthy goals, and to be held accountable for results.</P><P>__________ <BR> John A.

<TITLE>Politicians and Parks Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>1/18/95</P><H1><P>Keep politicians from ruining our parks</P></H1> <P>          THE idea of national parks is one of America's best. Approval ratings exceed 90 percent. But political federal management of the parks is a terrible idea. Politics promotes ecological destruction and ethical corruption</P><P>       Two recent books, &quot;Playing God in Yellowstone&quot; and &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park,&quot; publicize what experts have known for years: our parks' long-term ecological health is seriously threatened.</P><P>     One problem is severe elk overpopulation. Elk in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks far exceed the number the parks can sustain. There are 40,000-50,000 elk in the Yellowstone area, though it is the 20,000 elk inhabiting the northern range and wintering in the park that are the main problem. The burgeoning elk population is rapidly destroying aspen, cottonwood and willow stands and various grasses. Erosion is increasing and vegetative diversity is falling. Antelope, bighorn sheep, moose, mountain lions, ptarmigans, and beaver are among the victims.</P><P>     Why does the Park Service permit elk to degrade the land and ecology in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain? The answer is politics. Until 1967 (1961 in Rocky Mountain), the Park Service culled herds with government hunters. With natural predators and hunting by native Americans virtually eliminated, historic range severely reduced, and relocation no longer an option, slaughtering elk was the only responsible action.</P><P>     But the public sees elk as cute and fuzzy charismatic megafauna that shouldn't be shot. Because the Park Service and its congressional overseers are sensitive to voter pressure, the elk population is exploding even as ecology, land quality and species diversity degrade.</P><P>     Absence of fire is the second problem. Both Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain are fire-driven ecosystems. Fire is crucial for rejuvenating stagnant climax forests because it stimulates the growth of diverse succession species such as aspen and various grasses, shrubs and wildflowers. Lack of fire, particularly in Rocky Mountain, is destroying these species and the animals that depend on them. Before white men imposed a fire-control regime, low-level surface fires cleared away accumulated undergrowth while leaving most mature and healthy trees alive.</P><P>     Ecological vitality is fostered by regular, small-scale burns. But once again, political pressure has made such burns difficult to tolerate, let alone create. Residents of nearby towns dislike smoke and haze from fires. Even controlled fire annoys tourists. And fires may escalate out of control.</P><P>     Ultimately, as fuel accumulates, large fires are inevitable. Without the natural firebreaks created by less severe, more frequent burns and with the huge buildup in deadwood and other fuel (up to 100 tons/acre), a dry year may bring another fire such as that which burned 1.2 million acres of Yellowstone in 1988.</P><P>     Perversely, fires actually help the Park Service. The Park Service is rewarded for uncontrolled fires because Congress grants blank checks for fire fighting. Besides, fighting fires is macho and romantic. As a smoke jumper friend said: &quot;Fires are great! It's just like war but no one shoots back!&quot;</P><P>       Dr. Fred Wagner, director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, notes another reason why destructive elk- and fire-management policies have continued: The people best qualified to criticize have been co-opted by the Park Service. Park Service scientists are well aware of an important ecological principle: Don't bite the hand that feeds you. In a 1989 paper, Wagner notes a recurring theme among researchers working with the parks. They say &quot;Yes, I have some misgivings about what is going on in the parks, but I'm getting research funds from them and I'm not going to rock the boat.&quot; The consequence of this self-censorship is poorly informed policy.</P><P>     To end the ecological damage of political management, we should consider alternative arrangements for park management. Public but nongovernment endowment boards operating under the common law doctrine of &quot;trust&quot; hold great promise. Everyone is familiar with institutions managed by endowment boards: nongovernment schools, nonprofit hospitals and museums are common examples.</P><P>     Each park would have an endowment board. It could be chartered with the legally binding mandate of fostering the values that justified creating that park, e.g. wilderness, waterfowl or wonders. Established environmental groups, local communities and business leaders would nominate people to the board. Each person would be confirmed by Congress, and each park given a modest, one-time-only financial endowment. Free from political interference, the trustees would have responsibility for managing that park in accord with its charter.</P><P>     An endowment board would solicit donations and charge fees just as a museum does. The board would have strong incentives to allow ecologically sensitive commercial activities, as we find on Audubon Society preserves and Nature Conservancy land. In rare cases, some extractive activities would be permitted, but only if they</P><P> complement our national parks' highest values of scenery, preservation and recreation.</P><P>     Freeing the parks from politics is essential to preserving their ecological and cultural legacy. We've had more than 600 years of experience with trusts. By making park managers accountable to a stable board of trustees rather than elected politicians with transient interests, they would be forced to confront the real, long-term consequences of their actions. Freed from the pressures of special interests, humans and nature could seek responsible balance.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

<TITLE>Hunters and Habitat Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/01/95</P><H1><P>Hunting plays a key role in habitat conservation</P></H1> <P>          MANY environmentalists oppose hunting. They find the idea of killing animals for sport repulsive and incomprehensible. For these people, sport hunting is an obsolete remnant of our barbaric past, one excised by civilized cultures</P><P>       This position is empathically understandable, but logically paradoxical because hunters are important supporters of wildlife habitat protection. Hunters save habitat as individuals and through organizations such as Ducks Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ruffed Grouse Society, Quail Unlimited, and North America Wild Sheep Foundation. Sportsmen and women know that without habitat there is no game.</P><P>     Members of the environmental community have recurrently tried to stop hunting on national wildlife refuges, and hunting is forbidden in national parks. Tensions between hunting and the animal-rights wing of environmentalism are complex and emotional. They are wrapped up with New Age religion and with &quot;junk&quot; science that falsely claims animal populations naturally regulate themselves without degrading their habitat. (The latter is a fiction propagated for political reasons by &quot;scientists&quot; within the Park Service.)</P><P>       Tensions also stem from demographic changes that insulate urbanites from nature's unpleasant realities. Prosperity has fostered an appreciation for the intrinsic value of life. But few people understand that predators, harsh winters and extensive range are necessary to preserve healthy wildlife populations. Only if &quot;challenged&quot; individual animals die will healthy populations survive. By eliminating major predators and winter range, people have sharply increased the danger of destructive crashes of whole animal populations.</P><P>     It is simply wrong to argue, as some do, that hunting does not promote environmental protection. Though hunting is not a cure-all, it is an important tool for promoting habitat conservation. It also substitutes for the natural population checks eliminated by human activity.</P><P>     A failure to accept the importance of hunting underlies the actions of John Lilburn, a member of the group, Fund for Animals. In 1990, Lilburn interfered with a state-supervised bison hunt near Yellowstone Park by interposing himself between hunters and the bison. Though we may marvel at his affection for bison, such passion threatens the bison's well being. Without natural predators, bison populations grow beyond their food supply and wander out of the park. They carry brucellosis, a disease causing cattle to abort. In terms of sound wildlife and livestock management, removing the bison was necessary.</P><P>     But, certain environmentalists resent people's enjoyment of hunting. They don't understand or accept that love of the hunt has deep cultural and perhaps biological roots. It is intellectually irresponsible to wish the love of hunting away. By accepting that hunting is loved by millions, environmentalists could tap a powerful reservoir of support for conservation.</P><P>     Hunters already pay big money for sport hunting. The Turner Ranch near Bozeman charges $9000 for a four-and-a-half day trophy elk hunt and limits the number of hunters to 30. These fees compensate the ranch for nearly $250,000 worth of grazing provided to wildlife that is not hunted.</P><P>     In Arizona, a hunter paid $303,000 for a Desert Bighorn sheep permit. That money went for wildlife research and habitat protection. Payment for hunting preserves game habitat and thereby saves less charismatic, but ecologically important species.</P><P>     If landowners and local communities cannot profit from wildlife, they may favor environmentally destructive sources of income, such as poor logging practices, or mining. This lesson holds not only for big-ticket species, but for animals with lower hunting values: deer, elk and waterfowl. Fees from hunting far exceed those from primitive recreation, bird watching, or photography.</P><P>     Hunters are a major force behind Ducks Unlimited (DU), a conservation organization with more than 600,000 members and 3,700 chapters across the United States and Canada. DU manages more than four million acres of wetland in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. It has acquired rights to these wetlands through purchases, leases and easements.</P><P>     The Boone and Crockett Club, founded in 1887, is one of the United States' first conservation organizations. Early on, it helped protect Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. The Club's 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch in Montana is winter range for hundreds of elk and mule deer and harbors grizzly bear, white tailed deer, cougar, eagles, falcons, hawks, and cutthroat trout. It is also home to a research station conducting field work in conservation. Boone and Crockett recently endowed a professorship at the University of Montana through a $1 million gift.</P><P>     A desire to accommodate hunters has changed the forest-management practices of several important timber companies, including Champion, International Paper, and Temple Inland. The companies provide more &quot;edge&quot; along clear-cuts and more diverse ecosystems as they strive to offer habitat for prime game species. These efforts sensitize employees to the importance of wildlife habitat.</P><P>     People love nature in different ways. Not everyone empathizes with today's naive but politically correct preservationist ethic. Most people opposed to hunting are well intentioned. And some people's opposition to hunting is religious. To them, ecological science is irrelevant. But the facts are clear; hunters cannot be dismissed as enemies of animals, and their efforts help preserve healthy ecosystems.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/15/95</P><H1><P>Beltway greens undercut worthy ecological goals</P></H1><P>           &quot;THE Tragedy of the Commons&quot; is the best known article on ecology. It was printed in Science magazine in 1968 and has been reprinted hundreds of times in dozens of fields ranging from anthropology to zoology. Its essential message is profound yet simple: If a valuable resource is open to all, if it is common property and unmanaged, it will be over-exploited. The standard examples are the open range of eastern Montana in the 1880s and unmanaged ocean fisheries. Because of its implications for social as well as natural systems, it is probably the only article written by a biologist that is known by all English-speaking economists</P><P>       The author is Garrett Hardin, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara. As Garrett used the term, &quot;tragedy&quot; is not mere unhappiness or even extreme sorrow over an outcome. Rather, tragedy resides in the solemn and remorseless working of things. Given the incentive for exploitation and the absence of constraints on use, valuable common property resources are exhausted. Ecological and economic waste are the expected consequences. Tragedy is predictable, not a puzzling aberration.</P><P>     I was honored to work with professor Hardin. Our book, &quot;Managing the Commons,&quot; was in print for nearly 15 years. It was the first environmental-studies book that stressed the importance of property rights in promoting stewardship and environmental quality. Professor Hardin is primarily responsible for its success and for teaching me principles with lasting value.</P><P>     Most importantly, Garrett taught me that we are intellectually and ethically obligated to ask the question &quot;and then what?&quot; when we evaluate environmental policy. Good intentions will not suffice. It is irresponsible to ignore predictable problems.</P><P>     But many Beltway environmentalists have done so. The results, the relentless working of things, are coming due. People are resisting new environmental legislation.</P><P>     This resistance seems paradoxical at first glance because the vast majority of Americans value environmental quality. Pollution control, habitat preservation and other green ends are widely accepted. Resistance follows from the means promoted by major national environmental groups.</P><P>     For 25 years, environmental control has been a growth industry led by crisis entrepreneurs who too often ignored costs imposed. Now we see a movement to calculate those costs. It is natural for people to weigh their costs against the benefits they receive. While Washington should keep people from imposing unwarranted burdens on others, it must not impose arbitrary burdens of its own. Opposition to the latter drives efforts to limit unfunded federal mandates.</P><P>     Crises entrepreneurs create or exaggerate &quot;problems,&quot; such as asbestos and pesticide residue, through misrepresentation and junk science. They use the fear and concern aroused in the public to generate funds and use the funds to lobby Congress. Protecting their budgets, not birds and bunnies, seems to be their primary goal.</P><P>     And what is the long-term environmental impact of crisis entrepreneurs? As real science wins out and &quot;crises&quot; are exposed as not so critical, the attentive public becomes skeptical about the importance of all environmental problems. The public also learns that the remedy offered, more federal control, is always too expensive and usually ineffective.</P><P>     Superfund, the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act are all up for renewal. Policy analysts, resource economists and more-enlightened environmentalists question the operation of these acts. Though the goals are legitimate and praiseworthy, the means are at best inappropriate and, at worst, pernicious.</P><P>     In his book, &quot;Breaking the Vicious Circle,&quot; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer noted that many federal regulations require individuals and businesses to spend vast sums to obtain excessive cleanliness. For example, companies involved in a New Hampshire waste dump were forced to pay an additional $9.3 million to further clean a site where children playing on the site could already eat a small amount of dirt each day for 70 years without significant harm. But this was not a playground, it was a swamp. The $9.3 million surely had better uses. Sadly, such mandated waste is common.</P><P>     Environmental quality is not free. When Beltway environmentalists act as though it is, they foster waste and ultimately erode environmental concern. Americans are not rejecting environmental goals. Rather, they are challenging cures that often seem worse than the disease.</P><P>     To sustain public support we must harmonize environmental quality with economic security and liberty. To do so we must seriously consider three approaches castigated by professional greens as the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;:</P><P>       1) Require cost-benefit analysis of alternative regulations so we can direct our energies where they do the most good;</P><P>     2) Limit unfunded federal mandates that constrain state and local governments from addressing local problems;</P><P>     3) Require government to compensate property owners when environmental regulations reduce property's value but not when they control significant externalities or costs foisted on others.</P><P>     These principles have been dismissed with derision by the Beltway greens. But this dismissal is dangerous because it threatens support for worthwhile green goals. As people realize the opportunism and duplicity of crisis entrepreneurs, they may discount the importance of environmental concern and replace it with attention to problems of public health, community, and personal security. It is time for environmental leaders to ask professor Hardin's question - &quot;and then what?&quot; - and advocate innovative means to reach accepted environmental ends. </P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

When they reach 41st Avenue Northeast, the sidewalk ends. These people then wheel themselves into Sand Point's rush-hour traffic and travel down the street until the sidewalk resumes a block later</P><P>       Officials should know that disabled people live in the nearby Burke Gilman Place's &quot;affordable&quot; housing, which was built on city land. And officials should know that the sidewalk ends. But, not yet competent with sidewalks, they are on to light rail, a megaproject.</P><P>     Public &quot;megaprojects&quot; fail with amazing consistency. The RAND Corporation, a major research institute, studied 52 such projects costing an average of $2.4 billion each. These projects were plagued by cost overruns and delays and about half performed less successfully than intended. Rand's study, the WPPSS fiasco, and Denver International Airport strongly imply that massive public works are prone to overly optimistic planning and duplicity.</P><P>     The Regional Transit Plan's (RTP) proposed light-rail project exemplifies how wishful thinking leads to ineffective and unnecessarily expensive public projects. Even though we want everyone else to take the train, the RTP won't alleviate congestion. It will lure us from more-effective traffic-management strategies. Traffic congestion is an important challenge and we probably will spend large sums to deal with it. But we will sorely regret devoting resources to a light-rail system</P><P>       Although more than $20 billion was spent to build and expand rail systems in 14 cities during the 1980s, the number of people using rail to get to work fell in all but one. Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., have expensive rail systems but have not appreciably diminished congestion. More broadly, trips on public transit (of which light rail is only a fraction) actually declined from 9 percent of overall trips in 1970 to just 5.3 percent in 1990.</P><P>     Light rail is unpopular because, for most people, it is slower and less-convenient than driving. On average, a trip that includes a ride on light rail is half as fast as a trip by car because getting to the station, waiting for a train, transferring to and from buses, and making station stops take lots of time. Rail lacks flexibility, rarely going where people want to go. Rush-hour travel between the suburbs and downtown, the type of commute rail handles best, is declining in importance. Moreover, people often make side trips to shop, exercise, or take children to school. These trips are far less convenient because tracks are rarely laid where people want to go.</P><P>     According to the Regional Transit Authority's own figures, the $6.7 billion RTP will add a mere 37,000 daily rides to public transit. This is far less than 1 percent of all commutes. And most of these rail riders are people who now use buses. Instead of paying the estimated $360,000 per new transit rider, we could pay 220,000 people $2000 per year for 15 years to bike to work. Biking, like transit, is a healthy, nonpolluting method of travel.</P><P>     Mass transit fails because, under current arrangements, drivers can ignore the congestion they impose on others. Even with traffic delays, automobiles offer quick, comfortable, convenient transportation for most people. Many women view their car as &quot;a personal security device.&quot; The time we waste sitting in traffic is outweighed by these advantages. Public transit fails by comparison.</P><P>     Congestion toll pricing, charging drivers a fee that rises and falls depending on how heavily the road is used, is a more-effective traffic-management strategy. Tolls make better use of existing roadways by spreading traffic more evenly over the day, encouraging carpooling and biking, and making mass transit more attractive. Tolls reduce the need for costly road expansions or rail systems. They also save time and gas while reducing pollution.</P><P>     Start by placing tolls at major congestion points such as the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and the Ship Canal Bridge. Automated Vehicle Identification and Electronic Toll Collection systems, already used in Oklahoma, Norway and Texas, eliminate backups at toll booths. Tolls would be higher during rush hour and low or nonexistent when few cars are on the road.</P><P>     Ideally, our taxes will fall as tolls are used to finance road repairs and improvements. But even if taxes don't fall, new, congestion tolls are preferable to paying twice for the RTP: once, building light rail and buying buses, and again building roads to handle the vast increase in traffic that the RTP will do nothing about.</P><P>     Ordinary citizens rarely analyze complex policy proposals. Work, family and friends trump people's interest in policy analysis. But public officials have a duty to choose wisely. Even if well-intentioned, their myopic fixation on light rail will lead to a project that is expensive and seldom alleviates congestion.</P><P>     Our region is blessed with a highly educated and civic-minded populace, hi-tech businesses, and past public-works successes. But these blessings do not change human nature or repeal economic principles. Even with large subsidies and good intentions, light rail won't work as promised. Until we try congestion tolls it is irresponsible to commit to light rail.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

Predictions of a timber famine were common among forestry &quot;experts&quot; of the time, especially from Gifford Pinchot, first chief of the Forest Service</P><P>       Pinchot and others correctly noted that timber harvests were far exceeding reforestation, but incorrectly concluded that this was an inherent flaw of private management. The timber famine did not come to pass for two reasons. First, private-sector entrepreneurs anticipated increased timber scarcity and responded with a wide range of innovations. Second, as prices went up, people began to economize on the use of wood.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship is a continual search to preserve or create value in innovative ways. It is what we can expect when property rights are sufficiently secure to justify the risks always involved when trying something new. Experimenting with more productive and ecologically sensitive timber management is an especially risky venture for the time frame is long.</P><P>     Without relatively secure property rights, people think for the near term. Timber famines and short-term management are likely. But, perversely, the Environmental Protection Agency is penalizing entrepreneurs by harassing innovative timber owners. This has the effect of abridging their rights.</P><P>     EPA harassment has recently focused on Simpson Investment Company, a leader in high-yield forestry. I have known people at Simpson for nearly 20 years and have followed their forestry innovations with interest and admiration. In 1988, Simpson began a risky experiment in growing eucalyptus trees on a &quot;fiber farm&quot; near Corning, Calif. Buying 10,000 acres of land in orchard and pasture, Simpson experimented with eucalyptus trees at the edge of that tree's possible range. The chance of failure was high but the potential rewards seemed to merit the risk. Since eucalyptus grows nearly five times faster than native trees, about 500 cubic feet per acre per year, a given plot of land can yield much more fiber for wood pulp than a comparable section of natural forest.</P><P>     There are many benefits to Simpson's experiment. For example, water is conserved by using 7,000 miles of drip irrigation, an approach developed in the deserts of Israel. By planting on land that had been in agriculture for decades, Simpson preserved natural forests.</P><P>     A third benefit is noted by Resources for the Future (RFF), an organization widely respected as the largest and oldest of the natural resource-environmental think tanks. Roger Sedjo, a University of Washington Ph.D., is director of their Forest Economy and Policy Program. His recent paper, &quot;The Global Environmental Effects of Local Logging Cutbacks,&quot; places the environmental consequences of entrepreneurial efforts such as Simpson's Tehama Tree Farm into its larger context.</P><P>     Sedjo notes that international trade in forest products is well-developed. Logging restrictions in one place produce increased logging elsewhere. This is important because logging's environmental impact varies greatly from place to place. Logging old growth or forests with biodiversity or habitat values has more serious environmental effects than logging plantation forests. Sedjo says, &quot;. . . logging in plantation forests is likely to be the most environmentally benign (alternative), especially when these forests are established on former agricultural lands,&quot; exactly the case with Simpson's eucalyptus farms. By increasing the production of plantation forests, Simpson relieves pressures on the natural forests elsewhere.</P><P>     But the EPA chose to ignore Simpson's solid environmental record and the obvious benefits of its California facility. On Jan. 25 and again on Feb. 3, EPA bureaucrats invaded Simpson's premises. Without explanation, they seized privileged documents and threatened to halt the farm's activities. They claimed possible threats to fairy shrimp, a species listed as endangered last November.</P><P>     Though Simpson officials tried to arrange a meeting to determine the cause of EPA's concerns, their efforts were rebuffed. On Feb. 28, Simpson received an administrative order from EPA that may require the company to cease operations at Tehama. Without a single meeting, EPA snuffed a pioneering effort in innovative forestry.</P><P>     This is a tragic, but unsurprising example of the corruption of purpose associated with government bureaucracies. It demonstrates the pathology identified by Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;; bureaucrats single-mindedly carrying the mission of their organization to the point where it does more harm than good.</P><P>     EPA's treatment of Simpson discourages ambitious environmental experiments. Their behavior makes a mockery of EPA's very reason for existence, environmental protection. When we examine this case from a long-term environmental perspective, we understand why the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries such heavy negative baggage.</P><P>     EPA's response to Simpson's experiment gives huge negative incentives to exactly the type of entrepreneurs upon whom our future depends. EPA's actions demonstrate the huge environmental, ethical and economic consequences of giving vast power to government bureaucracies. It would be ironic indeed if the timber famine predicted by the progressives a century ago would finally come to pass due to the arrogance and aggrandizement of their bureaucratic descendants. </P><P>__________<BR>John A.

<TITLE>Earth Day Reconsidered Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>3/29/95</P><H1><P>Earth Day reconsidered: liberty, ecology, prosperity</P></H1> <P>          On April 22 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day. This is also the last time I will teach the environmental policy course I began teaching in 1970 at Indiana University.</P><P>       When I began teaching environmental courses, many of my colleagues looked toward two reforms for ecological salvation: an environmental ethic to regulate behavior and a wise and powerful government to manage for the greatest good, for the greatest number, for the long run. While ethics are indeed important and limited government has value, we have learned since Earth Day not to depend on either.</P><P>     Students in environmental courses still bring some burdensome baggage: well-intended but fundamentally naive ideas regarding the potential of altruism and government action. Unless trained in economics, they come mentally wired with an anti-market, anti-property-rights orientation. They often can't separate their hopes from reasonable expectations for political solutions. They believe that government power is easily harnessed for good ends.</P><P>     Fortunately, as students grow wiser they often reject government command-and-control. They follow the examples of leading academics and environmental writers. These people have learned the perverse, unintended consequences of bureaucratic governance, e.g., ecological damage caused by predator- and fire-control programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P><P>     Skepticism of the notion that government has a nearly boundless power to do ecological good is spreading. For example, John Crutcher, the editor and publisher of Common Ground, a New Age, environmentally sensitive monthly magazine, wrote a March cover story on property rights. In discussing the federal resource agencies, Crutcher notes:</P><P>       &quot;Rather than the public trust being protected, society's preserves have been sacrificed upon the altar of the almighty federal pie - and without even making a profit upon selling out its employer - the taxpayer.&quot;</P><P>       He explains that agencies maximize budgets rather than profits. They compete for market share, scrambling for hunks of the federal budget. Such articles are becoming common in the elite media and even in green magazines, including Northern Lights, High Country News and Sierra. In the popular media as in academia, we're moving up the environmental policy learning curve.</P><P>     One hundred years ago, Progressive era reformers told America that professional management motivated by the public interest and guided by science would work well. Today, economics and history have exposed this dictum as a self-serving myth. Rather than being boundless, the federal government's constructive role is limited to:</P><P>       (1) Providing legal means that enable people to protect themselves from pollution;</P><P>     (2) Supporting basic research;</P><P>     (3) Protecting migratory resources such as waterfowl;</P><P>     (4) Protecting our heritage.</P><P>     When going beyond these assignments, bureaucratic pathologies ultimately prevail.</P><P>     For 25 years, I've explored ways to harmonize liberty, ecology and prosperity. In my judgment, the most important principles are quite clear:</P><P>       First, unless consciously randomized, decisions are made on the basis of information and incentives. This is true whether we are trying to save our souls, soils or seals.</P><P>     But institutions differ dramatically in the quality of information and strength of incentive they generate. And each kind of institution biases the results in some way. Elective politics, for example, rewards the ambitious, rich and duplicitous while placing sincere, honest reformers at a huge disadvantage.</P><P>     The second principle is equally important but carries less analytic power: Character and personal integrity matter a great deal. There are good people who, at least in the short run, can withstand the force of institutions that generate poor information and perverse incentives. For example, I respect and admire individuals who do good work in the bowels of the Forest Service.</P><P>     The above principles tell us that stated mission gives little clue as to actual performance. Here are two examples.</P><P>     The Park Service is to employ science and sound management to protect the integrity of our most valuable natural treasure. Universities are to foster the search for truth. Yet, the Park Service tried to suppress the University Press of Colorado's publication of the book &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park&quot; by Karl Hess, an ecological scientist who had done years of field work in Rocky Mountain Park. To his credit, Luther Wilson, head of the University Press, stood firm, resisted Park Service pressures, and published the book.</P><P>     In contrast, when Alston Chase published his book, &quot;Playing God In Yellowstone: The Destruction of America's First National Park,&quot; Bill Tietz, then president of a university beholden to Park Service favor, fought to keep that book out of Yellowstones' visitors' centers. This is despite the fact that Chase's book has been adopted and recommended by such universities as Harvard, Stanford, Washington and Yale.</P><P>     There is no substitute for character. But character alone cannot consistently produce good policy. Over time, the incentives generated by institutions usually trump ethics by attracting certain types of people. The Forest Service is a friendly environment for those who think science should be subservient to budgetary imperatives. Forest Service employees whose ethics lead them to think otherwise find that promotions are elusive. The Forest Service is not unique; good character will not prevail without good institutions.</P><P>     Thus, successful environmental reform must focus upon institutional design. An important task of stewardship is to create institutions that harmonize private and public interests. Private property rights, markets and voluntary cooperation can foster these ends. After 25 years of trying, I believe I can now tell how this all works.</P><P>__________<BR>John A.

No amount of concern will be enough to avoid environmental harm if information is of poor quality and incentives are perverse. How can we best channel our interest in environmental quality into constructive action? &quot;Least-cost planning&quot; offers one approach.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has two basic components. First, planners must scrutinize their assumptions and consider the feasibility of alternatives when reality does not unfold as planned - and it seldom does. Second, planners must look fairly at all alternatives and select least-cost options, not favored technologies. Least-cost plans tend to select flexible, adaptable options that can be changed when conditions change.</P><P>     Thirty years ago, E.F. Schumacher noted that small is beautiful and that approaches or technologies that fit in one place may not do so in another. Least-cost planners generally agree. The Northwest's Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) fiasco is the catastrophe that launched least-cost planning into the electric and gas utility markets. Can we apply this lesson to inflexible, capital-intensive transportation options, such as light rail, to avoid future financial catastrophes and a resultant disenchantment with government actions at all levels?</P><P>       In 1968, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which markets electricity for the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and publicly owned utilities, began developing its Hydro-Thermal Power Program. In developing this program, BPA made two crucial mistakes.</P><P>     First, it embraced untenable assumptions about the future demand for electricity. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Northwest's consumption of electricity grew by an annual average of 7 percent. Regional power planners assumed these increases would continue indefinitely. They &quot;knew&quot; that neither technological change nor price increases would slake our thirst for electric power.</P><P>     Second, BPA looked at one option, nuclear power, and made an inflexible plan around that option. BPA envisioned utilities constructing and operating 20 undesigned, untested nuclear power plants between 1975 and 1990. The novel nature of the nuclear plants foreshadowed large unanticipated costs.</P><P>     The program carried a price tag of billions. BPA offered a carrot and a stick to the region's utilities to encourage them to commit to the program. The carrot was a financing mechanism that shifted much of the risk onto BPA's rate payers. It remains with us today.</P><P>     BPA Administrator Donald Hodel, Ronald Reagan's future Secretary of Energy, offered the stick in 1976: a warning that after 1983, BPA could no longer guarantee adequate power to the region. (He later replaced Jim Watt as Secretary of Interior.) Hodel proudly called himself &quot;a prophet of shortage.&quot; Utilities signed up. WPPSS started five of the seven nuclear plants it was to build. Puget Power tried siting two plants on the Skagit River. Utilities in Oregon tried siting two nuclear plants at Pebble Creek.</P><P>     However, BPA's program was static, and the economy, like a complex ecosystem, is dynamic.</P><P>     Economic change was as catastrophic to WPPSS as the end of the ice age was to the woolly mammoths. Rising interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s dramatically reduced the attractiveness of capital-intensive investments such as nuclear plants. Industrial demand fell as people responded to higher energy prices. We insulated water heaters and attics, lowered thermostats, and installed double-, triple- and quadruple-paned windows. The projected annual 7 percent increases in consumption dropped dramatically; today, most utilities expect 1-2 percent annual growth.</P><P>     By 1983, WPPSS defaulted on bonds valued at $2.25 billion. Like echoes in a canyon, repercussions of that default continue to echo across the Northwest. Poor planning and perverse incentives led public officials to approve projects that squandered millions of dollars every year.</P><P>     In the end, even fierce resistance by nuclear power enthusiasts, WPPSS insiders, and Wall Street financiers could not staunch the financial hemorrhaging, technical mismanagement, and public disgust with WPPSS.

It was inspired by our first Earth Day 25 years ago. Shortly thereafter, it became a rallying cry for the green revolution</P><P>      For more than 20 years, the idea was widely supported without question. But does a total ban on whaling make scientific sense? Equally important, do advocates of a ban hold the moral high ground?</P><P>       Life is much simpler when we think in black and white. With this binary model, there are good ideas, such as the promotion of liberty, and bad, such as the abuse of government's coercive power. But environmental truths are not so simple; they are often scientifically complex and highly emotional.</P><P>     Complexity and emotionalism can lead to problems, especially when cultural differences collide. Received &quot;truths,&quot; such as &quot;we must ban the harvest of whales,&quot; become cultural imperialism in green camouflage. The whaling issue illustrates these points and helps us clarify thinking on environmental matters more generally. It shows us the importance of probing the superficial appeal of environmental shibboleths.</P><P>     The notion &quot;save the whales&quot; is about as precise as &quot;save the birds.&quot; There are many species of whales, at widely varying risks of extinction. The largest is the great blue whale weighing up to 150 tons and equal in length to a Boeing 737-200.</P><P>     The deadliest is Orcinus orca, the killer whale, which often hunts in packs like an aquatic wolf. The smartest is the bottle-nosed dolphin, whose brain-to-body-weight ratio more closely approximates humans' than any other mammal. And then there's the minke, a small, plentiful whale found in many of the world's oceans.</P><P>     Before we set out to &quot;save&quot; these diverse creatures we should realize three things:</P><P>       --  Many whales species are far from endangered;</P><P>     --  There is no a priori reason to assume that hunting individual whales will extinguish an entire species; and</P><P>       --  We display an arrogant disregard for traditional cultures when we impose the values of our wealthy, highly modernized society upon them. This last point deserves further attention because Western environmentalists often assume their anti-whaling position is the correct one.</P><P>     In Western cultures, whales had substantial commercial value for several centuries. In the Middle Ages, Norwegians, Britons and Germans hunted whales, chiefly for food. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, whales, especially toothed whales such as the sperm, were hunted primarily for their oil, an important input for lighting and soap-making. (&quot;One candlepower,&quot; a unit of light, is defined as the amount of light given off by a pure spermaceti candle burning at a rate of 120 grams per hour.)</P><P>       The U.S. led the world in whaling during the early to mid-19th century, and many coastal New England towns owed their prosperity to the whaling industry.</P><P>     In a classic &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; many species dwindled in numbers and several were threatened with extinction. Since whales were owned only after harpooned and landed, whalers lacked incentives to preserve viable breeding populations. Any whales left could be taken by other whalers. And even if incentives for conservation had existed, scientific information about how to preserve genetically viable populations was sorely lacking. Today, we have better information and know how to create proper incentives.</P><P>     Current blue and humpback whale populations are indeed low, and some species are endangered. The former Soviet Union's recurrent violations of treaties restricting whale harvests took a heavy toll, but members of some other species are plentiful. An example is the minke whale, which has long played a significant role in the Norwegian whaling industry.</P><P>     There may be up to one million minkes. In 1994, 32 Norwegian boats killed a total of 279 minkes out of an estimated regional population of 87,000 whales. This rate of about one-third of 1 percent is biologically trivial and has no significant ecological impact. However, to the centuries-old maritime societies that evolved around whaling, minkes are culturally, economically and nutritionally significant. Minkes support these villages much as buffalo supported the late 19th century Great Plains Indians.</P><P>     Proscribing a total ban on whaling denies cultures time to adjust and ignores the relative abundance of many species. Whatever its environmental and emotional appeal, an absolute ban is cultural imperialism. Can members of &quot;Save the whales!&quot; organizations justify imposing their environmental morality on other cultures? When advocates for a ban ignore scientific evidence that the minke are no more threatened than mallard ducks, their arguments carry a tinge of ethical and intellectual arrogance.</P><P>     In the end, a total ban on all whaling oversimplifies a complex issue. First, not all whales are threatened. Second, we have the technology to create transferable property rights in whales. With such guaranteed rights, whales will not be hunted to extinction. Third, whales are central to traditions of coastal villages in Japan, Norway, and Iceland. Reasonable harvest poses little threat to the continued existence of these animals. In contrast, insensitive, imperialistic Western environmentalism surely threatens these villages when it imposes its tastes on traditional cultures.</P><P>     The lessons here are clear. It would be a mark of maturity for the environmental movement if it applied these lessons to the celebration of Earth Day's 25th anniversary.</P><P> _______<BR> John A.

Her work launched America's modern environmental movement and set the stage for the Earth Day celebration of 1970</P><P>       On April 10, 1995, just a few days short of the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, Greg Easterbrook published an article in the same New Yorker. Distilled from his recent book, &quot;A Moment upon the Earth,&quot; the article focuses on &quot;eco-realism.&quot; Easterbrook convincingly argues that we have greatly improved our environment since Earth Day, though few are ready to admit it.</P><P>     Many fiscal conservatives, free-market aficionados and libertarians are unwilling to recognize our successes. They resist evidence that government programs are sometimes effective (though rarely efficient). Many modern liberals are reluctant to admit even partial victory. Some fear a relaxation of effort while others seek to profit by perpetuating the perception of crisis. Nevertheless, the gains are real.</P><P>     Lake Washington, Puget Sound, Lake Erie, and many other bodies of water have made ecological comebacks. Airborne lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and automobile hydrocarbon emissions have declined from 24 percent to 96 percent, significantly improving air quality in America's cities. Some wildlife populations have rebounded. For example, the wild turkey, an important indicator species, was nearly extinct but is now more widely distributed than in colonial times.</P><P>     Other environmental improvements have occurred without federal encouragement. The Atlantic Monthly's April feature story discussed the impressive and ongoing reforestation of the eastern United States. The much-maligned profit motive has spurred private enterprise to reduce consumption of natural resources and lower the generation of solid and toxic waste. And in the 1980s, private land trusts exploded as an important, local method for preserving millions of acres of land.</P><P>     In spite of its successes, the post-Earth Day legacy of environmental protection has serious flaws. It emphasized rigid federal laws and regulations that are often monstrously inefficient and massively inequitable. The inefficiency, by wasting resources, means environmental protection is more likely to conflict with other important goals, especially when government budgets are tightening. Inequity, by imposing costs on a small number of people, encourages heated resistance to programs that are supposed to pursue worthwhile goals. For example, opposition to the Endangered Species Act continues to grow because the costs of species protection are concentrated on relatively few land owners.</P><P>     Until recently, inefficiency and inequity were of little concern to single-minded seekers of environmental quality.</P><P>     This is partly because we could achieve large gains in environmental quality for relatively little time, money, and inconvenience. But, as America grows cleaner, easy gains become more elusive. In economists' parlance, we encounter the problem of diminishing marginal returns. The next 5 percent of a specific environmental gain may cost more than the first 90 percent, the next 2 percent more than the previous 95 percent. Opportunity costs grow as we seek ever deepening shades of green.</P><P>     In addition, environmental regulations often hide regulatory costs by placing them on businesses, and letting the businesses pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. With the public largely unaware of the monetary and social costs of environmental regulations, lawmakers and bureaucrats have little reason to worry about efficiency or equity.</P><P>     Public indifference is complemented by political self-seeking and opportunism. Bureaucrats at EPA, OSHA and FDA, whose jobs depend on regulating even trivial or nonexistent risks, have powerful incentives to cast an ever wider net of ever tighter regulations, just to keep their people working and their budgets growing.</P><P>     Legislators impede our movement toward environmental quality by carving out protections for powerful constituencies. For example, the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments required smokestack scrubbers be installed at many coal-burning power plants rather than promoting low-sulfur coal. Scrubbers were chosen even though they did little for air quality because the use of low sulfur coal would have harmed eastern coal miners and the political careers of their congressmen.</P><P>     Finally, many private environmentalists must share the blame for our misguided approach to environmental protection. They seek regulations that promote their narrow interests, frequently by foisting costs on less-organized or less-politically powerful groups. Public monies and state coercion are used to promote private or organizational interests at the expense of the public good.</P><P>     Greenpeace, for example, has made efforts to restrict the industrial use of chlorine compounds, a class of substances very useful in a broad array of manufactures (which in turn contribute to America's health and welfare). Other organizations have supported legislation, such as log-export bans, that dramatically reduce property values and alienate the people who can best promote conservation.</P><P>     As additional increments of environmental quality become more expensive and the costs of these increments become more visible, public resistance will stiffen. For example, the rise of the Wise Use movement partially reflects legitimate concerns with the concentration of environmental costs on rural landowners.</P><P>     Much progress has been made since Earth Day 1970. But the easy solutions are behind us. To continue to improve our environment we must consider how we can minimize the burdens we impose on ordinary citizens as we pursue necessary environmental goals. This is the challenge for our next 25 years.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.

<TITLE>Regional Transit Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/10/95</P><H1><P>Regional transit: learning the hard lessons of WPPSS</P></H1><P>           COUNTY executives from King, Pierce and Snohomish counties recently sent a letter to the state Legislature asking for a &quot;transportation summit&quot; to address a broad range of issues related to transportation in the Puget Sound region. The proposed two-day summit, tentatively scheduled for June, represents an excellent opportunity to educate legislators and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) about least-cost analysis</P><P>       On March 14, voters in portions of these three counties rejected the Regional Transit Authority's proposed Regional Transit System. Without a doubt, they had many motivations for voting &quot;no.&quot; What is clear is that voters have moved much farther up the learning curve than the RTA's backers.</P><P>     Transportation bureaucracies across the U.S. show a consistent bias toward capital-intensive, inflexible systems that require continuing, expensive bureaucratic oversight. Voters, who after all are the ones who have to pay for this idea, have expressed their belief that we can reduce travel times, pollution and stress more cheaply and effectively by other means.</P><P>     One approach is to apply least-cost planning to transit. This is not easy, but few important things are. It took the WPPSS fiasco to thrust least-cost planning upon the electric-utility industry. And as King Cushman (Director of the Transportation Planning Department at the Puget Sound Regional Council) correctly cautions, transit is an inherently more complex area than electric power.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has been used for years in the electric industry and it may take years to make it similarly useful for transit. Nevertheless, least-cost planning has proven useful in addressing the complex and changing Northwest power market; it could also help us evaluate our transit options.</P><P>     The mission of least-cost planners is to satisfy various demands at the lowest total cost. This is important because there are many worthy tasks competing for our limited public resources. Adopting relatively cheap, highly effective solutions first allows us to adjust and meet demands more quickly.</P><P>     The first principle of least-cost planning is to find options consistent with our goals. In its own master plan, the RTA found Western Washington's proposed $6.7 billion transit system would not significantly reduce traffic congestion or automobile-related air pollution.</P><P>     Who would seriously consider a plan that fails to accomplish its primary goals? Is the RTA seriously trying to diminish congestion, or does it have another agenda? If so, what is it?</P><P>       The second principle is to study all options fairly. WPPSS failed in part because planners looked at nuclear power through rose-colored glasses. Many people, myself included, have a romantic view of trains. This may cloud our perception of light rail as it appears in the regional transit plan. But only a bureaucracy spending other peoples' money could indulge a romantic association with trains to the tune of $6.7 billion.</P><P>     Whenever anyone proposes additional taxes to raise money for public projects, we should look critically at our options. This seems especially difficult when it comes to trains. In &quot;A Desire Named Streetcar,&quot; U.S. Department of Transportation analyst Don Pickrell reviewed transit plans in eight cities. He found that officials refused to reconsider their support for rail, even when presented with figures showing that rail projects would not cover even the operating costs, ignoring capital costs.</P><P>     In our region, planners presented reasonable estimates of ridership and costs. Both estimates showed that the proposal was hugely expensive and would not reduce congestion or automobile-related pollution. Nevertheless, many officials, including Seattle Mayor Norm Rice and King County Executive Gary Locke, publicly supported the RTA proposal. The desire for streetcars left them and others as blind to the transit situation as Blanche DuBois was blind to her emotions in the Tennessee Williams play.</P><P>     There are many alternatives to the RTA's proposal. Present policies allowing parking on city streets and enabling firms to provide &quot;free&quot; parking for their employees make driving less burdensome. These policies could be changed. Drivers could also be charged congestion tolls, collected electronically without time-consuming toll booths, to induce them to acknowledge the social costs of driving.</P><P>     Air-quality programs could do more to reduce automobile pollution by using remote sensing to detect and require cleanup of the dirtiest cars. The dirtiest 10 percent of cars, those responsible for 60 percent of pollution, could be purchased with gas-tax money and removed from the roads.</P><P>     Walking and biking are clean and cheap transit options. Such options can be encouraged by constructing more pedestrian-friendly thoroughfares like the Burke Gilman Trail. Carpools, vanpools, smaller buses and more HOV lanes all make better use of existing roads.</P><P>     The RTA's plan is not a precise analog to WPPSS' poorly considered nuclear dream-cum-nightmare. However, the two projects do share a focus upon massive, capital-intensive, inflexible systems. Both evidence a gross inattention to effectiveness and cost. Both imply Olympic-class hubris.</P><P>     Least-cost planning could have saved Northwest electricity consumers millions of dollars and much embarrassment. Let us not have another fiasco with our roads.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.

Ill-conceived federal price controls and OPEC's last successful petroleum embargo combined to create an emergency. The results were disastrous, the predictable consequence of policies that disrupt the market process and favor special interests  </P><P>      In response to this &quot;crisis,&quot; Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, commonly referred to as PURPA. Designed to spur research into &quot;alternative&quot; energy sources, this law produced several unintended consequences including higher energy prices for the consumer.</P><P>Resource Data International, Inc., a Boulder, Colo., consulting firm, estimates the PURPA will cost consumers up to $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, in direct subsidies and also in &quot;deadweight&quot; losses from overcapacity. The PURPA fiasco provides an expensive lesson in what happens when regulators ignore the market's signals. Efficiency, innovation and conservation become casualties of politics.</P><P>PURPA's creators should have been familiar with the law of unintended consequences, for this legislation was designed to address some of the unforeseen results of the Depression-era Rural Electrification Administration (REA). Despite the merits of rural electrification - and they are numerous and significant - governmental policies imposed unanticipated costs. Specifically, subsidies for capital-intensive, coal- and oil-fired electricity inhibited research into and development of alternative energy sources. Hence, from the mid-1930s until the late 1970s there was a hiatus of research in renewable energy.</P><P>     Many people are surprised to learn that serious interest in renewable energy began in the late 1800s. Before the REA, the high cost of stringing power lines to remote areas made wind, solar and small hydroelectric technologies highly attractive. The profit motive encouraged entrepreneurship. The REA and its subsidies to centrally generated power and rural electrification undermined money-making opportunities, and research into renewable energy evaporated.</P><P>     Something is amiss when the government creates a problem, then 40 years later claims that government action is necessary to correct the problem, yet this is precisely what happened in 1978. Proponents of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act couched their rhetoric in national-security terms. PURPA was to compensate for the absence of research into renewable energy sources.</P><P>     My colleague at Montana State, Richard Stroup, and I were concerned about this back in 1979. Writing about the lack of research and development in renewable energy, we wrote:</P><P>      &quot;Our current retarded position, caused largely by subsidies, has led to arguments that we should not subsidize the development of alternative energy systems. But clearly there is a problem with subsidies. Specifically, a subsidy inhibits developments in areas not subsidized. Since the future is uncertain we cannot know what the cost of our bias will be. We can only know that there will be a cost.&quot;</P><P>      When governments distort market signals, problems follow. Government subsidies of the 1930s caused a sharp decline in research and development of alternative energy sources. Price controls in the 1970s produced long lines at the gas pumps and reduced incentives to find greater energy efficiency.</P><P>The cost of subsidizing renewable energy sources is at least $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, and consumers are the ones who end up paying. In addition to granting direct subsidies for renewable energy, PURPA required public utilities to purchase the power generated by these sources - solar, wind and &quot;waste-to-energy&quot; - at prices far above the market price. Renewable energy now sells for up to 16 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Even in Hawaii and Alaska, where energy prices are among the highest in the country, the Edison Electric Institute estimates that energy costs from all sources range from 7 to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, far below the break-even point for renewable energy.</P><P>     Subsidies and guaranteed prices had the predictable result. We now have power plants that lie idle, built by tax-deferred municipal bonds and then abandoned because the plants can not cover their operating costs. Some operate far below capacity and are in disrepair because, as in pre-1989 Eastern Bloc energy production, the revenues from the additional capacity would not cover the repairs.</P><P>     One of the sorriest examples is the Altamont Pass windfarm just east of San Francisco. Not only does its electricity cost 11 cents a kilowatt hour to produce but the unsightly windmills kill birds; in the past two years some 500 raptors - including 78 golden eagles - have been sucked into the blades. PURPA even gave rise to the world's only commercial-scale manure-fired power plant. Power from this plant cost eight times the market price to produce, and the plant operators had trouble keeping the fuel lit. Recent floods finally accomplished what the market was prevented from doing and shut down the plant.</P><P>     No firm fully accountable for its costs would persist with such schemes. REA, PURPA, and energy price controls force us to pay twice for errors in political judgment. First, as taxpayers, since our taxes fund these subsidies, and second, as ratepayers, since utilities pass high-priced energy costs on to the consumer. Altamont Pass and the manure-fired power plant in El Centro, Calif., are illustrative examples of an important truth: Government efforts to direct innovation and promote particular outcomes have unintended and often pernicious consequences.</P><P>     Free markets and free prices help entrepreneurs and investors sift through the cow manure. We should remember the lessons of history as we consider how to promote conservation and efficiency in our energy future. </P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

I end my career with the course I began 25 years ago at Indiana University, The Political Economy of Environmental Policy. Throughout my career, I have advocated environmental policies based on incentives, not commands  </P><P>      I helped create an environmental paradigm that views economies as ecosystems. Both adapt to changing conditions and widely dispersed information. Both involve complex webs of individuals linked into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. My approach is an alternative to the traditional green model, which assumes that if we only love nature enough, select good managers, and give them enough authority, we can protect our environment. The traditional model is fatally flawed. When people set out to govern by love, they end by ruling through force and fear.</P><P>     While environmental values are important guides for behavior, I stress the importance of information, incentives and institutional design. These are the pillars of a new field of political economy, the New Resource Economics (NRE).</P><P>     The NRE approach emphasizes property rights, market incentives and the constructive potential of voluntary cooperation. These concepts help us understand how economic progress can be harmonized with liberty and environmental quality. The NRE's strong ethical and philosophical foundations build on the classical liberal ideals of America's founders, especially Jefferson and Madison.</P><P>     The NRE draws heavily on the analytic leverage of microeconomic theory leavened with Austrian economics, public-choice economics, and property-rights theory. Taken together, these schools of thought yield several general principles for environmental management:</P><P>       1. Liberty and individual responsibility are fundamental to a constructive and harmonious social order. Social order fosters prosperity, and since demand for environmental quality increases with wealth, environmentalists have a stake in promoting prosperity.</P><P>     2. There is no one perfect system for economic and social coordination. Markets, governments and private nonprofit organizations each have predictable benefits and flaws. When advocating specific environmental reforms, we should consider each of these systems, focusing upon the information and incentives each produces.</P><P>     3. Economies are like ecosystems. The most basic law of each states that everything is interrelated: It is impossible to do just one thing. In economies as in ecosystems, human actions have effects beyond those intended.</P><P>     4. Individuals are self-interested. When evaluating a decision, they first ask: &quot;How will this decision affect me and the things I value?&quot; The welfare of others, especially relatives and friends, is normally considered, but self-interest influences perceptions of problems, alternatives, and solutions.</P><P>     5. Incentives influence decisions. Individuals weigh the relative costs and benefits of competing alternatives. As the costs to the decision-maker of choosing a particular option increase, that option becomes less attractive.</P><P>     6. Decision-makers generally conserve only the resources over which they have control and for which they face responsibility. When the decision-maker is insulated from the costs of his/her actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems usually follow. For example, when pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced, and when regulations are free to the regulator, they too are overproduced.</P><P>     7. Information is costly in terms of time, effort and money. Individuals stop acquiring additional information when its expected value is less than the burden of acquisition. Hence, voters are relatively ill-informed about most policy issues. To the individual, both the costs of ignorance and benefits of knowledge are lower in public than in private decisions.</P><P>     8. Legal and economic institutions differ greatly in the quality of information and type of incentives they generate. When institutions hold individuals accountable for their actions, economic progress and environmental quality are complements, not competitors.</P><P>     9. Increases in efficiency give us greater value from equal or fewer resources. Otherwise, nothing of value is free. For example, to have wilderness areas we give up the opportunity for development. Although I often find this &quot;trade-off&quot; worthwhile, it is intellectually irresponsible to deny that opportunities are forgone when we declare a parcel of land to be wilderness.</P><P>     10. Scarce goods must be rationed and the rationing system we select affects the amount there is to ration. This is why institutional design is so important. Political allocation exacerbates scarcity while eroding ethics. Markets economize on love and goodwill while fostering efficiency.</P><P>      As Aldo Leopold explained in &quot;The Land Ethic,&quot; environmental values are important. But values and good intentions will not suffice. When considering reform, focus on the information and incentives generated by the proposed institutions. In the policy arena, an understanding of political economy is indispensable in achieving our environmental goals.</P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

<TITLE>New West Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>9/27/95</P><H1>A new coherence emerging in the West</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P><P>At each summer's end, I leave our Montana ranch and return to Washington.  I love to drive the West.  </P><P>This is a good time to reconsider our culture, ecology, economy and politics.  Increasingly, I'm having second thoughts about these subjects.  Many friends, academics, business people and environmentalists, are also re-evaluating their approach to environmental goals.  </P><P>Our culture, economy, and politics were based upon the exploitation of natural resources.  This gave the West coherence.   The default position was to dam rivers, graze grass, cut timber, butcher buffalo.  Even our great National Parks were promoted by railroads for their potential tourist revenue.  </P><P>Some people were rapacious and opportunistic; a blessed few were prudent stewards.  But the dominant politics and economics were insensitive to noncommercial or spiritual aspects of our environment.  In the past generation, a majority of people have became environmentalists.  The West changed.  </P><P>It's time for another.  A new environmental paradigm is emerging and perhaps with it, a new coherence for the West.  </P><P>This approach accepts the significance of noncommercial and spiritual values.  It also recognizes the critical importance of information and incentives.  Good intentions and education will not suffice.  Big bureaucracies will stray from their mission.  Political force will lead to plunder.  And takings, even for good ecological cause, are perverse.  It is irresponsible to pretend these problems away.</P><P> Economic logic has powerful analytic tools but they alone are not enough.  Even though I came to economics from anthropology, and should have known better, I slighted community while focused on efficiency.  (Sometimes it takes years to de-program the lessons of graduate school.)  </P><P>Driving down the Blackfoot Drainage toward the Columbia, I realized that no one has ever gone to the wall for efficiency.  And only the naive would even think of mobilizing citizens under its banner.  The variables that economists can best measure are not those which matter most.  But this is not to recommend some New Age eco-romanticism.  We must consider ecological science, political economy and culture if we are to design successful reform.  In isolation, none will do the job.</P><P>Modern societies can be destructive and corrupting but they provide the means for sensitive and constructive action.  Our task is to foster their humane potential and make them ecologically sustainable.  Science and prosperity are our best allies in this effort.  A return to the folkways and mores of the Native Americans, even were it possible, gives no answer.  Here's a second thought for romantics to consider.</P><P>Early man was not the far-sighted ecological steward of myth.  The ideal of sustainable harvests were as foreign as IRAs.  </P><P>Charles Kay is a wildlife research ecologist at Utah State University.  For 20 years he has examined the archeological record of Greater Yellowstone.  He and other researchers have noted that with the arrival of Homo sapiens on on the North American continent, many species of large herbivores went extinct.  </P><P>There is an emerging theory of &quot;aboriginal overkill.&quot;  Humans were effective predators.  Can any other animal run a mile, swim a river, climb a tree and organize a pack to hunt?  Add fire as a tool and a real killer emerges.  Kay writes:</P><I><P>[Aboriginal peoples] . . . acted in ways that maximized their individual fitness regardless of the impact on the environment.  By limiting ungulate numbers and purposefully modifying the vegetation with fire, Native Americans structured entire plant and animal communities of western North America.</P</I>><P>The Plains Indians were smart, tough and remarkably skillful.  When they received the horse, steel knife and finally the gun, it became much easier and safer to kill bison.  These new tools gave the Indians a huge discount on buffalo.   At the lower price, they rationally bought more.     This behavior is an efficient adjustment by individual tribes to changing &quot;prices&quot; of bison.  The buffalo were fugitive resources, they really did roam. This movement, coupled with tribal competition for them, made it impossible for the Indians to manage the buffalo as a renewable resource. Slaughter by whites greatly compounded the problem.  </P><P>Early white explorers noted that large ungulates were extremely rare when Whites came to the Rocky Mountain region.  Kay writes, &quot;Between 1835 and 1876, twenty different parties spent a total of 765 days traveling through the Yellowstone ecosystem . . .[T]heir first-person journals contain 45 references to a lack of game or a shortage of food.&quot;  Lewis and Clark nearly starved and were reduced to eating dogs when traversing this region.  Today, the area is over run, over grazed and over browsed - by game.  </P><P>Several Native Americans tribes managed beaver streams and salmon fishing sites with clear and transferable property rights.  However, the Plains Indians' could not control access.  They had no property rights to constrain other hunters.   </P><P>Today many environmentalists are reconsidering means to their ecological ends.  Sustainability does not arrive through ideology.  They can't count on government management for bureaucracies generate pathologies.  And unless constrained, firms will neglect or abuse environmental values.  </P><P>There is no single answer to our goals.  It is time for second thoughts.  I will share some in this series of columns. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P> Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973 to protect species threatened or in danger of extinction.  Federal judges have an especially difficult time dealing with it.  In the ESA, they confront nasty conflicts between Congressional intent to save endangered species and our Bill of Rights.  </P><P><CITE>In Saving All the Pieces</CITE>, Rocky Barker notes that federal mandates generally require agencies to provide protection 'when practicable'.  But the ESA is different.  Protection of all species is absolute.  There is no room for equivocation; no provision for tradeoffs among competing legitimate and important values.  An endangered species trumps all other values.  </P><P>The Fifth Amendment to our Constitution concludes with, &quot;...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;  It's not in the Bill of Rights by accident.  It was intended to preclude plundering by politicians and bureaucrats, what ever their justification.  Americans' experience with the ESA demonstrates why the Founders were so concerned with uncompensated takings.  </P><P>The application of the ESA demonstrates the mischief and unintended consequences which follow when we attempt to take value from individuals without &quot;just compensation&quot;.  When endangered species are found on private land,  the owners lose opportunities to undertake legitimate actions.  Land value is often reduced, sometimes eliminated.  Consequences are bound to follow.  Many of them harm habitat of endangered species.</P><P>Many well intentioned environmental activists discount, ignore or pretend these losses away.  This seems intellectually and ethically irresponsible.  But what if ecological integrity trumps both the ethics of the case and the value of logical consistency?  Honorable people could hold this position.  </P><P>The ecological goals which motivated the Act's creation maintain wide support.  It's the commando approach, seize control of the land, which causes problems for species and people.  Let's consider the environmental consequences of takings by the ESA's administrators.  We will keep two ecological guidelines in mind; we can never do only one thing, and everything is tied to everything else.  These principles are as valid in political economy as in ecology.</P><P>The Act commonly transforms harmless and inherently cute critters including the Spotted Owl and Red-cockaded woodpecker, into enemies of the landowner.  Animals such as the gray wolf and grizzly bear, creatures which can pose genuine threats to people or property, carry a double burden.  If we care to protect them (and I do), and if we were to name one group of individuals whom we should want to like an endangered species, it surely would be its host, the land owner.  Why make them foes of ESA's goals?</P><P>The Act grants unprecedented powers to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, some even greater than powers of the Department of Defense in wartime. The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights states that: &quot;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law&quot;.  Various creatures, some quite unappealing to most people, have greater rights.  The government must pay for what it takes when supplying our military.  This is why it is so difficult to close down a base.  In contrast, the land owner suffers if The Fish and Wildlife Service finds a listed species on her land. </P><P>The exercise of these powers under the ESA has perverse but predictable consequences.  The land owner has few incentives to protect habitat for the species and strong incentives to modify it preemptively to make it less attractive.  Alternatively, he may simply &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up&quot;.  The Act encourages land owners to break the spirit and the letter of the law.  This is not a sustainable policy for protecting endangered species.  And it's not achieving its goals.  </P><P>This is why an increasing number of environmental advocates believe it's time to rethink the Act.  The ESA is one troublesome example of keeping our Progressive Era's &quot;scientific management&quot; approach in place long after it was found wanting.  Many distinguished analysts are having second thoughts about the ESA and the entire scientific management, command-and-control approach which it represents.  </P><P>Professor Robert Nelson teaches Public Policy at the University of Maryland after spending two decades as a senior researcher in the Department of Interior, the home agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  He predicts that over the next twenty or thirty years new approaches will replace the failed system.  Nelson believes the current period has many similarities with the Progressive Era.  In his words, &quot;A new set of ideas and a new institutional framework are required, just as the progressives saw such a need one hundred years ago.&quot;  </P><P>A century ago American Progressives saw serious problems in America.  Many of these came from the ability of business to neglect a public interest in favor of narrow self interest.  Businesses could ignore costs imposed on others.  The Progresives' solution was to impose regulation and management by wise and competent bureaucrats.  </P><P>Today, the ESA follows this model to its logical but counterproductive conclusion.  It clearly is time for serious second thoughts about better ways to protect endangered species.  Reform requires that we acknowledge the importance of secure property rights and regulatory stability.  As the Founding Fathers understood, it's too expensive to permit government to take things for free.  </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P>     Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Reform that generates poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P><P>     Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could operate even if their activities harmed the habitat of endangered species.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P><P>     While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences.  It tried to force landowners to maintain habitat.  This made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  It pits socially valuable activities such as forestry and farming against habitat protection.  </P><P>     The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species.  They can ignore the lost opportunities imposed.  Social or landowner costs don't enter their calculations.  The administrators have no incentive to economize when protecting habitat.   </P><P>     This command-and-control approach pits landowners against endangered species.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P><P>     We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P><P>     They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P><P>     In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pays taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P><P>     Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevent them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P><P>     The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.   The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P><P>     Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P><P>     &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P><P>     Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P><P>     Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P><P>     Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. agreed and found dens for wolves.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P><P>     With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species.</P><P>___________________<BR>John A.

Baden</P><P>     Each fall my thoughts return to a boyhood of hunting.  Opening day trumped Thanksgiving and even rivaled Christmas.  Our rituals and gear provided anthropological fodder.     </P><P>      In fifth grade I created the Concord Conservation Club.  Like most rural people of my generation (I'm in my mid-50s), the green path ran through Field and Stream, the leading outdoors magazine.  I still see sportsmen as great preservers of habitat.  But with few Americans with rural roots, the links between hunting and environmentalism grow tenuous.  </P><P>     There's a growing tension, indeed an antipathy, between younger environmentalists (often vegetarians) and their elders who came to ecology through the &quot;blood sports&quot;.  Today's mainstream environmental magazines commonly ignore or denigrate hunting and hunters.</P><P>     The millions of hunters in America, however, play a powerful, direct and active role in environmental protection.  Ducks Unlimited protects over 20 million acres of wetland.  On their 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch, the venerable Boone &amp; Crockett Club conducts research to harmonize agriculture with wildlife while providing habitat for elk, mule deer, grizzly bears, cougars, eagles and cutthroat trout.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Pheasants Forever and the Ruffed Grouse Society also protect wildlife habitat by purchasing land and development rights.  Hunters have a huge stake in preserving the wildlife they sometimes hunt. </P><P>     Yet America's hunters are maligned or ostracized.  Here's a story from my last trip East:</P><P>     5:00am Saturday was dark, rainy, cold and windy.  Volvo wagons were sleeping in their driveways when a man came out of his garage with two golf bags which he leaned against a GMC Suburban.  He walked back to the kitchen and emerged with a thermos and an excited yellow lab.  The dog jumped into the Suburban, and the man lifted a golf bag behind the driver's seat.  He turned toward the lights of a tow truck pulling into his drive.  The man from AAA got out.</P><P>     &quot;Have you heard a crash?  A car hit a deer near here.  We just got the call.  Driver's all shook up and didn't give good directions.  Totaled the front end and busted the windshield.  Lucky he didn't get a deer in the face.  I gotta drag the car in; third one this week.  It gits worse every fall...</P><P>     &quot;You didn't hear anything?  No wonder with the wind and rain.  You must be nuts to play golf in this stuff...</P><P>     &quot;You're what?  Hunting ducks with golf clubs?  You must be damn good with a driver or you really are crazy...</P><P>     &quot;You've got what?  A 12 gauge and decoys in your golf bags?  Are you sure you're OK?  Did YOU hit the deer and bump your head?</P><P>     &quot;Oh, you hide the gear in golf bags!  Your neighbors would get real upset if they knew you were a hunter...</P><P>     &quot;Or even if they knew you kept guns around?  Their kids couldn't play with yours?  You must be nuts to live here.&quot;</P><P>The deer in the story, like so many animals, has lost its natural predators.  In many areas cars, not carnivores, kill deer.</P><P>     Organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Fund For Animals (FFA) assert that wildlife populations lacking predators will achieve a &quot;natural balance&quot; without degrading their environment.  But sound science and commonplace observations reveal how truncated food chains degrade ecosystems.  To protect ecosystems, we must acknowledge missing links and respond responsibly.  This is a place for tough love.  </P><P>     Hunters can promote healthy game and non-game animals.  The Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge in north Virginia, for example, safeguards endangered bald eagles.  But during the 1980s the deer population exploded and exceeded the refuge's carrying capacity by tenfold.  Without predators checking deer population, the entire Mason Neck ecosystem was distorted to the eagle's peril.  Starving deer consumed entire generations of young trees -- essentially destroying future bald eagle roosts.  And the deer weren't faring so well either.  Only disease and starvation regulated their population.  </P><P>     Despite the fervent protests and litigation of the Humane Society of America, Mason Neck managers instituted a deer hunting season in 1989.  The results are in.  Contrary to predictions of human carnage, no hunting accidents have occurred.  The deer population, although still too high, is now a fifth of its 1989 size.  The deer are healthier, exhibiting increased body weight and antler mass.  Lastly, trees and eagles' imperiled ecosystems are recovering.</P><P>     The new generation of environmentalists often finds hunting distasteful.  Vegans rarely join Ducks Unlimited.  And some activists invest millions in litigation against hunters and now fishermen.  But most have the maturity to understand how this counters habitat protection and healthy wildlife populations.  </P><P>     Hunters affect the natural balance and generate the political will which helps conserve habitat.  Members of PETA and FFA have weaker incentives to protect habitat -- so they don't.  In contrast, Ducks Unlimited bought protection for over 17 million acres of nesting grounds in Canada, 2 million acres of winter grounds in Mexico, and nearly a million acres of wetlands in the U.S.  If anti-hunting groups bought &quot;hunting-free&quot; refuges, they could introduce predators or learn that sparing Bambi can spoil entire ecosystems.  </P><P>     When considering this positive possibility, I suggest we place our hopes and expectations in separate baskets.  Anthropologists and economists can explain why hunters are important friends of habitat.  While anti-hunting activists may resist the ecological benefits of hunting, they will eventually learn that nature bats last.  And the clean-up process is seldom pretty.</P><P>_________________________________________<BR> John A.

Baden</P><P>    	Markets economize on love, that most precious of values.  They encourage cooperation and civility among disparate people.  This was one of the great lessons of Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who was founding editor of <CITE>The Journal of Conflict Resolution</CITE>.  Boulding developed the concept of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; with the understanding that we're all in this together. </P><P>   	We should cherish social arrangements which foster harmony and inhibit conflict without requiring that people love one another.  The ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, terrorism in the Mid-East, and discord in Canada are powerful reminders of perennial conflict among groups with differing values and goals.</P><P>    	While markets favor efficiency and profits, they also encourage diverse people to interact harmoniously.  They promote civil, coordinated, and constructive social order.  Here's a homey example.</P><P>    	Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, has several supermarkets.  Each offers valuable lessons.  Although I shop them all, I know best the Albertson's by my office.  It has tens of thousands of different items.  There is evolutionary competition among stores, among brands within each store, and among products within individual brands.  And between Albertson's and Safeway is the Community Food Co-op which offers an alternative blend of exotics and local, organic products.</P><P>    	These stores compete with differing mixes of service, economy, and products.  Even the check-out lines vary in lengths and degree of service.  Each grocer behaves as though he cares while seeking consumers with varying income, interests, and values.  </P><P>    	Consumer preferences are continuously monitored at the check-out line.  As clerks scan the products, consumer preferences are entered into the store's computer which adjusts inventory and orders.  With their purchases consumers elect the stores and product lines they find most attractive. </P><P>    	Among stores and within stores, winners are determined by voluntary transactions.  The losers gradually lose shelf space.  Ultimately they either improve their products' appeal or disappear.  The consumer really is sovereign.  The market registers consumer preference and automatically adjusts to harmoniously reconcile changing demands with new supplies.</P><P>    	This process is quite remarkable.  It demonstrates that, at root, the market is a social arrangement which efficiently generates information about people's wants and reservations while providing incentives to heed disparate, oft conflicting preferences.</P><P>    	Free and open markets offer a setting where each can satisfy his or her wants without imposing their preferences on others.  The market process promotes diversity, freedom of choice, and innovations -- blessings in this imperfect world.  Yet, there is another huge advantage we normally take for granted. </P><P>    	Though market efficiency is marvelous, the harmony fostered by voluntary exchange seems an even greater value, especially as inter-group conflict becomes so significant. </P><P>    	Market exchange by competent individuals, permits people with radically differing views to peacefully coexist.  Like most college towns, Bozeman has many committed vegetarians.  They shop peacefully and amicably with rancher and logger carnitarians, people who eat vegetables only as occasional concessions to health. </P><P>    	Ranchers mingle with Dallas blondes with big hair and Big Sky condos.  Counterculture refugees of the 1960s mix with fun hogs who bounce among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain trails. Vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists, teetotaling Mormons, and New Age vegans freely intermingle at Albertson's, Safeway, and the Community Co-op.  These markets accomodate the teetotalers', and those for whom dinner implies good wine.  When transactions are voluntary, interactions are peaceful.</P><P>    	Clear private property rights and free exchange foster civility and cooperation.  Coercion doesn't occur with these institutions.  Committed vegetarians and prohibitionists cooperated with those holding antithetical views. </P><P>    	What if grocery store management was political?  Fighting would erupt between vegetarians and carnitarians; teetotalers and Epicureans; organic fanatics who protest pesticides and farmers who use chemicals; populists opposed to corporate agriculture and shareholders in those firms; working parents who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be closed on Saturday or Sunday.  Vegans might demonstrate in front while ranchers lobby managers in back.  Supervisors would set prices according to interest group power.  We then might see bread quotas, veal purchasing regulations, subsidies for union-labeled wine, and shortages common.  Political power would trump consumer preferences, just like it does with public forest management today.</P><P>    	Since wealth and political power go together, the poor are usually advantaged when we move decisions from the political arena to the marketplace.  They are usually disadvantaged when we decide politically.  </P><P>    	Montana State University Professor Ramona Marotz-Baden summarizes, &quot;Fortunately, we have pretty much kept these decisions out of the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the force of the state.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the result we have learned to expect.&quot; </P><P>    	No single set of institutions is perfect.  There's an appropriate role for government, for public non-profit organizations (huge ones like The Boy Scouts and Nature Conservancy, or small ones like FREE and the Gallatin Institute), and for the marketplace.  In general, there are strong ethical and material reasons to shift decisions away from government.  Harmonious diversity is one of the best. </P><P>_______________ <BR>John A.

<P>     	Ocean fisheries exemplify &quot;common-pool resources&quot;.  It's difficult, if not impossible, to fence in or brand marine fish.  Their freedom is bound by the forces of nature.</P>

<P>     	These fish are fugitive resources.  Their migration ignores political, social, and legal boundaries.  This often leads to great tragedy.  Fisheries demonstrate the classic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;.  They are increasingly imperiled by fishermen engaging in traditional and honorable activities: bringing high quality food from the sea to people.  </P>

<P>     	Two problems plague both society and fish.  The first problem is that increasing world demand and technological capabilities exceed the reproductive capacity of many ecosystems.  The pre-1970s illusion of infinite abundance is gone.  </P>

<P>     	Second, and most important, fisheries lack a sustainable system of rationing the valuable, but increasingly scarce, resources.  Today, the world's fisheries are predominantly open-access.  It's first come first serve, almost devoid of rules fostering responsible behavior.  </P>

<P>     	Open-access subjects fisheries to the profound pathologies of the commons.  Fisheries suffer from overexploitation and declining profitability because fishermen behave predictably when access to a valuable resource is open to all.  In such circumstances individually and socially rational behavior diverges. Self-restraint and conservation is trumped by incentives that encourage overfishing.  Individual fishermen reel in short-term profits from overfishing while society as a whole bears the costs of economic and environmental waste.  </P>

<P>     	Fisheries commons result in ecological and economic tragedy.  Fishermen aren't dumb; they want to stop fishing once they optimize the yield of the fishery -- but if they act responsibly, they watch others continue fishing.  More and more fishermen and boats will arrive until profits disappear altogether.  As fish become harder to find, profits vanish and the long-term health of the fishery deteriorates.</P>

<P>        	Overfishing is exacerbated by another pathology: overcapitalization.   The race to reel in more and more fish encourages fishing capacity far in excess of the fishery's reproductivecarrying capacity.  Economic distortions couple environmental degradation with overinvestment in fishing capacity.  Unbridled competition produces bigger vessels, better sonar, and larger nets.  Taxpayers subsidize newer boats and better nets.  This only aggravates the situation as national politics fights marine international ecosystems.</P>

<P>     	This process spawns other pathologies.  Bycatch, the incidental landings of unsellable species, wastes enormous quantities of fish every year (Discards in shrimp fisheries can outweigh shrimp landings eight to one.).  Many fishermen practice high-grading, throwing out less valuable fish.  Fishermen lack incentives to conserve the discarded fish, because they do not bear the costs of waste.  </P>

<P>     	Regulating restraint through quotas on catch levels, minimum mesh sizes, and shortened seasons, often worsens matters.  Fishermen lobby for overinflated quotas and more subisidies for boats capable of grabbing a bigger slice of the pie.  More overcapitalization brings satellites, surveillance planes, and the latest in technology to bear in a mad scramble for fish.  Cutthroat competition in derby-style seasons presses captains to employ dangerous tactics in already hazardous fishing conditions.  </P>

<P>    	When fish cross boundaries, pathologies multiply. There is no guarantee that fish leaving one nation's waters will ever return, so the impetus is to catch as much as possible before the fish migrate.  Fishermen play one area off against the other.  The jurisdiction with the weakest regulations becomes the most popular -- and the anarchic &quot;high seas&quot; beats them all.  Some fishermen fill their quota at home, then travel to foreign waters and fish again.</P>

<P>     	There is a fisheries crisis indeed.  The pathologies involve ecology, ethics, economics, and politics.  Dozens of fisheries are depleted, many have collapsed.  Subsidies, price supports, dislocated fishermen, and sportsfishing restictions all take their toll.  The fisheries crisis caused nearly thirty international conflicts in 1994 alone.  </P>

<P>     	Avoiding the problems and preventing the tragedy of the commons requires institutional reform.  Currently, institutions usually reward fishermen for lobbying to increase subsidies and quotas, for increasing fleet capacity, for entering a fishery, and for maximizing landings in the short term.  </P>

<P>     	But there is reason for cautious hope.  The astronomical costs of maintaining fisheries commons present political entrepreneurs opportunities to innovate.  Market forces and property rights have proven effective tools for sensitive and sensible resource management.  Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), as a sort of private-property fishing rights, are finding success in New Zealand and some Alaskan fisheries.  </P>

<P>     	Economists can explain how fishermen, under better conditions, could restrain their efforts to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of fishing over the long run.  A fisherman guaranteed sole and indefinite proprietorship of an ocean resource is unlikely to squander it by overfishing.  Like responsible farmers and foresters, profit-maximizers would conserve and optimize resources -- not harvest like there is no tomorrow.  Sustainability is key, because, for them, there is a tomorrow.</P>

<P>     	Individuals and society will benefit by overcoming the political costs of reform.  Fishermen have become addicted to government subsidies for survival in overcapitalized, overexploited fisheries.  Up to now, policy-makers have lacked the political will to restrain &quot;rugged individualist&quot; fishermen.  Increasing scarcity and environmental degradation are making privatization with monitored and enforceable rules ever more attractive. </P>
 
<P>    Leaders in the fishing industry understands that pathologies of the commons are leading to disaster.  Without secure rights granted to communities or individuals, the beleaguered fisheries will drown in a tragic tide. The task is to develop institutional arrangements that harmonize ecological realities with laws of human behavior.  </P>

<P>If you aren't a good boy, you'll find a lump of coal in your stocking Christmas morning.   This is an unhappy prospect for most American children.  However, we can imagine situations in which a large lump of coal would be a blessing, for example in a city under siege.  Coal would be a wonderful gift for people in Sarajevo lacking fuel for cooking and heating.  The value of a gift depends upon the circumstances of the recipient.  </P>

<P> In the spirit of giving coal to those whose lives it would improve, I propose reform of liabilities and standards on urban Superfund sites called brownfields.  Yes, we can help poor people by relaxing some environmental regulations,  those with perverse consequences.  Superfund is a liability time bomb that strikes fear into the hearts of entrepreneurial developers.  It triggers a slew of environmental and social woes.</P>

<P>	 Like the best solutions to many environmental problems, this gift seems counter-intuitive.  Relaxing the environmental protection standards on brownfields would help clean up our inner cities and improve opportunities.  Brownfields are lands abandoned because of alleged contamination.  They do more than just blemish urban landscapes.  They create multiple problems for inner cities, suburbs, and rural areas.</P>

<P>	 Many brownfields persist due to Superfund's poorly considered regulations and exorbitant litigation costs.  Further, they suffer from laws which make illegal today actions which were legal, proper and productive when undertaken.  These retroactive joint and several liability arrangements are windfalls for lawyers and bureaucrats but they too often harm our most disadvantaged citizens.  </P>

<P> People once believed that such strict regulation and liability were advantageous.  They didn't understand how market incentives encourage cleanup of hazardous sites.   Thanks to scholars such as Don Coursey at the University of Chicago, we now have better understanding of how bureaucracies and markets operate to deal with these problems.  </P>

<P> The derelict lands have been condemned by the EPA due to a mix of real and imagined health risks and bureaucratic errors of classification.  As a result, these lands are taboo for would-be developers.  Urban areas are stuck with empty brownfields. These lands could be used for parks, factories, and housing.  Seattle's Gasworks Park is a stellar example of a blighted site becoming an amenity.  </P>

<P> Superfund shunts industrial development from the urban brownfields to  the &quot;greenfields&quot; of the suburbs and rural periphery.  Farmland and forests are invaded by industry which could move into brownfield sites.  Were it not for the extreme and oft silly operation of Superfund, many of these new developments would be in urban areas.</P>

<P> The invasion of greenfields causes a host of other problems.  Duplicating the necessary infrastructure is expensive.  Economic growth in the suburbs increases urban sprawl and exacerbates traffic problems.  Unemployment in inner cities remains high.  </P>

<P> Worst of all, the brownfield sites remain contaminated.  No one has incentives to clean up the mess.  And nobody converts it into valuable real estate.  It's a lose-lose situation.</P>

<P>	 But there is hope for reform.  Michigan began an effort to turn brownfields and other Superfund sites into attractive real estate for developers.  With covenants-not-to-sue and other legal protections, firms may develop sites without fearing liability for earlier pollution by others. </P>

<P> States have incentives to reform Superfund.  Practical politicians and regulators, and even the EPA itself, realize that we don't need industrial plants with dirt clean enough for kids to eat.  Justice Steve Breyer's Harvard University Press book, Breaking the Vicious Circle,  adds force to this argument.</P>

<P>	 Businesses see potentially profitable ventures in once-idle brownfields.  Local residents benefit as the neighborhood rebounds.  With EPA's co-operation, over 450 properties have begun redevelopment under Michigan's initiative.</P>

<P>	 Business leaders and local authorities band together to remove disincentives to develop brownfields.  Few environmental groups object for they are aware of Cleveland's 167 brownfields, Chicago's 2,000, and 450,000 more across America.  They see how they hurt our inner cities.  Rural environmentalists support reform for they see urban sprawl encroaching on the greenfield buffer zones surrounding metropolitan pollution.</P>

<P>	 Thus far, 27 states have introduced legislation empowering developers to take advantage of brownfields.  By granting assurances that developers wouldn't be held liable for existing contamination, developers are converting the brownfields into productive sites.  Entrepreneurship joins environmentalism.</P>

<P>	 The possibilities for cleaning up brownfields are immense.  Relaxing some standards and removing retroactive liability rules will free entrepreneurs to clean and develop contaminated sites in inner cities.  While they improve blighted inner-city landscapes, the peripheral greenfields will also benefit. </P>

<P>	 All of this can be attained with a simple gift: change the regulations and liabilities for brownfields.  It would cost little.  Inner-city and countryside environments could benefit greatly.  And reform would be a gift that keeps on giving.</P>

<H1>A Green Campaign Speech for a Better Environment</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
Some day, a politician will offer reforms harmonizing environmental quality with responsible liberty and modest prosperity. This niche in our political ecology is vacant. Incentives to fill it have been weak.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is rapidly changing. Republican representative Sherwood Boehlert of NY said, "There were some valuable lessons learned by some who ignored environmental policy at their own peril." Celinda Lake, a Democrat pollster, explained in the past election, "the environment played a very important role". The incumbents who were defeated came from suburban and upscale districts. She notes: "The environment played a very heavy role in those districts."
</P>
<P>
But the candidates haven't yet caught up to the electorate. Democrats prefer "Nanny State" solutions to community conservation. Al Gore's learning curve for effective, efficient, and equitable environmental policy seems as flat as a pre-Galileo Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, despite their 1994 "revolution", favor the exploiters and extractors. Dole was linked to ethanol-subsidy addict Archer Daniels Midland. Congress members including Helen Chenoweth and Tom DeLay bulldozed their favored corporate interests over environmental values. And Jack Kemp couldn't even pronounce the E.P.A.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are beholden to entrenched special interests. It seems elephants can't forget to plunder, and asses can't learn new ways.
</P>
<P>
Ross Perot's Reform Party doesn't even mention the environment. The upstart "Green Party" even with Ralph Nader, America's most famous professional agitator, won only 2.4% of California's vote. And <A HREF="http://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</A> candidate Harry Browne did great on Internet polls, with a landslide in Cyber-America. But, like Perot, Browne's platform ignored environmental topics.
</P>
<P>
Here is a green campaign speech, available to all candidates. It's provided to candidates from all parties. Longer versions are available in FREE's "Green Blueprint for America," and a shorter version is found in "The Candidate's Guide to Environmental Issues" by Joe Bast of the <A HREF="http://www.heartland.org/">Heartland Institute</A>.

	<TD><P>
"I believe in protecting the environment. I believe in conservation and preservation, in parks and wilderness, in using, enjoying, and stewarding our natural environment. We all have a duty to make this world a safer and cleaner place.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our progress in improving the environment. Since the first Earth Day, air is cleaner, water is cleaner, and many animals are rebounding. Lead emissions have virtually disappeared and water quality, especially in the Great Lakes, has greatly improved. The bald eagle and peregrine falcon have made dramatic recoveries.
</P>

<P>
"We can do better still. Problems of disappearing habitat, ineffective regulations, and new pollution require innovative policy tools. The easy solutions have already been implemented. Next, we must address insensitive and inefficient public lands management, unnecessarily high regulatory costs, and unintended consequences of environemental mandates. We need a new environmentalism for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"My environmental vision sees a safer and cleaner world. Its foundation is sound science rather than hysteria. Citizens are demanding policies that deliver the biggest "bang for the buck." Policies that fail to respect people's liberty and property will fail. We must, however, recognize that, at times, rights conflict. Is my clean air worth your job? My cheap power, your salmon? We can't avoid such trade-offs. Here are seven principles that will help us wisely and fairly achieve a better environment.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
"<B>1. Demand sound science:</B><DD> Too often, crisis entrepreneurs create hysteria in order to drive their policies and increase their own budgets. Peer-reviewed science is critical to reform.
<DT>
"<B>2. Prioritize risks:</B> <DD>Our resources are limited, so we must get the most for our money. Cost-benefits analysis can help prioritize risk and first address the greatest risk to our health and to our environment. We want the most environmental benefit for the least cost.
<DT>"<B>3. Decentralize decision-making:</B> <DD>Command-and-control, one-size-fits-all, centralized planning falsely assumes that all communities are identical. This approach stifles creativity and wastes scarce resources. Distant bureaucrats can't manage local environments with sensitivity or efficiency. Letting locals make decisions encourages innovation, learning, and responsibility. But locals must recognize regional and national interests.
<DT>"<B>4. Carefully privatize some public assets:</B> <DD>Commodities should be produced by private interests who anticipate and respond to market signals. Amenitites should be preserved and made available by public trusts. The federal government should monitor and conduct research, not manage and redistribute to the well-organized. Bureaucracies tend to foster waste, corruption, and short-term political calculus.
<DT>"<B>5. Respect property rights:</B> <DD>The Constitution requires due compensation when government takes or restricts private owners' property. When government is used as an engine of plunder, the plundered usually react. Unjust environmental policies build enemies of those whose cooperation is vital, like farmers, ranchers, and forest owners.
<DT>"<B>6. Hold polluters accountable:</B> <DD>Courts can and should hold polluters responsible for the damage they cause. Let them scramble to find appropriate technology.
<DT>"<B>7. Promote prosperity:</B> <DD>Demand for environmental quality is like that for BMWs, foreign travel, and gourmet food; it increases with education and income.
</DL></P>
<P>"The American public is committed to environmental quality. We've made much progress in that direction. To do more, we need to promote prosperity, secure property rights, and responsible freedom. These are values worthy of America's heritage and a bridge to a greener future. Thank you for your vote next Tuesday."

<H1>Environmentalism Needs A Free Press</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The First Amendment of the Constitution safeguards that most essential feature of democracy: the liberty to communicate ideas and advocate alternatives to the status quo.  It protects freedom of the press, speech, assembly, and religion.  It guarantees our right to complain to and about the government.  
</P>
<P>
Environmental advocates use these freedoms to champion reform.  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace </A> has taken the right to assemble to an artform in their protests and demonstrations.  The litigious <A HREF="http://www.nrdc.org/nrdc">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund flourish with lawsuits against lethargic or misguided government agencies.  The paganism of <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/orgs/ef/">Earth First!</A> depends on freedom of religious expression.  Vibrant environmentalism requires free press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
But environmental advocacy prompts censorship by government agencies and private interests.  On the "left coast" this fall, two Eugene <CITE>Register-Guard</CITE> employees were arrested and their notebook, comeras, and film confiscated after the <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</A> closed the Warner Creek salvage timber sale site amid vocal protests by environmentalists.  According to managing editor Jim Godbold, "We think the issues raised by the arrest and confiscation of our material at Warner Creek are serious enough injuries to the First Amendment that they deserve to be heard in a federal courtroom."
</P>

<P>
The Forest Service is notoriously heavy-handed with its censorship, manipulation, and denial of information.  USFS forester Jeff DeBonis created <A HREF="http://www.afseee.org/">AFSEEE</A> (The Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics) in response to repeated Forest Service suppression of information.
</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> likewise censors and impedes outside investigations.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> recounts obstruction, inexplicable omissions, and other chicanery on the part of the Park Service.  It took a court order to force the Yellowstone Institute, an "independent" organization chaired by the then-president of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</A>, to add this challenging book to the visitor centers' publications.  Those advantaged by the status quo colluded to hide it.
</P>

<P>
Honest assessments are difficult to come by because, as Chase says, "The usual fate of whistleblowers kept many officials silent, and the threat of losing their prerogative to study in Yellowstone frequently inhibited university scholars."  That's exactly what happened to Professors John and Frank Craighead.  Before their highly critical research could be completed, the world's grizzly experts' Yellowstone cabin, with all their data, mysteriously burned down.
</P>

<P>
The need to protect whistleblowers is not limited to public lands agencies.  In June of 1996 the Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving landfill user fees, that independent government contractors, like government employees, are "protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory action" for failing to follow the agency's "party line".  According to Justice O'Conner, "[The threat of retaliation against contractors] may chill speech on matters of public concern by those who, because of their dealings with the government, are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work."  Threats to environmental whistleblowers are widespread.
</P>

<P>
Take the case of Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/">Washington State University</A>.  After he testified against expanding the subsidies of the Columbia Basin Project, State Senator Tub Hansen reportedly met with the dean of the School of Agriculture to have Whittlesey's tenured position eliminated.  When that failed, Hansen then tried to make Whittlesey's salary as a line item in the state budget so it could be eliminated in committee.  Speaking truth to power is hazardous duty.
</P>

<P>
In popular press, we can also see political interests shackling free speech.  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A> environmental reporter Keith Schneider was among the most prominent writers to be removed from his post for honest reporting.  He bucked the envrionmentalist orthodoxy by writing about trade-offs to environmental regulations and cleanup, and quickly found himself out of work.
</P>

<P>
And then there is Gregg Easterbrook, author of <CITE>A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism</CITE>.  He notes that his personal popularity plummetted after publishing the book:  "My book was blistered by enviro lobbies....  Wham!  I had hit the Al Gore glass ceiling."
</P>

<P>
Another "green-listed" author was Tom Wicker, a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> columnist.  Last February, John Flicker, head of the <A HREF="http://www.audubon.org/audubon/">National Audubon Society</A>, demanded that Wicker's article be pulled from the Society's <CITE> Audubon</CITE> magazine because it criticized the Clinton Administration.
</P>

<P>
Protecting First Amendment rights empowers environmental reform.  When federal agencies control information, abuses of authority often follow.  Environmental orthodoxy and bureaucratic expediency often trump honest and free reporting.  
</P>

<P>
If the environmental movement is to motivate innovative and scientifically sound reform, we must encourage dissenters to speak and be vigilant in keeping government agencies from controlling information.  
</P>

<P>
The alternative is to quietly slip towards an Orwellian nightmare with government as the "Ministry of Truth".  Too melodramatic?  Take a look the California EPA's recent "record retention policy":
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>Please dispose of all documents... [electronic mail] messages and other communications prepared during the course of policy formulation which contain other policy proposals not adopted or reflected in the final decision.</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<H1>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P>
<P>
A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P>
Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P>
Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P>

<H1>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>

<P>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>

<P>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P>

<P>
Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>

<P>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>

<P>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle.  
</P>

<P>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P>

<P>
A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>

<P>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>

<P>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.

<H1>Using a Green Thumb to Hitch an Internet Ride</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Deep ecologists urge us to "return to nature".  If we reconnect with nature in a primitive, spiritual way, we may spare mother earth.  Reject science, technology, and the market for small-scale, Edenic lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
I like their goals of environmental protection and sustainability, but their means are dangerously misguided.  A "return to nature" will increase our dependence and consumption of natural resources and our ecological footprint.  
</P>
<P>
In the real world, environmental quality must harmonize with economic progress and sustainable growth.  Entrepreneurs catalyze this harmony by innovating new and better technologies, business practices, and institutions and arrangements.  They distance mankind's activities from nature, leaving more room for both.  
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs often convert industrial waste into useful products.  In the last century, logs were "boomed" into rafts and floated to mills.  Some of the best, most dense old-growth sunk to the bottom of waterways.  Superior Logging Co. is planning to "harvest" 30,000 of these logs from the bottom of Lake Superior.  Company founder Scott Mitchen says, "We're not endangering any spotted owls.... This wood is totally PC.  Any environmentalist has got to love it."  
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Patagonia makes plastic trash into fabric for clothing.  Profitable recycling industries across the nation reduce our dependence on virgin natural resources.  A Vancouver, BC firm has invented a process to dispose of organic garbage (which accounts for 80% of an average American's rubbish) by superheating it into a fuel that, when burned with coal, produces low-pollution power.  Their eco-friendly enterprise relieves pressures on landfills, sanitizes coal power plants, and scores profits.
<P>
The Pacific Northwest is a prime example of how distancing ourselves from the environment can protect nature.  Now, more Northwesterners write software than log trees.  And, some privately owned forests are effectively modelled and managed with computers -- increasing productivity and reducing acres cut.
</P>
<P>
"Cyberfarms" exemplify entrepreneurial innovation fostering environmental quality and economic progress.  One pioneer in this field, <A HREF="http://www.ashtech.com">Ashtech Inc.</A>, operates from Belgrade, Mont.  They help precision farmers use satellite-based Global Position Systems (GPS) to receive essential agricultural data as they drive combines, fertilizer trucks, and spray rigs over their fields.  GPS information tracks variations in elevation, soil composition, weather, and productivity -- down to the square foot.  Cyberfarmers can then make minute adjustments in seeding, fertilizing, and irrigating their fields.
</P>
<P>
Precision farming helps improve crop yields, producing more food on less land.  In addition to being more productive, cyberfarmers have a "green" thumb. With GPS technology farmers no longer need to uniformly blanket their fields with pesticides, water, fertilizer, and other potentially environmentally damaging inputs.  Rather, they can target specific amounts to the areas where they'll be most beneficial.  They save money by reducing chemicals, fertilizers insecticides, herbicides, and water.  High-technology farming can help meet the growing demands of a hungry planet by reducing our use of the land itself.
</P>
<P>
"Cybercommuting" enables us to tread more lightly on the earth as workers ply their trade from home.  Improvements in telecommunication technology enable people to transmit projects and ideas instantaneously across long distances and develop "virtual offices".  Why drive into the office?  Shoppers can buy their fall wardrobe by phone from the <A HREF="http://www.landsend.com">Lands' End</A> catalog, have their <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><I>Wall Street Journal</I></A> delivered via email, or buy their next book from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">"Amazon.com"</A> on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Cybercommuting and the telecommunications revolution have enormous potential for reducing pollution, resource consumption, and environmental impact.  Technological progress makes possible new, environmentally friendly ways to work by decreasing costs and increasing productivity.  Concurrently, environmentally sensitive commuting and communicating leads to economic progress.
</P>
<P>
These entrepreneurial success stories imply an environmnetalism nearly opposite that of conventional environmentalists.  Rather than "return to nature", we must "decouple" ourselves from nature.  Divorcing economic growth from natural resources gives nature room to adjust and repair.  The decoupling also promotes the prosperity so strongly linked to environmental sensitivity.  Richer is not only healthier and safer (more nutritious foods and fewer occupational hazards), richer is also ecologically more sound.
</P>
<P>
Economic development increasingly comes from innovating technologies and business practices -- not exploiting more natural resources.  Entrepreneurs catalyze these developments.  By encouraging "green" entrepreneurs, we foster low environmental impact.  When green thumbs grow better crops with satellites or hitch a ride to work on the Internet, creative resources help nature.
</P>
<P>
We can learn from cyberfarms and cybercommuters.  Both harmonize economic progress with environmental protection.  They ignore or reject the "return to nature" dictum.  They generate economic progress through innovations with benign environmental implications.  Environmental policy will improve when environmentalists recognize that environmental protection increases with such economic prosperity.  
</P>
<P>
The first rule of policy analysis is simple: not all good things go together.  Fortunately, some do.  The task for the policy entrepreneur is to find responsible and sensible alternatives to regulations which stifle entrepreneurial success.

<H1>Entrepreneurs Harmonize Economies with Ecology</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> Let's celebrate our most creative laborers -- the entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs have been neglected by economists and ignored or derided by environmentalists.  Environmentalist Al Gore sees entrepreneurial innovation as &quot;alchemy of a very dangerous form&quot;.  Economist Mark Casson notes that economic modelling &quot;leaves no role for the entrepreneur.&quot;  The economics discipline has become ever more abstract and mathematical.  Economists are selected for their sophistication in math and statistics, not their understanding of how the world works.  They have no way of modelling the creative uncertainty of entrepreneurs.  Hence, economics neglects them.</P>

<P>This is too bad, because everyone works for love and money and no one gets enough of either.  It is indeed unfortunate that entrepreneurs aren't at least appreciated if not loved for they are the catalysts of progress and change.  They seek opportunities to create value--but the values sought need not be measured in dollars.</P>

<P>We find successful entrepreneurs in the environmental and human service contexts but more would be welcome.  They created Habitat for Humanity, the <A HREF="http://www.rmef.org">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A> and Eagle Mount (a Bozeman organization providing skiing, horseback riding and other outdoor activities to disabled children). </P>

<P>Here's one way entrepreneurs affected the wood products industry.  Just twenty years ago approximately 40% of the logs brought to mills ended as waste.  Processing and disposing of the unusable wood cost labor and money and resulted in pollution.  Teepee burners converted nearly half of each log into disposable wastes, toxic by-products, and sulphurous air pollution.</P>

<P>Radical environmentalists used such examples to advocate a &quot;return to nature&quot;.  They rejected capitalism, science, technology, and economic progress.  Mankind should break the shackles of urban decay and industrial blights like the paper mills, and become hunter-gatherers and organic farmers, living in peace with the land.  Their romantic solution ignores the power of the entrepreneur to bring economic progress and environmental improvement.  The next chapter in the timber mill story illustrates this.</P>

<P>Since the 1970s, entrepreneurial innovation has transformed forest products into a leaner, cleaner industry.  Entrepreneurs found value where waste and pollution once dominated.  They effectively processed the once unusable fiber into valuable goods like particle board.  Entrepreneurial energies created value while by reducing industrial impact on the environment.  The teepee burners were closed and industrial waste became useful products.  Today, less than 5% of wood rolling into timber mills is wasted and pollution has been cut 80 to 90 percent.</P>

<P>This entrepreneurial success story reveals a solution antithetical to radical environmentalism.  Bringing the masses closer to nature will make them more reliant on natural resources, like trees, soil, and rivers.  This primitive, decentralized dependency will lead to increasing, not decreasing, environmental pressures.  Professor Martin Lewis writes in his book, Green Delusions, &quot;If we were all to split wood, the United States would be a deforested, soot-choked wasteland within a few decades.&quot;</P>

<P>Alternatives to improving environmental quality require tapping entrepreneurial ingenuity and harmonizing our economies with our ecologies.  For example, copper mining once faced dual problems: massive pit mines scarred the countryside and a global copper shortage seemed imminent.  Now, pit mining is in decline and copper is abundant, because entrepreneurs found a better way.  They found sand.</P>

<P>To meet the demands of the the Information Age, entrepreneurs discovered and implemented a substitute for copper in the form of sand-based fiber optics.  A fiber optic cable made of 25 kilograms of sand can transmit the same information as a cable made from 1,000 tons of copper.</P>

<P>Such progress pinpoints the key entrepreneurial role.  Today, soft drink cans require only a fifth of the metal that they needed in 1975.  We adopt stronger metals, better energy efficiency, and smarter designs as entrepreneurs move up learning curves.</P>

<P>Entrepreneurs are also important in the policy arena.  Groundwater in the Los Angeles basin is valuable.  After World War II, the race to pump water from the West and Central Basins jeopardized the water supply.  In her study of groundwater management, Dr. Elinor Ostrom emphasizes &quot;how public entrepreneurship can be used as a strategy to transform the structure of incentives facing those jointly using a [natural resource]&quot; into effective, sustainable solutions.  Public entrepreneurs devised arrangements where water pumpers manage themselves to conserve the resource.</P>

<P>The growth of service industries in America, the Information Age, miniturization and the search for &quot;green technologies&quot; all point to a future where economic progress includes environmental protection.  Many perceptions of the old &quot;growth versus nature&quot; trade-off are false.  With institutions that provide regulatory stability and secure property rights, ecology, liberty, and prosperity become complements, not competitors.  We can hope that some year a political entrepreneur will understand these possibilities and mobilize reform. </P>

<H1>Conquest of the Columbia Carried Tremendous Costs</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P>Some books change our thinking about institutions long taken for granted. Marc Reisner's <CITE>Cadillac Desert</CITE> explained how Western water flows uphill toward political payoffs.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> exposed the politics which trump both science and economics in our national parks.  They herald fundamental reform by publicizing the gaps between intentions and results.  They show how agencies created to promote the public interest become part of an iron triangle of special interests.  The beneficiaries become accustomed to the arrangements and view them as entitlements and a way of life.  </P>

<P>Blaine Harden's new book, <CITE>A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia</CITE>, describes such a situation.  The series of dams throttling the Columbia River and its tributaries delivers approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of water each year to 4,000 farmers in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project.  The average Project Farm has received a taxpayer subsidy of at least $2.1 million in the irrigation infrastructure.  The government also guarantees electricity to Project farmers at one twenty-seventh the wholesale price.</P>

<P>Cheap power entices farmers to pump water to their crops, sell excess water to their neighbors, generate electricity from the water flowing through their irrigation canals, and then sell that electricity at market rates.  Ninety percent of the cost of a profitable farm in the Project is borne by taxpayers and electricity consumers elsewhere in the country.</P>

<P>Of course, Project farmers love this system; &quot;The more water they suck out of the river, the more profits they have.&quot;</P>

<P>In the Colmbia Basin, federal hydroelectric and irrigation programs from the New Deal have transformed once-arid farmland into a bountiful region producing alfalfa for Japanese cattle and 80% of America's fast-food french fries.  </P>

<P>In Harden's words, the Columbia &quot;was killed more than sixty years ago and was reborn as plumbing.&quot;  The river where Lewis and Clark encountered &quot;verry bad&quot; whitewater rapids is now operated to mimick a lake sufficiently placid and stagnant for hydroplane races.</P>

<P>Special interests tranformed the Columbia into plumbing.  According to historian Donald Worster, the Columbia was killed by dams and reborn as money.  Hydroelectric dams mean big money to farmers, utilities, electricity consumers, the federal Bureau of Reclamation, and barge operators between Portland and Lewiston, Ida.  New tourist and recreation industries, like windsurfing the Gorge, are inextricably tied to the river.</P>

<P>The federally subsidized conquest of the Columbia had its costs.  Indian tribes lost their culture, their land, and their river.  Today, 60,000 commercial fishing jobs are in jeopardy.  And taxpayers still foot the bill.  The last, and perhaps most pivotal, victim is the endangered salmon, for the conquest of the Columbia has decimated the region's wild populations.  Over a quarter of the Northwest's salmon stocks are extinct, and half are endangered.</P>

<P>We can learn from Harden's stories:  First, to restore the Columbia and its salmon, we must understand the diverse special interests surrounding the river.  And second, subsidies and powerful centralized government action create special interests and institutionalize and channel their support.  The result is overexploitation of both the environment and the federal budget.</P>

<P>Harden repeatedly demonstrates the effects of the &quot;iron triangles&quot; in the Columbia.  An agency embarks on a public works project, private groups organize to collect those benefits, and they in turn support politicians who continue funding the agency's projects.  </P>

<P>Harden tells how this political juggernaut brought pressure to bear on dissenters, like Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">Washington State University</A>, who testified against the inefficiencies and wealth transfers of massive Project subsidies.  Bureaucrats routinely suppressed evidence or simply ignored their deleterious effects on indians, salmon, and the environment.  Farmers, barge operators, and utilities remain in denial.  Harden quotes a teacher at <A HREF="http://www.bbcc.ctc.edu">Big Bend Community College</A> in Moses Lake, Brenda Teals, who says, &quot;Farmers think those irrigation ditches fell out of the sky.&quot;</P>

<P>The vast majority of worthwhile irrigation projects were built privately and without federal subsidies.  Only after the best sites were developed were government subsidies required.</P>

<P>Can taxpayers still afford the iron triangles created by grandiose government schemes?  The nation's taxpayers pay for 80% of most major irrigation projects.  The farmers are encouraged to draw as much water as they can, the federal agencies are encouraged to &quot;operate&quot; the river like a machine, and the politicians are encouraged to appropriate more funds for their contributors.</P>

<P>This iron triangle polarizes Northwesterners.  Harden relates &quot;the most enduring consequence of federal control in my home country was not pollution, but intolerance.&quot;  In Hanford, it was technocrats and technicians against indians and hayseeds.  On the river, it was barge pilots against windsurfers and fish lovers.  Inland, it was subsidized farmers against enviros seeking to dismantle the artificial foundation of the Northwest economy.  Along the Cascade Mountains, it is becoming &quot;East-siders&quot; versus &quot;West-siders&quot;.</P>

<P>The polarization has forest industries blaming dams, fishermen, and farmers. Farmers blame deep-sea gillnets.  Fishermen blame dam builders.  Barge operators blame bureaucratic meddling.  Federal agencies deny responsibility and point to hatcheries.  Utilities claim transporting salmon in trucks is better than letting them swim.  Consensus seems more distant than Lewis and Clark's past.</P>

<P>Salmon and Northwesterners cannot live in harmony when politics generate benefits.  The iron triangles produce toxic byproducts.  As President Clinton has proclaimed, the era of Big Government is over.  Blaine Harden's book tells why we should be grateful. </P>

<H1>Finding Defenses Against Parasitic Bureaucracies</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>More young Americans believe in UFOs than believe they'll receive Social Security.  Only 25% of Americans trust the federal government.  30 years ago it was 75%.  No wonder -- the federal government now runs trillion-dollar deficits, dedicates 15% of its budget to pay interest on the national debt, and spends two-thirds of what remains on entitlements programs.  One entitlement to <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa241es.html">Archer Daniels Midland Co.</A>, the nation's leading ethanol producer, costs taxpayers $30 for every $1 of ADM profits.  </P>

<P>Behavioral ecology helps explain these findings.  Governments become parasitic; they get their hooks into and drain productive individuals and groups.  </P>

<P>The authors of the U.S. Constitution well understood the problems of political parasitism.  They knew that the default position is for government to become a parasitic agent that feeds off involuntary hosts without providing commensurate benefits.  Constant vigilance is required to forestall this outcome.</P>

<P>Our government is a social arrangement legitimized by the consent of the governed.  The constitution sets the rules for making laws and regulations.  Citizens sacrifice certain rights to guarantee predictable, social order.</P>

<P>In principle, nearly all sane people find these sacrifices preferable to anarchy.  It makes little difference whether we drive on the right or left side of the road, as long as we all drive on the same side.  Having government select and enforce one side benefits society immensely at little cost.  In many ways, great and subtle, government is a social lubricant.  </P>

<P>But there is a profound tension inherent to political management.  The key social lubricant, government, is also the ultimate source of coercion.  Government can make life easier by establishing courts and minting currency, but can it stop there?  </P>

<P>When government becomes the Welfare and Nanny State its major functions are to redistribute wealth and opportunities.  Government bureaucracies generate no wealth on their own.  Unlike private, independent actors who must rely on mutually beneficial, voluntary agreements, federal bureaucracies depend on taxation and forced transfers.  Their lifeblood is siphoned from successful individuals and organizations.  There are huge temptations for government to expand its activities and become an economic parasite.</P>

<P>Michael Rothschild, in his book <A HREF="http://www.bionomics.org/text/resource/biobook.html"><CITE>Bionomics</CITE></A>, describes economic parasites as organisms that &quot;use secrecy, deception, brute force, and legal authority as their 'hooks'.&quot;  No doubt active government agencies use all of the above tactics, some more than others.  The <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us">U.S. Forest Service</A>, quietly loses a billion dollars a year managing lands it got for free.  It relies on an oblivious public who loves Smokey but is largely ignorant of how Forest Service operations deplete our forests, divide our communities, and depreciate our economies.</P>

<P>Federal subsidies to ethanol producers, championed by Bob Dole (&quot;Senator Ethanol&quot;, according to his own press release), are predicated on the deception that they save energy and improve air quality.  They epitomize corporate welfare and gross economic inefficiencies.  The <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov">Fish and Wildlife Service</A>, in forcing landowners to provide habitat for endangered species, is one of many agencies who implement brute force as its hook.  These parasitic agencies drain their host (taxpayers, landowners) usually without their consent.</P>

<P>Society needs defenses against parasites, just as our bodies do.  When economic parasitism comes from criminals, government is expected (and funded by taxes) to intervene.  What happens when government IS the economic parasite?  The Founders' question, &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; (who will monitor the monitors themselves) has no satisfactory answer.</P>

<P>Behavioral ecology can offer great insight here.  Humans, their pets, fruits, and other organisms have been plagued by parasites throughout history.  Society has devised many treatments to mitigate harm, especially when cures are not available.</P>

<P>Traditional treatments often include some form of quarantine.  Parasites need a host.  By isolating parasites from potential new hosts, the parasite will eventually die.  Quarantining fruits, pets, and the infirmed is an example of this.  Similarly, the Bubonic Plague was tackled by implementing waste management practices which separated rat habitat from human habitat.</P>

<P>Successes against biological parasites can be translated to political economy.  Imprisoning criminals effectively quarantines them.  Likewise, by quarantining an activist, parasitic government, its many bureaucratic tentacles will wither.  </P>

<P>This is what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind:  a limited government, based on a system of checks and balances and a Bill of Rights which protects individuals and states from incursions of a parasitic Big Government.  The limited, quarantined government could still do its essentials (like protect from invasions and select which side of the road to drive on), but couldn't engage in the parasitic behavior that is epidemic today.</P>

<P>Free speech and press are essential to stopping parasitism by secrecy and deception.  &quot;Just compensation&quot; and the Fifth Amendment prohibition on forcing citizens to house soldiers during wartime are examples of efforts to prevent parasitism of a police state.  And the Tenth Amendment's oft-neglected mandate that &quot; powers not delegated to the United States... are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people&quot; was meant to curtail parasitism of a totalitarian government.</P>

<P>The Constitution was designed to be our first line of defense against economic parasitism.  Yet today we see generalized disenchantment with both major parties.  This is a predictable consequence of parasitic government.  And the costs of lost efficiency are small when compared to those of lost civic virtue among national politicians.  We will not see faith restored in federal government while it's used as an engine of plunder. </P>

<H1>Helping to Build a Sustainable Next West</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>The Gallatin Institute links writers of the West with environmental economists.  Last weekend poets, novelists, historians and essayists spent three days exploring ideas and ideals with policy analysts at the Gallatin Gateway Inn, a beautifully restored railroad hotel between Bozeman and West Yellowstone, Montana.    </P>

<P>Such communication is something new because the participants come from disparate tribes.  Their brains seem programed to see and process different kinds of information.  Artists and analysts seldom mingle easily.  A shared commitment to help build a sustainable next West, based upon local communities and respect for the lessons of our history and bio-geography, brought them together.  </P>

<P>Why intermingle artists and economists?  Mixing cultures is difficult and dangerous.  It's a risky venture but one worth undertaking.  Writers sensitize us to values and to new ways of seeing them.  Analysts help us understand how we might better cooperate to realize those values.</P>

<P>I've known sensitive people who define economists as those who &quot;know the price of everything but the value of nothing&quot;.  At best, they are only half right; as Thomas Sowell observed, the variables which economists can measure are not those that matter most.  </P>

<P>This is inherent to the nature of the world.  No matter how smart, how well funded, or how powerful their computer, analysts will never put a good metric on friendship, beauty, trust or peace.  Good economists know the limitations of their discipline.  </P>

<P>Yet microeconomics, the study of choice in public and private arenas, has important explanatory power.  This discipline has great potential for improving environmental policy.  Any proposal for reform that violates economic principles or the laws of nature is doomed.</P>

<P>When we apply these economic principles to problems, we can make predictions.  Specifically, if some behavior's cost, in terms of reputation, comfort or money, increases, and the benefits of that behavior remain constant, then we'll see less of that behavior.  For example, if litterers were subjected to the lash and branded on their foreheads with a L, then we'd see less littering.   Conversely, if landowners were rewarded for attracting and harboring endangered species, rather than penalized as they are now, more species would be safe.  The principles are quite simple but have profound implications.</P>

<P>It is likely that the evolutionary process has hard-wired these responses into our nature; they are strong survival characteristics.  People who act in accordance with these principles are more likely to do well and enjoy a good life than those who do not.  I have long argued that economics so understood is merely a division of the more general field of evolutionary biology.  </P>

<P>Understanding of economic principles helps us separate hopes for the future from expectations about that future.  As smart people experience life, they are ever better at making these distinctions.  </P>

<P>This ability to distinguish hopes from expectations is an important measure of practical intelligence.  Those who lack it are most charitably described as naive.  But some old-line paleo-enviros still reject economic analysis.  As one said, &quot;the word economics makes me hiss like The Hobbit's Gollum: I hates it, I hates it, I hates it forever.&quot;</P>

<P>Is it ethically or intellectually responsible to remain willfully ignorant?  Thanks to the work of researchers such as Lynn Scarlett, Randal O'Toole and Tom Power, sincere environmentalists increasingly see the value of political economy and policy analysis. </P>

<P>This helps explain why environmentalists have become skeptical about utopian schemes.  As smart people experience life's successes and failures, they develop an intuitive sense of these economic principles.  They recognize that there are no perfect solutions, only many competing tradeoffs.   </P>

<P>Learning by trial and error is grossly inefficient.  Explanation of principles by sensitive and empathetic teachers works much better.  However, economists are selected for analytical skills and abstract logic, not empathy and sensitivity.  Economists are among the few who find Calculus a compelling form of communication.  Few economists communicate easily with artists.</P>

<P>Economists' powerful analytic leverage can help us deal with problems, but only if they connect and communicate with those who care deeply about environmental quality.  Most people need to know how much you care before they care how much you know.  If economists are perceived as calculating not compassionate, their contributions will be resisted.  </P>

<P>Rejection of analysis and economic reasoning retards environmental reform.  The success of dialogues, such as the one hosted by the Gallatin Institute, gives us prudent optimism as we contemplate the next West. </P>

<H1>Park Lovers Can Save National Parks</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>As Americans flock to national parks this summer, we can learn a lot from national parks around the world.  Field biologists the world over uniformly confirm the woeful conditions of national parks.  <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A> found many national parks in Latin America are at great risk.  Even closer to home, Canada's experiments with national parks hold important lessons for parks lovers.</P>

<P>Canadian parks are now suffering from their reliance on fickle politics.  The Canadian analog of the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov">U.S. National Park Service</A>, Parks Canada, just lost $100 million dollars from its budget to operate 38 parks.  The U.S. park system has ten times as many parks and a budget of only $1.3 billion.</P>

<P>U.S. park managers, already short funding, cut popular services such as the Norris Campground in Yellowstone.  Let's consider alternative managerial arrangements in the U.S. before mounting financial pressures in Washington, D.C. force a repeat of Canada's predicament.</P>

<P>Public, nongovernment endowment boards, one for each park, hold great promise.  They successfully manage private schools, nonprofit hospitals, and museums.  Board members have trustee and fiduciary responsibility for their organization's specific mission.  The boards would be charged to manage for highest values: habitat, preservation, primitive recreation, scenery.  An endowment board with regional and national members could ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics.</P>

<P>Petty politics puts national parks at risk.  The 104th Congress is considering eliminating unworthy parks.  Although park budgets rose every year from 1955 to 1977, Congress has cut funding in one out of every three years since.  A quarter of park ranger jobs have disappeared since 1987, and there is a $3 billion maintenance backlog.  Our parks are in terrbile shape, ecologically and operationally.</P>

<P>While not providing adequate funding for existing parks, Congress creates new parks of highly questionable value, like Presidio and Steamtown.  This political trap has caught Canada, which just combined massive budget reductions for Parks Canada with the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park, now Canada's fifth largest.</P>

<P>Government support for parks is problematic for many reasons.  Politicizing national parks leads to &quot;park&quot; barrel projects and poor management incentives.  Sound science loses out when special interests can order the Park Service to eliminate Yellowstone's wolves in the 1920s and fires since 1900.  Fuel loads build ever higher and dangers rise.  We can soon expect huge, destructive fires rather than many small, natural ones.</P>

<P>Making park budgets dependent on politics rather than the parks' net revenues also distorts decisions and encourages bureaucratic inefficiencies. Park Service construction budgets routinely include 50% extra for overhead and overruns.  Parks' user fees and concessionaire fees go to Washington.  The resulting underpriced or free access encourages overuse of our parks.  Increasingly, the park system is characterized by low quality new parks and degraded old ones.</P>

<P>Supporters of legislation now before Congress believe corporate sponsorship of national parks holds the solution.  The proposal's main stumbling block is public apprehension about commercialization of our parks.  It's understandable that, as the Olympics draw near, we guard against &quot;Disney-fied&quot; parks, like a Timex Old Faithful or a Ranier Beer Ranier National Park.  </P>

<P>How do we guard against such crass commercialization?  Endowment boards, with their membership, drawn from environmental, community, business, and science leaders have incentives to seek subtle, tasteful sponsorship and public support.  If trustees fail to honor a binding mandate to foster values specific to each park, then they suffer reputational and other losses.</P>

<P>As with other environmnetal issues, we face trade-offs not perfect solutions.  Even cynical observers note that the threat of commercialization is less serious than the current slide in services and sustainability.  Independence Hall is in desperate need of roof repairs and modern fire sprinklers.  Should we let 20th Century Fox put &quot;Official Sponsor of Independence Hall National Park&quot; on its &quot;Independence Day&quot; movie billboards?   What if the alternative is to let this park go up in smoke?</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship could make a huge difference.  Ford Motor Company recently purchased 20 pages in Newsweek dedicated to the national park system.  Ten were Ford ads, ten were travel brochures for various national parks like Crater Lake and Big Bend.  The ad space alone cost around $1.5 million. While pocket change to Ford, this sum equals the operating budget of the average U.S. National Park.</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship of the national park system is part of a larger movement to separate Park Service funding from Congress.  Only when park budgets are depoliticized will America have a vibrant and long-lasting park system.  Creating mechanisms for collecting payment from various park beneficiaries is an important step in this direction.  User fees, gifts from membership organizations, concessionaire contracts, and corporate sponsorships all have potential.  Instituting endowment boards to generate and manage these funds will foster the necessary trust, sensitivity, and responsibility.</P>

<P>National parks are failing to deliver the quality or stability park-lovers demand.  Support and management of our national heritage must come from the people who appreciate and benefit from those parks.  When parks must pay their own way through fees and friends, we'll see more responsible stewardship.  The parks are too precious for a precarious dependency on politics.</P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>6/12/96</P><H1>Wildlands: salvation through decentralization</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>Americans are increasingly concerned about our wildlands.  Historically we looked toward federal custodians.  But, if you believe that Congress will respond with large appropriations, read no further.</P>

<P>The federal government has made promises it cannot afford to keep.  The implications preclude an expanded federal wildlands system.  What will happen when actual spending cuts become unavoidable?  As the 104th Congress demonstrates, environmental expenditures are prime targets.</P>

<P>Yet, as our ecological understanding increases, we realize that large, intact systems are important.  David Quammen, author of <CITE>Song of the Dodo</CITE>, notes that wildlands cannot exist merely as &quot;island ecologies&quot;.  Without linking large, diverse areas and populations, island ecologies are doomed to stagnate and fail.  But will wildlands be worth their political cost to politicians?</P>

<P>Already, half the federal budget goes to Medicare and Social Security.  This drain is projected to double in the next 40 years.  What will be left for wildlands?  And where would federal wildlands be if revenue-hungry Congressmen, pressured by retired baby boomers, propose selling off bits and pieces of federal lands to fund the boomers' retirement?  </P>

<P>According to a Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation report, <CITE>The View from Airlie</CITE>, such mischief is endemic to top-down control where local sites &quot;offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Allowing the political process to determine the priority of wildlands designations invites michief.  With the Presidio, an old naval base, becoming a national park, might the <A HREF="http://www.pmrma-www.army.mil/rma.html">Rocky Mountain Arsenal</A> be designated a Wilderness Area? (This would eliminate the required cleanup.)</P>

<P>We expect politicians' attention spans to reach only to the next election, but wildlands require long-term stewardship.  These two time frames are incompatible.  Politicians aren't held accountable for events after they leave office.</P>

<P>Yet, the stubborn reliance on command-and-control by orthodox environmentalists ignores these structural impediments to a federal wildlands program.  We need new institutional arrangements to protect massive tracts of wildlands.  Responsible and constructive proposals are required.  Here are a few ideas.</P>

<P>Across America, untold multitudes of environmentally sensitive landowners are eager to manage their land for environmental ends but are afraid of political entanglements and potential takings.  The Safe Harbor program in North Carolina is successful because it responds to landowner concerns.  It is expected to double the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker population through voluntary agreements with landowners. Previously, the arrival of these woodpeckers meant losing control of their property.  Landowners enrolled in Safe Harbor have their rights protected.  If they attract woodpeckers they may continue active forestry and agriculture.  Similar programs can link large tracts of wilderness without removing land from all productive uses.</P>

<P>Creativity, flexibility, and adaptability are essential in coordinating habitat and wildlands.  These are not attributes of governmental bureaucracies.  Environmental entrepreneurs, however, like leaders of the <A HREF="http://www2.rmef.org/rmef/">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A>, specialize in identifying conservation opportunities and building a constituency for wildlands.  Likewise, other conservationists could invest in wildlands based on voluntary agreements and mutual exchange.</P>

<P>When governments restrict use of private wildlands, landowners have strong incentives to develop their property before a bureaucrat comes locking.  In the voluntary sector, on the other hand, landowners are rewarded if their parcels qualify as wildlands and become attractive to a regional &quot;Wildlands Easement Trust&quot;.  </P>

<P>A regional Wildlands Easement Trust would have a board of trustees, similar in operation to those of museums and hospitals.  This decentralized approach allows caretaking priorities to adapt to increases in scientific understanding.</P>

<P>Such an approach wouldn't rely on massive federal land acquisition or regulatory intervention.  This different path to the same goal promises better results with less confrontation.  Dave Foreman founded <A HREF="http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/campaigns/ef/earthfirst.html">Earth First!</A> because of his frustration with the pro-environment but entirely statist Carter Administration.  He observes &quot;conservationists have relied too much on federal government law and regulation&quot;.  He reminds us that it &quot;has also been easier to pass federal laws than to work out good conservation through the free market or through voluntary agreements.&quot;</P>

<P>Preserving vast tracts of land, as Wildlands Easement Trusts promise to do, is a daunting task not amenable to quick fixes.  The dangerous temptation is to rely upon governments alone to constrain those who would gladly plunder our natural heritage.   America's heritage is not about coercing dissenters into obedient silence.  As Alexis de Tocqueville explained early in our history, Americans excel at building voluntary institutions that foster cooperative pursuit of shared interests.  </P>

<P>Saving wildlands by dipping deeper into the U.S. Treasury is doomed to frustration and failure.  Federal management predictably fails to deliver environmental goods--be they commodities like timber or amenities like habitat.  There is an important federal role to monitor against abuse and adjudicate conflict.  Mischief follows when it tries to manage.</P>

<P>A decentralized and flexible approach, and positive incentives can make Wildlands Easement Trusts happen.  Private and public, nongovernmental wildlands provide our best and most realistic opportunities to further protect nature's precious gifts.</P>

<P>We have many successful models all across America:  the R Ranch in California, the Iram Wild Horse Preserve in South Dakota, Pennsylvania's <A HREF="http://jasper.stanford.edu/OBFS/stations/PA_Hawk_Mountain_Sanct..html">Hawk Mountain</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.biddeford.com/~mcht/trusts/mcht.htm">Maine Coast Heritage Trust</A>.  These nature preserves offer important lessons in the new environmentalism. </P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/29/96</P><H1>The predictable perversities of bureaucratic behavior</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>There is a strong tendancy for such organizations to be run for the benefit of those in charge.  This has profound implications for those in the agency and for those they are to serve.  </P>

<P>A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial portion of its budget from transfers.  When the bureaucracy is a government agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent.  I do not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest.  It impairs my viewshed, silts my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities, and lowers the value of my property.  Unfortunately, we have no choice but to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of what is right.  </P>

<P>What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt.  Its programs pay off too many politicians and special intersts to prevent this economically rational and environmentally preferrable outcome.  Unlike Apple Computer, the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist.  So long as their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can mix good deeds with genuine plunder.</P>

<P>Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization.   Most corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers  within the company, e.g. public affairs departments.  These units, however, are rarely if ever dominant.  Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that generate income by selling products to willing buyers.  While research and public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's mission than that of government agencies.  Deviations are constrained by those who watch the bottom line.</P>

<P>This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.  There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.  Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced sense of purpose.  Few organizations have it.</P>

<P>When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies' self-serving tendancies to become more pronounced.  For instance, although both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be more corrupt than the BIA.  Fortunately for their leaders, we will never know.  </P>

<P>Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university parking with that of shopping malls.  In malls, employees, including managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way, inconvenient location.  The decision-makers who determine parking rules find it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.</P>

<P>In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots marked with titles if not names.  Even a former university president, driven from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his preferential parking privileges.  The perfidious president preserved his privileges.</P>

<P>In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and control over resources.  This logic trumps the purpose justifying their creation.  What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the dark and slog through through seven months of Montana slush if those who make the rules are spared these costs?  A mall based on such privilege would soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such pressures.</P>

<P>None of this is surprising.  And it would be as naive to rail against as to protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by politicians.  That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate.  By then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.</P>

<P>In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix.  Ration the parking spaces by price.  People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in a cheap or free area.  Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries.  Truly handicapped individuals can have reserved parking.  I've yet to hear a reasonable objection to this. </P>

<P>Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land?  Such a reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little cost to pay for their privilege.  It was indeed an aberration when Congress made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live.  This too will erode.  For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.  To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.  </P>

<P>This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu">Montana State University</A> in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus parking. </P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/15/96</P><H1>Fostering a new west that respects old values</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.  Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives. They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and bring with them an utterly different value system for the land.  A value system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities. </P>

<P>To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation.  They demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values.  Many locals are resentful.   </P>

<P>     Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation and cooperation.  Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard labor that traditional Western jobs require.  And long-time residents need to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers.  Both must recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.   </P>

<P>     Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and values that have long defined the West.  Here's a story from a recent trip to <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State University</A>, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames the debate for me.  I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.</P>

<P>         I used to work in the woods.  Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and Idaho.  I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific Northwest, and  in 1977, I finally got the chance.  On sabbatical leave from my regular university post,  I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State University.  This left plenty of time to work in the woods.   </P>

<P>    Nearly 20 years later  I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a few days of meetings.  Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks and other signs of fundamental change.  While Ramona worked with her fellow academics, I rode my bike.  One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber.  I wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and maintained.  In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner.   Also, I needed a new saw.</P>

<P>     The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.  I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop.  It spent its declining years on our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood.  That's an easy life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.  </P>

<P>Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy.  It's hard-core, a good place to find recipes for spotted owl.  My Lycra was on trespass in corked-boot territory.  Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust was the same.  The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter.  He looked up from his work as I entered.  </P>

<P>     &quot;Hi, Ken,&quot; I said.  &quot;Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around 1977?  Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days a week?  You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd known he was professor.&quot;  I took off my Bolles.</P>

<P>     &quot;Damn! Hi, John.&quot; He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand.  We exchanged news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong reasons.  &quot;With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees,&quot; he said. &quot;Less wood more saws.  Not many pros in the woods anymore.&quot;  He is looking towards  the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years.  The changing values of the new West aren't for Ken.</P>

<P>     &quot;Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out.  Will you send me a new one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me,&quot; I said, &quot;but I have a Visa card.&quot;</P>

<P>     &quot;Hell, don't bother.  Just send me a check when you get home.&quot;</P>

<P>     The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:</P>

<P><CENTER>
LEBANON<BR>
Saw Shop Lebanon,<BR>
Oregon</CENTER></P>

<P>I put it on to finish writing this essay.  And I thought about trust-about how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust.  Twenty years and a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work honorably done. </P>

<P>     I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old.  Trust that comes from working together is high on my list.  Its presence in my own life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.  </P>

<H1>Marking the End of an Era of Crisis Entrepreneurship</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>, Vice President Al Gore writes in the book's Foreward, discusses &quot;compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  He calls it the sequel to the first enviromental benchmark, <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  He's wrong.  </P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> marks the end of an era of public susceptibility to ill-founded hysteria and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, serious and intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and posturing are pass&eacute; in the environmental policy arena.</P>

<P>The book's authors are Theo Colburn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a former reporter, respectively. This &quot;scientific detective story&quot; is provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot;  It charges synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, and Tide) with disrupting hormones.  They allege hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, ranging from illiteracy to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  Their solution?  Ban synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The book's timing is immaculate.  It comes as the National Academy of Sciences convenes to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrives on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day.  <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> has a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It is PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>Yet it's flopping.  Reputable responders trash the book.  The <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://update.wsj.com"><CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com"><CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE></A>, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>, and <CITE>Washington Times</CITE> have criticized the book for all manner of flaws, from hysteria mongering to junk science and from faulty logic to poor writing.  It's a sign we're making progess.  Here's why.</P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  That's good news for those of us who rank environmental quality among our highest priorities.  We learn more from failure than success, and this failure offers important lessons for environmental reformers.</P>

<P>People in the environmental movement are far more sophisticated today than in 1962.  They recognize that greens attract both &quot;crisis entrepreneurs&quot; and genuine advocates for the public interest.  These crisis hustlers generate new support by touting an emergency and then providing avenues down which people can parade their good intentions and express their sincerity by sending money.  Conservative, quiet groups such as the Isaak Walton League and American Forestry Association lose to those that emphasize drama, apocalypse, and urgency at the expense of intellectual integrity.  </P>

<P>But hysterical environmentalism ultimately backfires.  Greenpeace International's mission against chlorine is an excellent example.  Their anti-chlorine campaign led to Peru reducing the chlorine it added to its water supply.  The result?  A cholera epidemic swept through insufficiently chlorinated water supplies, taking far more lives than the chlorine ban could possibly have saved.</P>

<P>Colburn and friends deride the cancer scare of the early 1970s for turning cancer into &quot;the ultimate measure of our fears.&quot;  They see our preoccupation with high cancer rates as &quot;more myth than reality.&quot;  Scientists and regulators in the &quot;War on Cancer&quot; wasted precious time and resources.  Colburn recognizes the perils of overstating cancer threats.  Ironically, she tells us that, compared to cancer, hormone disruptors pose a far greater danger.  Disruptors may destroy humankind.</P>

<P>But, after a few scares, people become jaded and cynical.  Short-term opportunism thwarts constructive outcomes.</P>

<P>Such opportunism may work in the short-run, but it antagonizes scientists and policy analysts.  For example, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> greatly exaggerates the scientific consensus regarding declining sperm counts.  The book's misleading science invites criticism and undermines its alleged purpose.  It's immediate supporters are likely to feel as foolish by the autumn of the year 2000 as those who predicted global cooling should today.</P>

<P>Also, environmentalists can learn that benefits normally imply costs.  Only when they recognize both, and acknowledge inescapable trade-offs, can they recommend constructive and effective policies.  This is not a cost-free world.</P>

<P>But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> considers only the negative effects of synthetic chemicals.  It offers no appropriate responses.  If plastics, pesticides, and paints merely sabotaged our biochemistry, Colburn's recommended ban might make sense.  But synthetic chemicals are integral to modern civilization precisely because of their benefits.</P>

<P>Good public policy must incorporate the risks, benefits, and harms of each issue. Lorenz Rhomberg, Ph.D. of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis writes, &quot;a crash program of [hormone-disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.&quot;  Colburn ignores these trade-offs.</P>

<P>Sincere, sophisticated and sensible environmentalists shun chicanery and irresponsible reforms.  They see these proposals are more dangerous than the synthetic chemicals Colburn pillories.</P>

<P>Insisting that chemicals be presumed guilty of hormone disruption until proven innocent by chemical manufacturers is terribly foolish.  Even undergraduates should know one can't prove the negative.  Anyone can always claim we simply haven't looked hard enough.  By requiring chemical manufacturers to do the impossible, she dooms the beneficiaries a modern chemicals to the 1800s.  Failing to acknowledge the huge benefits of modern chemistry is naive or disingenuous.</P>

<P>Savvy Americans expect misguided policy proposals from even gifted scientists.  We understand that for PR firms image trumps truth.  We expect and understand when crisis entrepreneurs with Greenpeace incite panics to build budgets.  But why do smart scientists recommend pathologically unwise policies?</P>

<P>When scientists leave the lab and enter the policy arena, thier body temperatures and IQ scores often seem to converge.  A future scientific detective story may explain this tragic phenomenon.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> already has the answer:  hormone disruptors. </P>

<P>	I just returned from the other Washington, the one on the Potomac.  I met with people in think tanks, universities, the federal judiciary, and intellectuals from the Reagan Administration.  A common question was, &quot;are the Republicans in the 104th Congress brain damaged or just cowards?&quot;</P>

<P>	We all wondered what could possess Republicans to blatantly attack three decades of increased environmental sensitivity. Everett Carll Ladd's American Enterprise Institute study demonstrates America's overwhelming sympathy for environmentalism.  How did the Republicans think the public would receive their anti-environmental rhetoric?</P>

<P>	According to Newt Gingrich, Republicans simply miscalculated on the language they used.  And language is very important here.  Republicans were portrayed as &quot;dismantling 25 years of environmental protection&quot; and &quot;rolling back 25 years of environmental laws&quot;.  These are serious accusations.  Fortunately, they contain only a bit of truth.  </P>

<P>	By and large, Republicans, like other normal people, favor environmental protection.  They just don't believe that federal micro-management and intrusive regulations are the best approach.  Their attempts roll back the &quot;laws&quot; were largely misunderstood as attempts to eliminate environmental &quot;protection&quot;.</P>

<P>	Here is a great lesson for voters and elected officials alike:  It is the bureaucratic regulatory approach that voters rejected in 1994, not the environmental goals.  Americans are tired of intrusive, insensitive, and inefficient bureaucratic means to environmental ends.  Almost everybody favors environmental protection; the big difference is in how we achieve it.  </P>

<P>	Most of the new Republicans arrived in Washington not hoping to destroy our environment, but rather to transform the process and preserve it from the corruption, waste, and politicking inherent to Washington D.C.  Their deregulatory, limited-government approach contrasted sharply with the traditional environmentalist agenda of greater bureaucratic powers, increased federal control, and heightened paranoia over environmental problems.  </P>

<P>	This reform required fewer stringent environmental regulations and far more freedom to find new ways to achieve environmental goals.  &quot;Green&quot; groups took this as an attack.  Since the first Earth Day most environmental groups have relied on the heavy hand of federal management, detailed regulations, and larger subsidies.</P>

<P>	Reform demanded that Republicans confront orthodox command-and-control environmentalism.  However, extreme spokespeople like Don Young of Alaska and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho undermine the credibility of their reform.  They and their &quot;Wise Use&quot; constituents paraded under the banner of free enterprise while demanding a continuation of subsidies for outmoded, environmentally destructive exploitation of resources on public lands.  The other Republicans were either ignorant of the damages and distortions of subsidies or too cowardly to stand up against the outspoken, but misguided, representatives of Wise Use.</P>

<P>	While the Republican agenda presented several innovative ways to better the environment (like property rights protections and Superfund reform), they failed to provide a cohesive and mature vision for environmental protection.  According to Lynn Scarlett, Vice President of Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, &quot;Would-be reformers adopted a mirror image of their opponents' technocratic, top-down approach without thinking seriously about how to ensure environmental protection.&quot;  For example, mandatory cost-benefit analyses can make regulations more efficient, but they do not address the fundamental shortcomings of the regulatory approach. </P>

<P>	Conventional environmentalism overstepped its bounds through excessive regulations, uncompensated &quot;takings&quot;, and centralized control.  It has imposed unnecessary costs on everyone and pitted the environment against prosperity, rather than harmonizing these two complementary values.</P>

<P>	Some environmental gains were well worth the costs.  But their means neglected what economists call &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot;.  Ever increasing environmental regulation ultimately costs society more than it benefits.  In <CITE>Breaking the Vicious Circle</CITE>, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer identifies the rising costs of regulations like CAFE fuel economy requirements, EPA restrictions on benzene, and Superfund.</P>

<P>	Inflexible and exorbitantly expensive regulations are predictable consequences of separating power from responsibility.  When pollution is free to polluters, we get too much pollution.  Likewise, when regulations are free to the regulators, we get too much regulation.  But it's irresponsible to ignore trade-offs inherent in every policy.  Pursuing environmental goals with what Justice Breyer calls &quot;tunnel vision&quot; will squander billions of dollars.  This process will also trample individuals, communities, and even endangered species.  </P>

<P>	The high costs and ineffectiveness precipitated the voters' demand for fundamental changes.  The Republicans of the 104th Congress are indeed cowards if they ultimately accept a milder, more gentle orthodox environmentalism or continue the old, pork-barrel subsidies.  They also seem dim-witted when they fail to articulate an alternative environmental vision based on sound science, positive incentives, regulatory stability, responsibility, and secure property rights.</P>

<P>	Some political entrepreneur, Democrat, Libertarian, or Republican, will catalyze a new era of environmentalism -- a new shade of green.  Taking control away from bureaucracies and their advocates (be they industry or environmentalist) means allowing flexible adaptation to govern environmental stewardship.  The Nature Conservancy demonstrates flexible, innovative responses to Americans' demands for stewardship.  TNC has successfully tripled the acres it protects in the last 10 years by stressing its decentralized, local approach.  </P>

<P>	Features which characterize ecological systems, such as evolution, decentralization, and adaptability, can guide policy reform.  Ecological systems are much like economic systems.  Shared principles provide the key for a new environmental vision. The Republicans just haven't found it.  They must find courage to begin looking and exercise wisdom to use this key.</P>

<P>Water is precious to life on earth.  Healthy organisms, ecosystems, and weather cycles depend on it.  A sufficient supply of clean water is the critical first step to improving public health in every society.   Just because everyone needs water, however, doesn't make managing it easy.  Developing countries are struggling for water.  The <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</A> says $600 billion is needed in the next decade to avoid water shortages.</P>

<P>Even though Earth is mostly water, only about 1% of it is available freshwater.  And with global water consumption tripling since 1950, some claim it's only a matter of time before the strain on  the world's water supply becomes too great:  29 years according to Paul Ehrlich, Sandra Postel, and Gretchen Daily.  If you live where the Colorado River used to drain into the sea, or where the Aral Sea once existed, the time may already be now.  How we manage scarce water resources is increasingly vital, for public health as well as the health of wetlands, salmon runs, and other ecosystems.  That makes water delivery systems among the most important enterprises.</P>

<P>America's water management ideology flowed from the Progressive Era doctrine of a century ago.  Political leaders used tax-exempt government bonds to fund facilities and enabled bureaucracies to provide their burgeoning cities with water. As a result, 85% of Americans drink water from government-owned companies.  Public water companies, they thought, could easily, efficiently, and reliably supply municipal water.</P>

<P>The Progressives were wrong.  Time, and a recent study of California's water industry by the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, has proven them wrong.  The Reason Foundation surveyed private and public water companies in California and discovered that both offered comparable services.  To provide those same water services, however, the government-owned companies relied on tax exemptions and subsidies.</P>

<P>The private companies fended for themselves, and did so more efficiently.  Their water cost consumers only three-fourths that of public water.  Inefficiencies of government-owned water companies go beyond cost to consumers.  Their operating expenses per connection were 21% higher.  They required more than double the number of employees per connection.  Accordingly, salaries of public water companies ate up almost three times as much of the operating revenue as the private companies.  Public companies also spent nearly double their private counterparts on maintenance.</P>

<P>The good news for Californians is that even their wasteful government water companies are more efficient than some third-world water companies.  Most Latin American utilities require between ten and twenty employees per thousand connections (compared with 1.62 for private- and 3.49 for government-owned firms in Calif.).  No wonder that developing countries which are dominated by government-owned water industries &quot;require&quot; massive bailouts.  No wonder the specter of water shortages looms so closely.</P>

<P>The bad news is that 78% of Californians receive their water from wasteful public authorities.  The <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> finds that subsidizing public water passes no savings on to the consumer.  The subisidized inefficiencies effectively flush public funds that could instead be spent on more worthwhile undertakings or reduced taxes.</P>

<P>Public water companies are protected from competition.  Bloated payrolls, extravagant expenditures, and addiction to subsidized capital characterize government water works.  Government-owned agencies in California notoriously accumulated large cash and investment incomes.  The Irvine Ranch Water District, for example, invested $32.5 million in an apartment complex and another $12 million in two other real estate developments.  Allowing government agencies like water companies to speculate with public money leads to the financial nightmare that vexes Orange County today.</P>

<P>Privatization presents an attractive alternative in the U.S. and elsewhere.  England privatized its water industry in 1989.  French cities has been contracting their water systems since the 19th century.  Some international firms found great success in supplying water to developing nations badly in need of competent and competitive water systems.  In Buenos Aires, the government water authority was so inept that privatizing offered huge benefits.  Privatization has brought $4 billion in infrastructure investment, improved government pipelines that previously leaked half of their water, and resolved the chronic summer  water shortages.  This approach conserves the environment while promoting healthier and wealthier consumers in Brazil.</P>

<P>In America, municipal budgets are tightening.  Mayors increasingly seek new capital.  And proliferating environmental regulations make the water business ever more difficult for city bueaucracies.  These factors make change certain.  Privatization of much of the water industry is likely.  </P>

<P>Ironically, public water companies were intended to protect the sacred municipal water supply.  What really happens in socialized water systems, however, is something quite different.  Water and other resources are wasted and public health is at risk while political interests are protected.  Now, as Mr. Clinton claims the &quot;era of big government is over,&quot; we can find support for innovative ways to provide public goods.  It takes courage to overcome the outmoded Progressive thinking.  Fortunately, thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and others, the common sense to see the benefits of privatization is becoming more common. </P>

<P>	Economic analysis can promote environmental quality.  By identifying subsidies, inefficiencies, and new opportunities, economists apply their powerful analytical tools to environmental ends. </P>

<P>	Yet despite its great potential, economic analysis has failed to improve environmental policy in many areas.  Environmental regulators often ignore the importance of secure property rights and advocate regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of property with predictable and oft perverse consequences.  The Progressives of the early 20th Century, who established the federal land management bureaucracies, completely failed to understand why America's founders were so skeptical of activist, intrusive government.  The persistent failures of bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management illustrate the founders' wisdom.  And too often American ideals of limited government are ignored by agencies and special interests, both of whom gain through wasteful central planning that corrupts good intentions.</P>

<P>	Economists have failed to deliver their message because they are neither naturally inclined nor trained to communicate with intelligent non-specialists.  The language of economists, calculus and econometrics, are alien to most people.  Even when economists share environmental goals and interests with conventional greens, their message is unheard or misinterpretted.</P>

<P>	This communication gap between economists, environmental activists, and decision-makers inspired a new organization, the Gallatin Institute.  This non-profit, educational and research foundation links essayists, poets, and novelists with economists and policy analysts interested in environmental quality and sensitive to an emerging environmentalist culture.  Gallatin works with these purveyors of culture to forge innovative cultural and intellectual foundations for an emerging West.  </P>

<P>	Shared goals of sustainable economies, ecologies, and cultures would be at the heart of such a New West.  To get there, Gallatin first fosters exchange between writers and policy experts. Gallatin Fellows next take these messages to communities.  </P>

<P>	Environmental concerns increasingly affect the West.  Technically complex and highly emotional, they often pit ecological against other human values.  These ingredients for error and acrimony provide opportunities for demagogues to work their mischief.  Lies go undetected, truths untold, opportuism fostered.</P>

<P>	In pursuit of ecological integrity and viable economies, Gallatin Fellows respect the ideals of free and responsible individuals, the importance of community, and the value of voluntary cooperative actions. They agree productive and just economic and social coordination is rarely achieved through force, and never by fraud.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute develops thoughtful foundations for constructive policy reform.  With support from the Ford Foundation and others, Gallatin hosts working conferences and seminars and provides modest support for writers to produce popular and scholarly articles and books.  Its varied ideas and proposals respectfully recognize differing cultures and traditions of the old while articulating a vision for a new West. </P>

<P>	When a group of writers met some years back, they envisioned a West moving away from federal dependency, factious division, and unsustainable land use.  The Gallatin Institute emerged as one vehicle for ushering in a new West.  Its aim is not to provide &quot;the answer&quot; for the New West.  Rather, Gallatin promotes an ecumenical, constructive dialogue among leaders of rural communities, Western writers, and policy analysts.  Gallatin recognizes that the West must determine its own identity, its own future.</P>

<P>	The Institute's emphasis on fostering harmony and responsibility reflects its namesake, Albert Gallatin, the secretary of the treasury under Thomas Jefferson.  Albert Gallatin had coherent and yet diverse interests.  A fiscal conservative, he stressed simple government and ending public debt.  In spite of the Louisiana Purchase and preparations for the War of 1812, Gallatin cut the federal debt by 38% in eight years.  He strongly opposed war and was instrumental in negotiating peace with Britain.  Gallatin funded the Lewis and Clark expedition and founded New York University and the American Ethnological Society.  Like its namesake, Gallatin Institute fosters constructive and peaceful exchange to find a new identity in the West, based on responsibility, cultural and ecological harmony, and self-governance.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute brings eclectic writings to the media and general public through several avenues.  A new<CITE> Gallatin Journal</CITE>, based on writings brought to seminars and community gatherings, will be launched in mid-1996.  Two forthcoming Gallatin books, <CITE>The Next West</CITE> and <CITE>Writers on the Range</CITE>, were generated by the seminars.</P>

<P>	A series of op-ed pieces are published in local, regional, and national print and electronic media are produced by the Institute.  Under the banners of &quot;Range Writers&quot; and &quot;Writers on the Range&quot;, Gallatin's writers produce columns and articles to promote this dialogue in the West.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute is one of many examples of environmental entrepreneurship in action, this one in the intellectual arena.  The Institute recognizes the important morality, ethics, and the analytic power of economics to explore an emerging West.  When writers begin using the potent tools of economic analysis, and if even a few economists return to their ethical/moral roots in Moral Philosophy, then the 21st century will yield a West whose public policies equal the quality of its scenery.  For once, I am not keeping my hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P>

<P>	Beneath Greater Yellowstone, powerful thermal energies relentlessly shift tectonic plates.  The subsurface motion creates rifts and faults, occasionally volcanoes and earthquakes.  The fundamental tensions are always there.</P>

<P>	The tectonic plates of culture and political economy are also shifting and generating profound tensions in the new American West.  In Oregon and Idaho, hi-tech industries now provide more jobs than wood products industries.  In Washington, 4,900 lost timber jobs were replaced by three times as many software jobs.  As standing trees become more valuable than logs, it is apparent that values are evolving. Different cultures, polities, and economies collide, occasionally with catastrophic results.  The Yellowstone wolf reintroduction illustrates these changes.</P>

<P>	The wolf is mediagenic, an icon of the changing West.  But icons have varying interpretations.  Those insulated from rural traditions see the wolves as displaced natives who must be returned to the ecosystem. The wolf icon combines their romantic vision of an untamed past with a feel-good mission to set things right.  Conversely, many native Westerners view wolf reintroduction as the imposition of an alien culture that threatens ranching and the traditional economy.</P>

<P>	These traditional interests prompted the National Park Service to exterminate the wolf from Yellowstone in the 1920s.  Now, another federal agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is charged with undoing that misguided &quot;progress&quot;.  However, the imported wolves don't easily coexist with local ranchers and hunters.</P>

<P>	Montanan Chad McKittrick, an unemployed carpenter, just received a six-month sentence in the slammer for killing &quot;Alpha One&quot;, a reintroduced wolf.  The U.S. Magistrate called the shooting, &quot;an intentional, thrill-seeking act in direct violation of the law.&quot;  McKittrick boasted a T-shirt saying &quot;Northern Rockies Wolf Reduction Project&quot;.  In the battle over the wolf icon, some locals in Montana made McKittrick a hero.</P>

<P>	When Park Rangers exterminated wolves Yellowstone lost a key component of its ecosystem.  Since then our ecological knowledge and sensitivity have increased while ranchers' economic and social influence have waned.  New people and interests are colonizing the West.   Nike, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard are moving in.</P>

<P>	Loggers, farmers, fishermen, and miners feel their industries wither.  8,000 logging jobs are expected to disappear from the region in the next two years.  Despite this, the Pacific Northwest has led the nation in new job creation based on a diversifying economy and high quality of life.  In many National Forests, standing trees have greater value than decked logs.  Progressive-era bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Park Service, however, are caught on the fault line between amenity and commodity interests.  Federal agencies cannot manage to the mounting tensions.</P>

<P>	In Oregon, environmentalists chain themselves to trees to stop logging.  But loggers, whose wages have fallen 22% since 1978, miss that income.  In Nevada, a state comprised of 87% federal lands, counties are suing feds for control.  In Idaho, militia concoct conspiracy theories linking federal agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife Service with the U.N. and a New World Order.  </P>

<P>	Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho describes the friction between the traditional West and &quot;a government-sponsored religion&quot; based upon &quot;New Age mysticism, Native American folklore, and primitive Earth worship.&quot;  She sees an invaded West, where &quot;Easterners dream of preserving it, but in the process they're driving our people off the land.&quot;  The Yellowstone wolf symbolizes this conflict.</P>

<P>	Elsewhere, wolves are quietly and naturally recolonizing their former ranges in the Glacier National Park region of Montana.  The Glacier wolf has rapidly proliferated.  Why don't Glacier's wolves attract the same attention, debate, and tension as Yellowstone's?</P>

<P>	The difference between Yellowstone and Glacier is one of means.  The wolves naturally recolonized Glacier, following their food source.  Cut-over forests with booming deer populations are excellent wolf habitat.  These wolves have learned to survive near man.  The wolves that kill livestock are shot.  Vigilant ranchers with rifles provide an evolutionary filter which selects out wolves that won't adapt to man, the supreme predator.</P>

<P>	In contrast, the Yellowstone wolves were caught in the wild, caged, drugged, and then airlifted into the Park.  Federal &quot;caretakers&quot; short circuited the adaptive process.  The transplanted wolves lacked the &quot;training&quot; to coexist with ranchers.  They're not passed through the filters of accommodation with people.  Predictably, Yellowstone wolves are more troublesome than those in Glacier.  The Yellowstone reintroduction may still succeed, but it will be costly in terms of dead wolves, dead livestock, taxpayer money, and cultural conflict between new and old interests.</P>

<P>	The cultural tectonic plates have shifted from 70 years ago when Westerners demanded wolf extermination and the government complied.  Old, native values are undergoing a process geologists call &quot;subduction&quot;.  As one tectonic plate submerges below another, it quietly heats up and eventually returns to the surface through volcanic eruption.  If we are not careful, the &quot;subducted&quot; traditional political economy might one day erupt as it did with Chad McKittrick.  The consequences preclude a harmonious West.</P>

<P>	Long ago, Progressives believed that federal government would foster community harmony.  Instead, it has fueled passions and amplified conflicts near Yellowstone.  And if we're not careful, rare bumper-stickers like &quot;Wolves: Gut Shoot 'Em At The Border!&quot;  and &quot;Hungry And Out Of Work?  Eat An Environmentalist&quot; will become as common as gun racks. </P>

<P>&quot;<EM>Don't Gore us with new taxes</EM>&quot;, picketters in Miami shouted last week.  They opposed Vice President Gore's plan to &quot;tax&quot; the sugar industry in Florida.  A sugar &quot;tax&quot; would be used by the federal government to purchase Everglades land for ecosystem restoration.  In addition to the penny-per-pound &quot;tax&quot;, Gore announced a $1.5 billion environmental cleanup initiative for the Everglades.</P>

<P>	The Everglades ecosystem is clearly degrading.  Environmentalists accuse the sugar industry of despoiling the Everglades.  Economists such as Jonathan Tolman of the libertarian <A HREF="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> counter that government subsidies have encouraged the destruction.</P>

<P>   	Predictably, environmentalists demand a higher tax, and sugar growers want lower taxes.  The debate misses the mark entirely, because the &quot;penny-per-pound tax&quot; is no &quot;tax&quot;.  It is a subsidy reduction.  Gore's plan reduces federal price supports by a penny per pound.  Over $250 million in sugar industry subsidies and an import quota on sugar cost consumers over $1.4 billion a year and harm the Everglades.  </P>

<P>	Subsidies foster destructive agriculture in the Everglades.  Such subsidized destruction of environmental quality is the norm, not an isolated exception.  But politicians of both parties remain blind to opportunities to link fiscal responsibility with ecological integrity.  They and their constituencies have a parasitic relation to taxpayers.  Recipients of wealth transferred from others think they have a right to handouts.  This exemplifies a disturbing trend in American political culture: the conversion of subsidies into entitlements.</P>

<P>	Robert Samuelson of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> describes this in his new book, <CITE>The Good Life and Its Discontents:  The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement</CITE>.  He describes the conflicting and paradoxical nature of entitlements--the notion that we are all entitled to progress and prosperity which government can provide.  The mirage of entitlements, he rightly concludes, shakes the very foundation of American culture.  The problem with entitlements, aside from their conflict with the American ideal of individual responsibility, is the logical consequences of assuming that government can and should provide.</P>

<P>	Should government guarantee us income security and high-quality health care?  If it does, and then what?  What are the predictable consequences of such entitlements?  Entitlements require that government take citizens' scarce resources and distribute them to various interests.  Once government allocates any valuable resource, corruption of purpose must follow.  Here's why: 	</P>

<P>We can never precisely specify what the bureaucrat must do. Some discretion must remain.  And that discretion will normally reflect a political calculus.  The decision maker has incentives to make those determinations that advantage himself, those he favors, and his cause.  <A HREF="gopher://gopher.npr.org:70/11/NPR_Online">National Public Radio</A> programming provides an excellent example.</P>

<P>	When spending the money of others, discretionary power corrupts.  We then see resources going to corporate welfare projects like Senator Bob Dole's ethanol subsidies for Archer Daniels Midland and to the Clintons' friends who wanted to handle travel arrangements for the White House press corps.  With a constituency in place, &quot;subsidies&quot; harden into &quot;entitlements&quot;.</P>

<P>	In the booming postwar years, Samuelson reports, Americans began &quot;to take propserity for granted.&quot;  Times have changed, but our expectations haven't.  We still demand our Social Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing.  These goals necessarily imply trade-offs among competing demands.  The 'right' to farm subsidized sugar comes at the expense of taxpayers and intact ecosystems.  Potential entitlements are endless, but resources are finite.  It's morally and intellectually irresponsible to ignore this reality.</P>

<P>	A century ago, the Progressives did just that.  They claimed that government can and should not only monitor, but also manage resources and provide material benefits.  They and their modern liberal followers believe that social problems can be fixed if only the &quot;right&quot; people were making the decisions.  They thought more discretion by the right bureaucrats will ensure good policy that advances the public interest.  This counsel of perfection was grossly naive.</P>

<P>	America's Founders knew better.  They believed mankind is not perfectible, but rather self-interested.  Therefore they designed institutions to prevent people from harnessing government as an engine of plunder.  They chose a constitutional, limited government with strong checks and balances.  The rights they &quot;entitled&quot; Americans to are found in the Bill of Rights -- mainly freedom from abuse of government power.</P>

<P>	Federal budget deficits, national debt, and actuarial deficits symbolize our Age of Entitlement.  This simply cannot continue indefinitely.  Samuelson suggests we return to the Founders' vision of a limited government that only makes promises it can keep.  Otherwise we'll crash on a runaway system that favors the election of opportunistic, short-sighted politicians with extraordinary abilities to lie in a convincing manner.  All competitive systems favor certain talents.  Political systems that run on claims to welfare favor the best liars.  </P>

<P>	When we consider reform in this Age of Entitlement, remember a constant of political economy: in all systems at all times, wealth and political power go together.  Expanding government entitlements ultimately hurts the poor and debases the moral quality of politicians.  In an Age of Entitlement, civic virtue is an endangered attribute. </P>

<P> 	Public policy failures can take their toll on economic efficiency, ecological integrity, and even human lives.  These failures are endemic to fisheries commons the world over.  Recent issues of Field and Stream, Scientific American, and National Geographic all featured stories about the dire straits of our fisheries.</P>

<P>	Now the Bering Sea brings tragic news of a third outcome of poor policy: dead fishermen. The seven crewmembers of the Seattle-based Pacesetter were safety conscious.  They fell victim to callous policies which unnecessarily endanger lives of fishermen.  The Alaskan crab fishery's open-access nature encourages a mad scramble for catches in excess of sustainable yield.  The scramble is &quot;mad&quot; not only because it's exceedingly dangerous but because society is left worse off whether the risky fishermen succeed or fail.  The system rewards overfishing, and it biases how and when to fish - even if fishermen die in the attempt. </P>

<P>	Peaceful government policies kill people all the time (e.g. CAFE standards which trade blood for oil).  Seldom are they so obvious and direct as in the fishery.  When lost lives are compounded with squandered resources and fears of a global fishery crash, even politicians might place public interest above parochial advantage.</P>

<P>	The tragedy of the fisheries commons became apparent after the 1960s, when world fish stocks collapsed under increasing fishing pressure.  Reform proposals include banishing foreign fishing fleets, quotas, requiring primitive fishing techniques, and satellite surveillance.  By examining the successes and failures of various efforts, we see what makes institutions succeed or fail.</P>

<P>	They usually fail for one reason:  appropriate responsibility for conservation lies not with beneficiaries -- fishery communities.</P>

<P>	There are many examples of bureaucrats regulating from afar, legislators ruling from on high, and monitors watching from a distance.  Remote institutions neglect local conditions.  When central planners set rules, quotas, and limits, alien practices trump local traditions and customs.  </P>

<P>	Distant legislators, central planners, and bureaucrats rarely manage effectively.  Regulations have adverse consequences, quotas lead to waste, and limits are broken.  Policing and sanctioning of fishermen by outsiders is often misguided or absent.  Low-cost means of monitoring and resolving conflicts can't be provided by underfunded state policemen and international courts.  Local fishermen too easily subvert regulations, and foreigners make off with whatever fish they can while filling the coffers afar.  Alien systems generally fail.</P>

<P>	But some got it right.  In Alanya, Turkey, a fishing village evolved an ingenious solution to their fishery in jeopardy of overfishing.  By drawing lots for fishing locations at the beginning of each season, and then rotating to a new position each day, the number of fishermen in each spot is controlled.  If anyone crosses into another's site, the fisherman there will certainly notice and has incentive to report it.  No outside enforcer is required.  Every fisherman's vested interest in their 'spot of the day' provides incentives to monitor.  Limited entry and effective enforcement are low cost, stable, and local.</P>

<P>	In the Philippines, reef fishermen using explosives and cyanide to capture exotic fish have sewn the seeds of the ecosystem's destruction by both overfishing and killing the coral reef.  Establishing offshore marine sanctuaries, where explosives and cyanide are prohibited, has reversed the tide.  Fishermen are behaving responsibly, and empty nets are starting to fill.  Illegal night fishing by foreign fleets jeopardizes the rebounding fish sanctuaries.  Local communities' authority to protect their resources must carry force and respect. </P>

<P>	Managers of the South Pacific fisheries are widely credited with success.  Vast ocean stretches are dotted with tiny island nations whose national incomes are dwarfed by the foreign companies fishing their waters.  But those nations, against the odds, have formed an institution from the ground up.  They implemented an integrated and coordinated management approach and avoided overcapitalization, wasteful regulation, and international conflict.</P>

<P>	These cases provide valuable lessons.  The stories of communities in Turkey, the Philippines, and the South Pacific, teach us that those with long-term vested interests in fishery viability usually act responsibly.  People with a stake in the future, won't act like there's no tomorrow.  In contrast, open-access fisheries invite disruptive outsiders with little incentive for sustainable behavior.  That is why enduring institutions tend to flow from the community level.  Fishing villages recognize the importance of preserving this resource.  Their very livelihoods depend on it.</P>

<P>	Successful reform links the economic health of the fishermen and managers with the biological health of the fishery.  The fishermen and the fish both lose out if decisions about when, where, and how to fish are made by those not held accountable.  Fishermen know more about local conditions and have stronger incentives to improve them.  Bureaucrats and politicians don't benefit from a healthy fishery the way a fishing community does.  </P>

<P>	We can apply the important lessons of successful institutions to prevent future tragedies.  Reforms can't bring back the Pacesetter.  But their sacrifice might motivate responsible reform.  This would be a great tribute to good men lost.</P>

<P>	The epicenter of Ecotopia lies somewhere in the area encircled by Bellingham, Eugene, and Bozeman.  Four colleges of forestry, dozens of environmental groups, and busloads of environmental writers are based there.  Hence, the federal land management agencies are under intense scrutiny.  But even here, the institutional arrangements are so perverse that often management is grossly pathological, ecologically insensitive and economically wasteful   Many analysts now question the justification for federal management of commercial timber land.</P>

<P> 	The woeful performance of agencies like the Forest Service is not due to incompetent or evil people within those bureaucracies.  Rather, bad institutions generate incentives and information which lead smart, well-intentioned people to do harmful things.  The real need is for better economic and legal arrangements, not better people.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service came from progressive era fantasies a century ago.  In <CITE>Public Lands and Private Rights</CITE>, Robert Nelson of the University of Maryland describes the progressive's religion.  Their philosophy requires centralized management by scientifically trained professionals.  They believed that good management can only come from the government, from trained professionals in the Forest Service.  In their view the private sector was incapable of responsible forest management.  Increasingly, evidence mounts that the progressives had it exactly backwards.</P>

<P> 	Professor Nelson points out that, despite this conviction, &quot;the history of the public lands is filled with laws that had lofty purposes and achieve dismal results&quot;.  Bureaucratic politics trumps ecology, economics, and ethics.  Recent events in our Ecotopia illustrate the general problem. </P>

<P> 	275 acres of scorched or burned trees were sold in a remote pocket of the Thunder Mountains in the Okanogan National Forest, Washington.  The salvage logging rider to the 1995 Recissions Bill keeps the public from appeal the timber sale.  Politics exempted salvage sales from environmental regulations.  Logging this area imperils rare lynx habitat and salmon runs.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service spent over $200,000 to plan the Thunder Mountain timber sale.  Its first offering in October yielded no bids from industry.  The Forest Service re-offered that sale two months later, after lowering environmental standards.  This time Omak Wood Products, Vaagen Brothers, and Acord placed bids.  However, they were outbid by the <A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~nwea">Northwest Ecosystem Alliance</A> (NWEA), an environmental group.  Their $29,000 bid marks the first time an environmental group has outbid timber companies for logging rights.  This is a milestone in the co-evolution of environmentalism and economics.  </P>

<P> 	The USFS is likely to reject NWEA's high bid because they vow to let the trees stand.According to Mitch Friedman, NWEA's Executive Director, &quot;The best result for all concerned would be for the Forest Service to take our money.... and allow us to protect the trees for the length of a rotation - maybe 100 years.&quot;  Unfortunately, federal regulations mandate that purchasers be &quot;responsible for&quot; cutting the trees.  The Forest Service says it will disqualify purchasers who lack such &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot;.</P>

<P> 	Throughout time and across cultures, wealth, education, and environmental concerns are positively correlated.  As education and prosperity levels rise, so do environmental sensitivities and interests.  But environmental amenities have long been thought of as luxury goods.  Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service chief, argued with John Muir that material considerations must trump all others.  The national forests were to be federally run as an efficient and responsible business.  </P>

<P> 	While resource extraction drove the American West's economy in 1897, diverse environmental values are helping drive the &quot;new&quot; West's emerging economy in 1997.  Recreation, biodiversity and scenic vistas, along with traditional commodities, represent vital economic resources.  Wildlands surrounding cities contribute to the high quality of life and attract businesses to Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies communities.  And, contrary to expectations of progressive era zealots, private timberland owners have proven far more efficient, innovative, and progressive than federal agencies.</P>

<P> 	Here's how the amenity economy evolves.  Public, non-governmental entrepreneurs identify the interests of those valuing the non-commodity features of forests.  But when environmental entrepreneurs aggregate these interests, they are often stymied by the bureaucratic politics of federal caretakers.  NWEA's high bid on Forest Service lands exemplifies this.  Professor Nelson, a U.S. Department of Interior economist for over 20 years, finds that, &quot;it is most of all the old scientific management theories of the progressive era that stand as a barrier to the development of new institutions for the public lands&quot;. </P>

<P> 	The Forest Service effectively blocks the evolutionary path of the forest economy.  The centralized planning imposed last century has failed to keep pace with the success of private forestry and with the complex and changing values of our modern economy.  Politics and the budgetary process systematically reward federal 'scientific managers' for losing money on environmentally destructive activities.  The Thunder Mountain salvage sale will cost the U.S. Treasury at least $171,000.  The costs of environmental amelioration will follow.  And the non-financial costs to lynx, salmon, lovers of these natural systems, and fiscal conservatives will be even higher.</P>

<P>	As we approach the centennial of the national forest system, it's time to ask if the federal government should even be involved in managing commercial timber.  Central planning fails in the Forest Service as it did in the Soviet Union.  It's time for second thoughts about sylvan socialism.</P>

<P>	The feuding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hooters chain of restaurants results from government overstepping its bounds.  Government has made &quot;Hooters&quot; a household name by stimulating confrontations between market forces and those who abhor sexism and their allies in the Nanny State.</P>

<P>	People become hot and bothered over Hooters simply because &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; leave so little to the imagination.  Thus, the EEOC has targeted them.  The very thought that a business could provide an opportunity for waitresses to serve Buffalo wings with a side order of sex appeal infuriates the P.C. crowd at the EEOC.  How can the politically incorrect restaurant that provides &quot;Bunnies for Bubbas&quot; be allowed to operate?  The EEOC's calling is to bring enlightened social engineering to the masses.  Hooters' success demands their special attention.</P>

<P>	And that's precisely what happened.  No disgruntled male job applicant filed a grievance prior to the controversy.  But Hooters' very existence irritates 'Nanny State' regulators at the EEOC.  So the EEOC initiated its own three-year investigation.</P>

<P>	At an Indianapolis Hooters, for example, waitresses routinely earn from $425 to $600 for their 20-hour work week.  And in the last three years, this Hooters has tossed out a total of five people for offensive language.  And once, only once, a man inappropriately touched a Hooters Girl and spent two weeks in jail for assault.  Look, enjoy, but behave yourself.  The system seems to work.</P>

<P>	The Reno Hooters provides another excellent example.  This restaurant is a bastion of conservatism in a city ruled by casinos, showgirls, and genuinely scantily-clad cocktail waitresses.  But the EEOC is scrutinizing Hooters, not Caesar's Palace.  This is because the law recognizes that some positions are intrinsically gender-biased.  Cowgirls and showgirls are girls, Lady Macbeth is a lady, and women's restroom attendants are women.</P>

<P>	But Hooters Girls can be boys, according to EEOC investigators.  They concluded that Hooters is just a restaurant.  In their estimation, men can fill a Hooters' tank top and serve appetizers just as well as women.  Hence, the EEOC fines Hooters $22 million, mandates that 40% of Hooters Girls be men, and demands that Hooters provide scholarships and sensitivity training to benefit men.  What country are we living in? </P>

<P>	Some people support the EEOC's ruling, some would leaveHooters alone, and others would simply wipe Hooters and its 13,000 employees off the map for its insult to politically correct sensitivities.  Ironically, regardless of one's feelings about Hooters, the EEOC is doing a great disservice to everyone.  Here's how.</P>

<P>	EEOC rulings penalize Hooters.  Hooters responds by rejecting the EEOC determination that they are merely a restaurant.  Hooters asserts, and is prepared to vigorously defend, that their primary mission is &quot;providing vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;  The EEOC transforms the food and drink into side dishes.  The Hooters Girls must be the main attraction.  Only then can Hooters justify its hiring practice.</P>

<P>	That's Hooters' escape route.  When the EEOC forbids Hooters Girls from using sex appeal to sell food, then Hooters must prove that they are using sex appeal to sell sex.  The EEOC transforms Hooters from a gimmicky restaurant into a flesh-peddling bar.  The law protects the hiring practice of strip clubs, and Hooters can find sanctuary in that status.</P>

<P>	Thus, as usual, the Nanny State's efforts backfire.  Shielding the prudes and politically correct who cannot tolerate establishments like Hooters pushes Hooters even farther down a scurrilous path that further debases America. </P>

<P>	It is a familiar and predictable result.  Prohibiting some behavior causes perverse and unintended outcomes.  Coercing Hooters to fall into line with the Nanny State's singular vision of how to serve beer will do two things: (1) rob a great many people of benefits as employees, managers, and customers of Hooters; and (2) force Hooters to make selling sex its first priority.  </P>

<P>	The EEOC and the Nanny State would do well to learn an important lesson from the queen of all nannies, Mary Poppins, who sang, &quot;Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot;  Incentives make the unpalatable palatable.  This is how Hooters uses Hooter Girls to make their burgers and wings appetizing.  In the restaurant business, as in the environmental business, market forces encourage entrepreneurs to innovate enterprises that meet the market test.  Whereas coercion is counterproductive, we should recognize that market incentives often provide the best means to coordinate social actions.  Even when we find the result distasteful, the result is usually preferable to coercion.</P>

<P>	The fundamental problem with prohibiting Hooters Girls is that people want them and other people want to become them.  The managers support them.  The clientele rewards them with their hard-earned money.  And the Girls clearly prefer this work to other work.  With such powerful advantages, Hooters won't swallow the EEOC's 'medicine' without a fight.  By defying these incentives, the EEOC's command-and-control approach yields harmful and perverse results.  This is evidenced by Hooters' newfound emphasis on &quot;vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;</P>

<P>	Hooters maintains 175 restaurants in 38 states and is growing.  It is no wonder that the EEOC, an artifact of the Nanny State, cannot stand to see success based on individual liberty and sexist behavior.</P>

<P>    Here's a benchmark to evaluate environmental policy: economic security and environmental protection go together. Conversely, when environmental policies thwart material wants, green goals languish.  Only when environmental policies foster economic security and productivity can we reasonably expect long term protection.  This understanding helps us protect environmental values.</P>

<P> Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Garrett Hardins' &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; are bench marks of environmental history.  Both works were in process for years, noted only by a few professionals and by a elite audience.  In October of 1993 a new benchmark of environmental thinking was established at Airlie House, a conference center near Washington D.C.  Under the auspices of the Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation, a group of 60 people from 20 countries met to reconsider environmentalism.  The group included anthropologists, field biologists, tribal leaders and donors.  </P>

<P> Their thinking is summarized in a brief, attractive booklet, The View from Airlie House.   They concluded that despite elaborate efforts, the conventional approach to conservation wasn't working.  One critical reason is strategic:  </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The chief strategy of conservationists for more than a century has been exclusionary and implicitly misanthropic....establish protected areas  ...and then safeguarding these areas by carefully limiting human use....The methods of this strategy have been proscription and enforcement--laws and penalties, wardens and guns, in some cases fences and gates....Biological diversity can't be preserved...by setting it aside within protected areas.
&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The participants identified five flaws in this approach.  First is the problem inherent to &quot;island ecology&quot;.  Small protected areas lose diversity over time.  Second, this protected area strategy is too costly and scattered to protect the world's biologically rich landscapes.  Third, governments lack the means to protect borders of sanctuaries.  Fourth, &quot;The protected-area approach, dependent on centralized power and top-down planning, has often robbed rural communities of their traditional user-rights over forests, waters, fisheries, and wildlife, without offering appropriate remuneration.&quot;  Hence, local people see conservation efforts as anti-development and anti-people.  </P>

<P> Finally, this strategy amplifies conflict.  &quot;Blockading rural people against the use of their own landscape without offering them viable alternatives will always, to the blockaded, seem perverse and intolerable.  And will always, consequently be futile.&quot;  Although the focus at Airlie House was upon the Third World, this is also a good but incomplete explanation of the origins of the Wise Use Movement in the American West.  The institutions that yield anti-protection sentiments throughout the Third World operate in the rural areas of the US and Canada.</P>

<P> The approach developed at Airlie is based on a series of case studies from around the world.  It features positive local participation, not proscription and enforcement alone.  It seeks ways to make local communities the beneficiaries and custodians of conservation efforts.  The phrase &quot;community-based conservation&quot; captures the essence of their approach.  </P>

<P> Earlier conservation efforts to protect public goods were based on exclusion and enforcement.  This approach isn't viable over the long term.  Communal use rights and systems of tenure are ignored.  Resources go to the politically favored.  This is the prevailing outcome when ever politicians can buy favor by granting access to natural resources.  </P>

<P> What's true in America is even stronger in third world nations.  Absence secure tenure, rural communities lack standing in decision making.  As a result, they lack incentives to manage for sustainability.  Their incentives are to consider short term interests and immediate gain.  Over the long term, environmental protection is impossible with out recognition of property rights and markets.  </P>

<P> It will be difficult for many greens, however sincere or intelligent,  to accept the View from Airlie, i.e., the positive linkage between use by local people and the  protection of biodiversity.  In today's environmental culture economy and ecology don't often mix.  The Foundation for Deep Ecology wants us to ignore the laws of economics.  Unfortunately for them, economic behavior seems &quot;hard wired&quot;  into our nature by the evolutionary process.  </P>

<P> But fortunately, well off, well educated people normally consider environmental quality an essential goal for a responsible culture.  According to Evert Ladd of the American Enterprise Institute, nearly three quarters of American voters consider themselves environmentalists. </P>

<P> Politicians who ignore this pervasive pro environmental feeling are in peril.  Voters did not reject environmental goals in the 1994 election.  Rather they found  repugnant the statist, bureaucratic, command-and-control means to green ends exemplified by the EPA's approach to wetlands and its management of Super Fund sites.  </P>

<P> Free market and free trade advocates are also challenged by the View from Airlie.  Strong local communities are often eroded by international trade.  Local markets involve personal relations and feelings.  Can they be protected from the relentless workings of the market process at the international level?  It's not clear that the answer is yes.  The drive toward bottom line efficiency usually erodes traditions--including the sense of place so critical to preservation.</P>

<P> The View from Airlie offers an innovative perspective on effective and viable protection of ecological values.  This is progress.  We've tried command and control and found it wanting.  It's time for community-based conservation and for rethinking environmentalism.  </P>

The tragedy of the commons develops in this way. Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. Finally, however, comes the day of reckoning, that is, the day when the long-desired goal of social stability becomes a reality. At this point, the inherent logic of the commons remorselessly generates tragedy.
<P>
As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he asks. "What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?" This utility has one negative and one positive component.
<OL>
<LI>The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the herdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the positive utility is nearly + 1.
<P>
<LI>The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by one more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the herdsman, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only a fraction of -1.</OL>
<P>
Adding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another. . . .  But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit-in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.
<P>
Some would say that this is a platitude. Would that it were! In a sense, it was learned thousands of years ago, but natural selection favors the forces of psychological denial.<A HREF="#8">8</A> The individual benefits as an individual from his ability to deny the truth even though society as a whole, of which he is a part, suffers. Education can counteract the natural tendency to do the wrong thing, but the inexorable succession of generations requires that the basis for this knowledge be constantly refreshed.
<P>
A simple incident that occurred a few years ago in Leominster, Massachusetts, shows how perishable the knowledge is. During the Christmas shopping season the parking meters downtown were covered with plastic bags that bore tags reading: "Do not open until after Christmas. Free parking courtesy of the mayor and city council." In other words, facing the prospect of an increased demand for already scarce space, the city fathers reinstituted the system of the commons. (Cynically, we suspect that they gained more votes than they lost by this retrogressive act.)
<P>
In an approximate way, the logic of the commons has been understood for a long time, perhaps since the discovery of agriculture or the invention of private property in real estate. But it is understood mostly only in special cases which are not sufficiently generalized. Even at this late date, cattlemen leasing national land on the Western ranges demonstrate no more than an ambivalent understanding, in constantly pressuring federal authorities to increase the head count to the point where overgrazing produces erosion and weeddominance. Likewise, the oceans of the world continue to suffer from the survival of the philosophy of the commons. Maritime nations still respond automatically to the shibboleth of the "freedom of the seas." Professing to believe in the "inexhaustible resources of the oceans," they bring species after species of fish and whales closer to extinction.<A HREF="#9">9</A>
<P>
The National Parks present another instance of the working out of the tragedy of the commons. At present, they are open to all, without limit. The parks themselves are limited in extent--there is only one Yosemite Valley-- whereas population seems to grow without limit. The values that visitors seek in the parks are steadily eroded. Plainly, we must soon cease to treat the parks as commons or they will be of no value to anyone.
<P>
What shall we do? We have several options. We might sell them off as private property. We might keep them as public property, but allocate the right to enter them. The allocation might be on the basis of wealth. by the use of an auction system. It might be on the basis of merit, as defined by some agreed-upon standards. It might be by lottery. Or it might be on a firstcome, first-served basis, administered to long queues. These, I think, are all objectionable. But we must choose--or acquiesce in the destruction of the commons that we call our National Parks.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4  COLOR = "#006699" ><I><B>Pollution</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT=3>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=6 WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=151 SRC="OldMill.gif">In a reverse way, the tragedy of the commons reappears in problems of pollution. Here it is not a question of taking something out of the commons, but of putting something in--sewage, or chemical, radioactive, and heat wastes into water; noxious and dangerous fumes into the air; and distracting and unpleasant advertising signs into the line of sight. The calculations of utility are much the same as before. The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them. Since this is true for everyone, we are locked into a system of "fouling our own nest," so long as we behave only as independent, rational, free-enterprisers.

The tragedy of the commons as a food basket is averted by private property, or something formally like it. But the air and waters surrounding us cannot readily be fenced, and so the tragedy of the commons as a cesspool must be prevented by different means, by coercive laws or taxing devices that make it cheaper for the polluter to treat his pollutants than to discharge them untreated. We have not progressed as far with the solution of this problem as we have with the first. Indeed, our particular concept of private property, which deters us from exhausting the positive resources of the earth favors pollution. The owner of a factory on the bank of a stream--whose property extends to the middle of the stream--often has difficulty seeing why it is not his natural right to muddy the waters flowing past his door. The law, always behind the times, requires elaborate stitching and fitting to adapt it to this newly perceived aspect of the commons.

The pollution problem is a consequence of population. It did not much matter how a lonely American frontiersman disposed of his waste. "Flowing water purifies itself every ten miles," my grandfather used to say, and the myth was near enough to the truth when he was a boy, for there were not too many people. But as population became denser, the natural chemical and biological recycling processes became overloaded, calling for a redefinition of property rights.

<FONT COLOR = "#006699"   SIZE=4><I><B>Mutual Coercion Mutually Agreed Upon</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The social arrangements that produce responsibility are arrangements that create coercion, of some sort. Consider bank robbing. The man who takes money from a bank acts as if the bank were a commons. How do we prevent such action? Certainly not by trying to control his behavior solely by a verbal appeal to his sense of responsibility. Rather than rely on propaganda we follow Frankel's lead and insist that a bank is not a commons; we seek the definite social arrangements that will keep it from becoming a commons. That we thereby infringe on the freedom of wouldbe robbers we neither deny nor regret.
<P>
The morality of bank robbing is particularly easy to understand because we accept complete prohibition of this activity. We are willing to say "Thou shalt not rob banks," without providing for exceptions. But temperance also can be created by coercion. Taxing is a good coercive device. To keep downtown shoppers temperate in their use of parking space we introduce parking meters for short periods, and traffic fines for longer ones. We need not actually forbid a citizen to park as long as he wants to; we need merely make it increasingly expensive for him to do so. Not prohibition, but carefully biased options are what we offer him. A Madison Avenue man might call this persuasion; I prefer the greater candor of the word coercion.
<P>
Coercion is a dirty word to most liberals now, but it need not forever be so. As with the fourletter words, its dirtiness can be cleansed away by exposure to the light, by saying it over and over without apology or embarrassment. To many, the word coercion implies arbitrary decisions of distant and irresponsible bureaucrats; but this is not a necessary part of its meaning. The only kind of coercion I recommend is mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected.
<P>
To say that we mutually agree to coercion is not to say that we are required to enjoy it, or even to pretend we enjoy it. Who enjoys taxes? We all grumble about them. But we accept compulsory taxes because we recognize that voluntary taxes would favor the conscienceless. We institute and (grumblingly) support taxes and other coercive devices to escape the horror of the commons.
<P>
An alternative to the commons need not be perfectly just to be preferable. With real estate and other material goods, the alternative we have chosen is the institution of private property coupled with legal inheritance. Is this system perfectly just? As a genetically trained biologist I deny that it is. It seems to me that, if there are to be differences in individual inheritance, legal possession should be perfectly correlated with biological inheritance--that those who are biologically more fit to be the custodians of property and power should legally inherit more. But genetic recombination continually makes a mockery of the doctrine of "like father, like son" implicit in our laws of legal inheritance. An idiot can inherit millions, and a trust fund can keep his estate intact. We must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust--but we put up with it because we are not convinced, at the moment, that anyone has invented a better system. The alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate. Injustice is preferable to total ruin.
<P>
It is one of the peculiarities of the warfare between reform and the status quo that it is thoughtlessly governed by a double standard. Whenever a reform measure is proposed it is often defeated when its opponents triumphantly discover a flaw in it. As Kingsley Davis has pointed out,<A HREF="#21">21</A>  worshipers of the status quo sometimes imply that no reform is possible without unanimous agreement, an implication contrary to historical fact. As nearly as I can make out, automatic rejection of proposed reforms is based on one of two unconscious assumptions: (1) that the status quo is perfect; or (2) that the choice we face is between reform and no action; if the proposed reform is imperfect, we presumably should take no action at all, while we wait for a perfect proposal.
<P>
But we can never do nothing. That which we have done for thousands of years is also action. It also produces evils. Once we are aware that the status quo is action, we can then compare its discoverable advantages and disadvantages with the predicted advantages and disadvantages of the proposed reform, discounting as best we can for our lack of experience. On the basis of such a comparison, we can make a rational decision which will not involve the unworkable assumption that only perfect systems are tolerable.
<P>
<FONT COLOR = "#006699" SIZE=4><I><B>Recognition of Necessity</B></I></FONT>
<P>
.....<BR>
First we abandoned the commons in food gathering, enclosing farm land and restricting pastures and hunting and fishing areas. These restrictions are still not complete throughout the world.

Somewhat later we saw that the commons as a place for waste disposal would also have to be abandoned. Restrictions on the disposal of domestic sewage are widely accepted in the Western world; we are still struggling to close the commons to pollution by automobiles, factories, insecticide sprayers, fertilizing operations, and atomic energy installations.

In a still more embryonic state is our recognition of the evils of the commons in matters of pleasure. There is almost no restriction on the propagation of sound waves in the public medium. The shopping public is assaulted with mindless music, without its consent. Our government has paid out billions of dollars to create a supersonic transport which would disturb 50,000 people for every one person whisked from coast to coast 3 hours faster. Advertisers muddy the airwaves of radio and television and pollute the view of travelers. We are a long way from outlawing the commons in matters of pleasure. Is this because our Puritan inheritance makes us view pleasure as something of a sin, and pain (that is, the pollution of advertising) as the sign of virtue?

Every new enclosure of the commons involves the infringement of somebody's personal liberty. Infringements made in the distant past are accepted because no contemporary complains of a loss. It is the newly proposed infringements that we vigorously oppose; cries of "rights" and "freedom" fill the air. But what does "freedom" mean? When men mutually agreed to pass laws against robbing, mankind became more free, not less so. Individuals locked into the logic of the commons are free only to bring on universal ruin; once they see the necessity of mutual coercion, they become free to pursue other goals. I believe it was Hegel who said, "Freedom is the recognition of necessity."<BR>

<H3>Theoretical Foundations:  Market Failure and the Environment</H3>
<P>Systematic analysis of environmental problems must begin with the theory of market failure. Market economies generally do a good job serving the needs of consumers. Why, then, should the market fail to provide environmental am enities--from clean air and water to nature preserves and wildlife conservation--that many consumers clearly desire? This ostensible inability of the market to provide certain goods and services has been labeled by economists "market failure."
<p>
What are the fundamental causes of market failure? Two qualities of goods and services have been recognized as contributors to market failure: nonexcludability and nonrivalrous consumption. Nonexcludability means that the seller of a good unable to prevent nonpayers from consuming the good (or that is inefficient to do so because the marginal cost of exclusion exceeds the marginal benefit).  National defense, for instance, is nonexcludable good: once the good is produced, the seller is unable to exclude those who refuse to contribute to the good's reduction. Nonrivalrous consumption means that the marginal cost of a seller providing the good to an additional customer is zero; that is, any number of consumers may enjoy a good characterized by nonrivalrous consumption without detracting from the enjoyment of others. One good that has this quality is a movie theater: any number of patrons may enjoy a movie (up to the theater's capacity) without detracting from the enjoyment of other viewers and without imposing any additional costs upon the owner.
<p>


<Font Size =3 COLOR = "#003366" >
<center><img VSPACE= 12  WIDTH=442 HEIGHT=199 src= "Chart.gif" ALT="Chart"></center>
These two qualities can be used to construct a chart that gives a taxonomy of market failure. (See above figure.) This chart has four components. First, there are goods, called "private goods," that display neither of the two qualities. These goods do not contribute to market failure. Second, there are goods, which we may label "public goods," that are characterized by nonrivalrous consumption alone. A private movie theater would be a useful example of a public good, because the owner can exclude those who refuse to pay, but an additional patron's consumption imposes no costs on others. Third, there are goods, named "commons," that display nonexcludability but whose consumption is rivalrous. The living room of a student apartment is a good example of a commons: no one living in the apartment can be prevented from using it, but its use by one individual does often detract from the enjoyment of other users. Finally, there are those goods, which we may label "collective goods," that have both qualities. Again, national defense is the paradigmatic example: one can't exclude nonpayers from enjoying the benefits of national defense, and one person's consumption doesn't detract from the consumption of others.
<p>
Why do collective goods, public goods, and commons pose a problem for the marketplace? Commons and collective goods are both characterized by nonexcludability. Nonexcludability leads to a difficulty known as the "free-rider problem." Certain individuals may benefit from a good without paying to support the good's production; they are called "freeriders.' In the commons, such freeriding may lead to an inefficient exploitation of the commons resource; because nobody has the power to exclude, the commons will be used without regard for the costs imposed. This problem is typically referred to as "The Tragedy of the Commons". The problem has been known for centuries and was dealt with by great thinkers from Aristotle to David Hume.
<p>
This problem is especially noteworthy in such commons as the atmosphere. Arthur Pigou used the example of atmospheric pollution to illustrate his wellknown distinction between social and private costs. Pigou argued that because industrial polluters did not take into account the costs their pollution imposed on neighboring landowners, pollution would be produced at an inefficiently high level. By taking the pollution of factories into account through imposition of effluent charges, the private costs of production could be brought in line with the true, social costs of production, and pollution would fall to an efficient level.
<P>
Another area in which market-oriented solutions to environmental problems have been used is pollution abatement. Privatizing the commons has been tried with excellent results in at least one instance: British streams. In Britain, the right to fish a particular part of a lake or stream is a private property right that can be bought, sold, and traded. This propertyrights structure has not only prevented overfishing but has also kept British streams remarkably clean: owners of fishing rights take polluters who damage their fishing grounds to court--and the owners consistently win.
<p>
<H3>Conclusion:</H3>
The theoretical and practical aspects of FME. though substantial, need to be further researched and developed. The theories of market failure, governmental failure, and environmental economics need to be more solidly unified than they are now. Although this effort at unification has to some extent been attempted, no one has yet unified them in a way that fully takes account of property rights and their use in solving environmental problems. For instance, how can migratory herds be privatized? What contractual methods can be used to provide environmental amenities on a large scale? On a more practical level, further research needs to be done into the implications of FME in the real world. And finally, are there some environmental problems (e.g., nonpoint toxic discharges) that are simply not amenable to a market solution? (Even if this were true, of course, it does not detract from the superiority of private property solutions for other environmental problems.)

<Font Size =3  COLOR = "#003366" >[W]hether or not politicians comprehend or care about the particularities of the mountain, or the savanna, or the lowland rainforest, they make decisions and set policies affecting those ecosystems and the human communities within them.  It isn't entirely illogical that they should, since rural communities by their nature are small, whereas ecosystems by their nature are extensive, and the consequences of resource depletion or ecological degradation extend far beyond the boundaries of any given community. Deforestation in a highland drainage could deprive farmers downstream of perennial water supplies, or destroy a subsistence fishery with siltation. A single community along the migratory route of the Serengeti wildebeests could exterminate the herds and preempt the livelihoods of thousands of Tanzanians and Kenyans involved in the tourism industry. Western and Wright had made these points in their introductory paper. They had also recognized that the strong trend toward centralized national authority, characteristic of most countries during the modern era, has tended to subvert the traditional, local systems of communal authority. Increasing urbanization during recent decades has exacerbated the problem, since rural communities generally lack the political potency of urban populations when it comes to influencing national policies. The imbalance is aggravated further when rural areas hold commodity resources such as minerals, oil, or timber that offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich. What's the remedy for this tension between national and local concerns?  "Should a government abrogate its broader responsibility in the process of devolving proprietary rights to local communities?" asked Western and Wright. The Airlie participants had grappled with that riddle too.

No global assessments of the success of state-owned parks and protected areas exist.  The Nature Conservancy's assessments of parks in Latin American found that the ecological integrity of many of the parks surveyed was at risk.  An informal survey of knowledgeable field biologists from Latin America, Africa, and Asia yielded the uniform opinion that states everywhere are failing to carry out their full responsibilities to manage biodiversity and in fact may be contributing to its destruction.  The status of the world's "public" forest reserves is better studies; rapid deforestation of these forests has been recognized as a global crisis.
<p>
Conservation failures under strong public tenure are, in part, the result of factors noted in Neotropical Forests and Policy: government's tendency to support economic development, its lack of sensitivity to socioeconomic needs and conservation interests, and its lack of resources to monitor resource conditions.  In addition, many case studies (see Niger, Amboseli, India) cite widespread evidence to conclude that strong public tenure has failed to support conservation because states have followed colonial patterns of mining natural resources for quick capital to maintain state coffers and the political status of its elites.
<p>
Negative impacts on biodiversity have paralleled the erosion of traditional community-based tenurial rights that occur as states impose "public" rights.  The most well-documented causal links between loss of tenurial security and biodiversity loss come out of studies seeking the causes behind the loss of the world's tropical forests.
<p>
States historically have assumed rights over forests, particularly for revenue generation; these include rights to decide harvest schedules, royalties, who can harvest (timber permits), export tax, and rights to nontimber forest products, etc.  (see India, Annapurna).  In this process, states generally have ignored customary property rights.  In India, for example, the state incrementally overcame local resistance and community-level assertions of rights to manage forests by slowly shifting from granting communities fores "rights" to restricting communities to more limited "usufruct (use) rights" and "privileges," and finally to denying all rights to forest products and other privileges altogether.  Local communities fought to retain forest management rights, but over several decades, the state eliminated all community-level tenurial security.
<p>
Historical records show that India's forests were biologically rich, despite being used by high populations of people and livestock for thousands of years prior to central control under British colonization.  Tribal authorities, local elites, and princes enforced strict local forest management rules through methods including taxes, fines, land-use zoning, required labor commitments, and community forest guards.  The British ignored these local institutions and transformed community-managed forests into state forests that became de facto open-access areas.  Now, after the forest and their biodiversity have become severely degraded, various Indian states are granting certain tenurial rights to local communities in recognition of strong empirical evidence that  communites can effectively manage and, in this case, regenerate their own forests (see India).
<p>
<img align=left Hspace=10 Vspace=16  WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=236 src= "TropicalTree.gif">This degradation of biodiversity under public control is not limited to forests.  That inappropriate management and ignorance of traditional regimes have contributed to the degradation of grasslands and wildlife in Africa is widely accepted (see Amboseli, CAMPFIRE).  Establishment of parks and wildlife reserves sometimes has led to degradation or destruction of biodiveristy by people who view the park as territory taken from the by outsiders for outsiders' benefit.  Likewise, numerous cases in which traditional communities have attemtpted to defend their fishing territories against outside fishing interests are well documented in Oceania and other coastal zones throughout the world.  The resulting degradation of fisheries has been especially well documented in India but applies globally.
<p>
By insisting that biologically rich lands are owned by the state (under public tenure), national government often create conditions of "open access."  Garrett Hardin's (1968) "<A HREF="TragedyCommons.html">The Tragedy of the Commons</A>" was actually about the tragedy of open accesss, a situation that is promoted when community-based tenure is weakened, biodiversity if often pillaged in a wide-open race for short-term gain.  In effect, public land, or other public resources, belong to no one in particular but to everyone in general.  This ambiguous official status acts as a magnet that pulls charcoal makers, loggers, landless farmers, and other short-term users onto "public" forest land.
<p>
In practice, however, access generally is not equally open to all when profits can be made from exploiting public resources.  Many nation-states grant legal privileges either to favored elites (e.g., logging concession holders, plantation developers) or to troublesome "excess" populations of the landless rural poor through planned or incentive-assisted resettlement schemes.  As an example of such political use of public resources, in many countries, land tenure laws reward new settlers with titles if they "improve" land by clearing it of trees (see Boscosa).  In a twist of the usual story, an indigenous Sarawak community made the hard choice to cut down their forest when the state designated it as a public forest reserve.  If they had tried to fight the reserve, arguing that the forest was theirs, the community would have lost its village lands as well as the right to harvest the forest.  On the other hand, migrants following logging roads would have been permitted to cut down the trees with the legal protection of the government and granted title to the same land.  By cutting down all the trees, the existing community was able to secure tenure to the land, since village lands are deemed "agricultural land" once they are cleared.  The village paid a small fine and then planted rubber trees.
<p>
When communities traditionally have manged resource sustainably, government claims may destroy any incentive to continue to do so.  Without official recognition, communities do not have access to the formal legal structure to exclude those who encroach on their rights and overexploit their resources, be they local elites, multinational corporations, or landless migrants.  Lacking legal recognition, indigenous peoples and migrants living on "public" lands can not legally benefit from exploitation of the local natural resources base.  Deprived of the legal means and incentives to exclude newcomers and manage the forest for long-term sustainable benefit to themselves, many communities become increasingly responsive to market pressures to overexploit and join in the free-for-all.
<p>
In the case of wildlife, public management is often nonexistent, although most states claim the right to regulate hunting.  As noted in Amazon and CAMPFIRE, local communities tend to carry out wildlife management in rural areas more effectively than government authorities.
<p>
In summation, rational human beings face disincentives to make long-term improvements and take short-term losses to sustainbly manage their local resource base when they lack assurance that they and their successors will continue to profit from their investments.  The growing clamor for tenurial security by rural people around the world demonstrates the importance of this assurance.  Simply stated, tenurial security is an important precondition for sustainable resource management, principally because it encourages long-term planning and greater investments of labor and resources.  In the words of Harvard economist Theodore Panayotou,
<blockquote>Property rights need to be secure.  If there is a challenge to ownership, risk of appropriation (without adequate compensation), or extreme political or economic uncertainty, well-defined and exclusive property rights provide little security for long-term investment such as land improvements, tree planting, and resource conservation. (1989)</blockquote>

The Glenfeshie estate, which consists of 42,000 acres of Cairngorm wilderness, may be about to become the latest and largest victim of an intriguing new trend: the collectivisation of land ownership. Until now, most land in this country has belonged to individuals. But it is collective owners -- the Government, quangos, pension funds, conservation bodies and companies -- that are the future of land ownership. The day of the individual landowner is passing.
<p>	The owner of Glenfeshie, a fitted-kitchen entrepreneur who bought the estate in 1988 for more than 2.5 million, is selling because, rumour has it, he is fed up with trying to run an estate overrun with hikers and semi-official busybodies. What's the point, he must have wondered, in owning the land when other people tell him what he can and cannot do? The favourite candidate to buy the estate is the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
<p>	But even if a private millionaire does buy it, his hands will be tied. Last month there was a revealing letter in <CITE>The Scotsman</CITE> from Michael Scott of 'Plantlife', who said:
<blockquote>
'A potential purchaser of the estate might expect for 4-5 million to buy the unfettered right to own and manage the land, but that is far from the case . . . He will need extremely broad shoulders because there will be very many people looking over them. I trust the selling agents will make this clear to potential purchasers.'</blockquote>
<p>
<img align=right Vspace=5  Hspace=12  WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=186 src="PastoralWCastle.gif">Translated, this means, 'Let's try to talk down the price so a conservation organisation can buy it'. But what Mr Scott said is absolutely true. Ownership of land no longer means what it used to. When you buy land you acquire rights that have been greatly restricted and circumscribed. If there are buildings, the planners decide what may be done with them down to the last window sash. If there are woods, the Forestry Commission and the planners dictate whether you may fell them and how you must replant them. If there are fields, the Ministry of Agriculture tells you how many of them you may plant each year. If there is a bog, English Nature or its Scottish or Welsh equivalent will designate it as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and give you your orders; if a river bank, expect a call from the National Rivers Authority. There is now no kind of land - except a back garden - that you may do what you like to without permission from a bureaucrat. Only the costs and taxes of ownership are still yours in full.
<p>	But, aside from this creeping confiscation of ownership rights by the national government, there has been a steady expansion of collective forms of land ownership: that is, land owned by a corporate, public or voluntary body. The National Trust, the RSPB, the British Rail Pension Fund, farming companies, the Forestry Commission, the Ministry of Defence, local authorities - these are all the great modern landlords, vastly greater than all the dukes and earls put together. I would guess that more than half the land in this country is now in such collective hands. They have one huge advantage: they never pay inheritance tax.
<p>	There is nothing automatically wrong with collective landowners. Many are excellent stewards of the land, just as many individual landowners are incompetent, absentee and thoughtless. The RSPB in particular is an attentive and responsible steward of its reserves. Indeed, what is happening is probably just part of an historical trend, as, a century ago, privately owned firms mostly gave way to limitedliability public companies.
<p>	But, as with public companies, something valuable is lost. There is a loss of accountability (try finding out who to blame if something goes wrong), a loss of local control (collective landowners usually take decisions in distant London committee rooms, whereas not all millionaires are absentee), a loss of eccentricity (who ever heard of the National Trust commissioning a folly?), and a loss of continuity (wardens and executives move on or retire after a few years; earls do not).
<p>	Many Scotsmen resent the way their mountains became private playthings of the rich in Victorian times. But they should be wary of leaping out of that frying pan into a nationalised fire.

A quick glance at today's news reveals the conflict and controversy over the economics and ecosystems of fisheries.  The challenge is to find the best system for achieving two seemingly contradictory goals:   the simultaneous exploitation and preservation of the fishery.  Solutions require understanding <A HREF="#item2">externalities</A> and <A HREF="#item1">entrepreneurs.</A> 


<p>
Optimizing the harvest of fish stocks while maintaining their viability is not easy. The very nature of fisheries makes optimizing difficult.  Fish, unlike agricultural products, are mobile and hidden resources of the sea.  These conditions make oceanic fisheries a nearly perfect example of a 'commons'.  <A HREF="#item3">Commons</A> are characterized by (1) potentially depletable resources are (2) open to all.  The buffalo of the early American West provide a popular <A HREF="#item4">example.</A>
<p>
Fisheries, like all commons, are subject to the forces which lead to the "tragedy of the commons". The tragedy occurs when all individuals race to exploit the resource while neglecting the adverse effects to society.  Like polluters, fishermen are encouraged to fish as much as they can because the penalties of overfishing are shared among all society.  When social and legal arrangements give incentives to overfish the commons, fishermen will do so.  This is the tragedy.
<p>
When the private costs of fishing are much lower than the social costs, an externality is present in the economy of the fishery.  Externalities, like air pollution, are the product of a system which permits fishermen private benefits while making society pay the costs. 
<p>
A simple example of this can be seen in the case of the North Pacific fur seal. Until 1890, the fur seals were harvested in a regulated, sustainable manner. Then, changes in technology and the market price of fur seals made high-seas harvesting of the fur seals possible and cost-effective. The fur seal fishery was not managed on the high seas. Not surprisingly within 20 years, the population of fur seals fell to one-tenth its previous level.
<p>
It was entrepreneurial spirit that exposed the powerful externalities in the fur seal economy.  The freedom offered by unregulated fisheries permitted entrepreneurs wide berth in their efforts to create value.  In a commons characterized by an imbalance between private and social costs, such innovations can damage society.  Entrepreneurial innovation made it valuable to increase seal harvests even after its population has been decimated.  In this way, entrepreneurs can speed up the process of overfishing (just like some inventions have introduced more efficient ways to pollute).
<p>
Off the Pacific coast, one can find an example of the tragedies occurring in fisheries throughout the world.  The widow rockfish became overfished between 1979 and 1981, despite a 70% drop in its market price during that time.  Why?  By chance, an Oregon fisherman discovered that widow rockfish concentrate in a single area at night.  This discovery led to phenomenal increases in catches.  Entrepreneurship invented a great deal of value from the fishery where there previously was little.  The tragedy manifested after 1982 as declining productivity in the fishery, higher long-term costs for rockfish, and scores of vessels with nothing to catch.
<p>
There are many ways to avoid these 'tragedies'.  The root of the problems lies in the synergy created by externalities and the commons.  In the commons, fishermen impose great costs on society, and it often costs too much to stop them.  A solution lies in establishing a system that either discourages or prohibits fishermen from imposing such high costs.  Making the fish private property discourages fishermen from using the fish in manner costly to society.  Because privatizing fish is inherently problematic, fisheries managers have turned their attention to regulating access.  Regulating access to the fishery can place limits on externalities fishermen can create.
<p>
In the struggle to strike a balance between preserving a resource and exploiting it, we've seen some successes.  After depleting the North Pacific fur seal population, the United States and other nations established ownership of the fur seals.  Social costs and harvesting costs became one in the same, removing externalities.  The fur seals have made a remarkable recovery, and profits have increased under this regime.
<p>
Regulating the commons usually means placing it under government control.  Beware, though, for this alone is not enough.  The widow rockfish were under U.S. jurisdiction, and catastrophe still happened.  The system, be it private property or a moratorium on fishing, must be wary of the nature of fisheries. 
<p>
Externalities should be minimized.  In such a system, entrepreneurial fishermen will find ways to increase the productivity of the fishery.  And in such a system, society as a whole will benefit. These effects normally follow private property and free market processes.  They are very rare in fisheries, but not impossible. 
<p>
Herein lies a real entrepreneurial challenge:  find a way to minimize externalities and thereby create value for individuals and society.  This way, entrepreneurship works on two levels.  While technological entrepreneurs create valuable enterprises and innovations, public policy entrepreneurs can improve our institutional arrangements to harmonize individual pursuits with greater welfare.  We need the foresight to encourage both sorts of entrepreneurship.

<H4>GLOSSARY</H4>
<p>
<H5><A NAME="item1">Entrepreneurs:</A> </H5>
  Entrepreneurs are those individuals who create wealth by exploiting market imperfections and taking risks in innovative enterprises.  They catalyze technological invention, improved business practices, and more effective institutional design.  Entrepreneurs make the dynamic adaptation and adjustment of market economies possible.  Entrepreneurs exercise their judgment and ingenuity to fill market niches and exploit new opportunities.  Entrepreneurs are a fundamental force in the economy, both in spite of and because of their highly variable and unpredictable nature.
<p>
<H5><A NAME="item2">Externalities:</A> </H5>
 When voluntary, individual actions impose adverse consequences for others, this is considered an "externality".  They are termed so because these actions take place outside of the institution of voluntary exchange, where we usually expect that trade-offs and compensation are made.  When a landowner charges a fee for other ranchers to graze their flock on their land, we expect that each party (landowner and rancher) will be relatively satisfied so long as both enter the agreement voluntarily.  Conversely, when there is no negotiated trade-off or exchange, individual actions quite likely impose costs on others while providing benefits to the actor.  Those externalized costs are known as "externalities".  When ranchers can freely graze their livestock on land owned as a commons, they'll individually reap the benefits of fatted calves while everyone feels the externality of a destroyed grazing commons.

<H5><A NAME="item3">Commons:</A> </H5>
  See the <A HREF="EconomicsEcologyExchange.html">Robert Taylor</A> piece for further description of a commons.  In short, all commons are relatively open-access, meaning anyone in a group can freely exploit that resource without needing permission, having a quota, or other limits.  Also, commons are "subtractable".  The more an individual exploits a commons, the less there is of it for others to exploit.

<H5><A NAME="item4">Buffalo commons:</A> </H5>
   <blockquote> The Plains Indians very eagerly accepted modern technology in the form of horses, guns, and steel tools....  By 1840 the Indian had driven the buffalo from portions of the Great Plains area and there is evidence of concern about this problem.  E. F. Murphy states that "[o]nly the simplicity of weaponry and the small numbers of these nomadic peoples kept the buffalo from meeting its fate two centuries sooner."....  
	[T]he buffalo were driven close to the point of no return.  Given multiple tribes and the fact of no real cooperation, the Indians were incapable of managing the buffalo as a common pool resource....  The benefits from harvesting one more buffalo accrue to the individual hunter, while the costs of depletion of the herd are spread among all hunters.  The true costs of hunting are not borne by the hunter and over-use is predictable.</blockquote>

Baden</P><P>TOMORROW is the Seattle meeting of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. According to their news release, the council's goal is to: &quot;explore and develop policies that encourage economic growth, job creation, and effective use of our natural resources.&quot; Council leaders want to learn what works in environmentally sound economic-development policies.</P><P>       The council includes prominent environmental officials from the Clinton administration such as Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, EPA Administrator Carol Browner and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. They know that Al Gore is emerging as the most influential vice president in our history, a leader with genuine responsibility for establishing and guiding policy in several areas, especially environmental policy. With the Clintons preoccupied by health care, foreign affairs and recurrent allegations of scandal, Gore's importance will grow. We may see a Gore presidency in the year 2000 or before.</P><P>     How might a Gore presidency affect America's natural resource and environmental policies? Will his policies work? For starters, Gore seems to care a great deal about our environment. He correctly identifies many serious problems - species extinction, population pressures, aquifer depletion - in his book, &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;.</P><P>     Unfortunately, although he gets many facts straight, his proposed reforms are likely to be genuinely harmful; he has learned little from history. Gore sees the problem as evil and ignorant people and insufficient government management. His approach to environmental bliss is naive - place good, intelligent people in positions of authority and empower them to pursue rational, publicly beneficial policies. He assumes that political bureaucracies can consistently promote environmental ends. While this may work at the community level, it normally fails at the national level as both ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency are trumped by politics.</P><P>     Gore's policy inclinations are right in the trivial sense that many environmental problems could easily be dealt with if we could &quot;rewire&quot; people and produce a new environmental man. This creature would enthusiastically support programs that improved the quality of the environment, even if they implied significant personal costs. Environmental man's self interest is subservient to ecology. But this is as unrealistic as the Soviet's efforts to create a &quot;new socialist man,&quot; another altruistic creature. And like the Soviet's efforts, rewiring - or in this case repainting people a new shade of green - will fail, causing much environmental mischief and fostering political opportunism.</P><P>     The key to environmental protection is not reliance upon more extensive political micromanagement. Neither is it dependence upon good people in high places or mass conversion to a more ecologically responsible perspective. True, my fellow conservationists and I would rest easier if we could count upon having people such as Aldo Leopold, a profound social observer and a founder of wildlife science, as Interior Secretary. And yes, I'd be delighted if voters shared my views and joined in mass support of The Nature Conservancy and Ducks Unlimited.</P><P>     But in reality, no society has learned how to identify Platonic despots, i.e., people who will wisely and disinterestedly safeguard the public good. Likewise, mass political movements that inspire sacrifice and achieve sustained, dedicated support normally generate horrid results. Castro, Franco, Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin are but extreme examples of the corruption inherent to centralized power.</P><P>     The temptations to abuse power are enormous in environmental policy and elsewhere. If we accept Gore's approach, with its heavy reliance on good intentions, good people and strong government, we invite abuses. Good people will not always be in top positions and ordinary people will not always act in environmentally beneficial ways. As America's founders clearly explained, government power is likely to be misdirected. Political management and ecological sustainability are not complementary for several reasons.</P><P>     The most important reason is that a politician must capture campaign contributions to survive. This means he typically must favor his constituents over the national interest. The greater the government's role in the economy, the more costly it is to neglect one's voters in favor of the public interest in the environment.</P><P>     We can learn this lesson from federal agencies such as the Forest Service (1897), Bureau of Reclamation (1902) and Park Service (1906). The creators of these agencies, the first Progressives, expected good people to use scientific principles to publicly manage natural resources. But as the power of these agencies grew, so did the subsidized abuse to Western environments and citizens. Gore seems not to understand that these earlier efforts failed because their incentives were perverse and the information they generated was of poor quality.</P><P>     Gore has taken the important first step of recognizing our environmental ills. But like the progressive reformers of a century ago, he has misdiagnosed the causes and hence the cures. A few in the Clinton administration, including Browner but excluding Babbitt, seem to understand the importance of property rights and incentives to a greener future. I'm afraid that if Gore doesn't learn these lessons and we follow his lead, we will have the worst of all worlds: ineffective environmental protection, inefficient economics and a citizenry disenchanted with environmental causes. The trick is to harmonize economics with ecology. Unfortunately, Gore hasn't learned it.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

Baden</P><P>I'VE sent my check to the Salvation Army for the relief of California's earthquake victims (Salvation Army, Earthquake Fund, 615 Slaters Lane, P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313). People are in genuine distress and there is clearly a need for outside help. But I've also written letters to my congressional representatives, urging them to not provide federal aid for long-term relief. This is because I firmly believe long-term federal aid does more harm than good.</P><P>       In the last century, when we were much poorer and more vulnerable, efforts to dispense federal disaster aid met fierce resistance. For example, the Texas Seed Bill of 1887, a measure to distribute $10,000 to help farmers in drought-stricken Texas, was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. Why veto so small a sum for so good a cause? Cleveland justified his action stating: &quot;A prevalent tendency to disregard the (government's) limited mission  . . . should be steadfastly resisted to (enforce the lesson) that, though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people.&quot; Cleveland was being compassionate, not cruel, and his advice remains sound today. He understood the slippery slope of political aid.</P><P>     Providing voluntary aid to one's fellow citizens is admirable, and emergency federal assistance (e.g., tents, food and water, and National Guard troops) for areas struck by major natural disasters is justified. Such aid serves a humanitarian purpose in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. It is cruel to apply narrowly economic criteria during this period. But it is vital that economic incentives play a major role during the recovery. Long-term federal aid that reduces the costs of rebuilding or repairing homes and other property is a subsidy. Like most subsidies, it distorts useful economic incentives and has perverse consequences.</P><P>     The problem is twofold. First, when people do not bear the consequences of their actions they are encouraged to build and live in places prone to disasters, e.g., flood plains and earthquake zones. Second, the availability of federal aid encourages officials to grant disaster aid to areas that lack genuine need. We have seen raids on the Treasury grow ever larger as people come to expect federal bailouts.</P><P>     The first problem is easy to understand. It is an example of what economists call &quot;moral hazard.&quot; When people are not responsible for the full costs of their actions, they behave in riskier (i.e., potentially more costly) ways. Thus, rental cars are often abused because the people who rent them never directly pay for the wear and tear they inflict on transmissions or brakes. Very similar are people who build on earthquake faults, flood plains or barrier islands if they receive insurance that subsidizes the cost of repairing damaged homes, cars and so forth. They take fewer precautions, precautions that may extend to not living, or building expensive structures, in disaster-prone locations.</P><P>     The moral question to ask is not whether people who are suffering should be helped, but what incentives are we creating for future behavior? If the government encourages unsafe construction practices and locations via subsidies, the human and material costs of disasters will only grow larger than otherwise. This includes significant environmental costs because many disaster-prone locations have substantial biological or aesthetic value. In effect, by helping victims now, we create many more victims, human and ecological, later.</P><P>     The second consideration is equally important. It may have been President Cleveland's main concern. As long as federal disaster subsidies remain, politicians will have significant incentives to acquire those monies, even if they have not suffered anything remotely approximating a disaster. The prospect of receiving federal aid may have prompted Montana's governor to declare a state of emergency following the eruption of Mount St. Helens (May 18, 1980), even though the post-eruption situation in Montana was far from disastrous.</P><P>     When aid is available, opportunism can color decisions. President Clinton had incentives to move quickly to disburse emergency aid in part because of California's importance to his re-election and to the 1994 congressional races. Making federal aid available during real disasters generates pleas for such aid when more local and perhaps private efforts would suffice. Eventually, disaster aid disproportionately goes to the politically shrewd or powerful. Moreover, the generosity of federal aid programs rachets upward while non-federal matching proportions slide.</P><P>     Even when raw political considerations are not paramount, the question remains: Where do we draw the line? When do disasters merit federal subsidies? Clear distinctions are impossible and the mindset &quot;they got theirs and I should get mine&quot; dominates since relative need or merit cannot be exactly determined.</P><P>     Direct federal costs grow, politicians feed on federal monies, and worst of all, the impulse toward private giving is eroded. The loss of such civic virtue is of vital concern, but is exceedingly difficult to measure. Its presence builds bonds of fellowship among Americans.</P><P>     We should feel compassion for the quake victims. But let us not pursue policies that foster worse situations in the future. It is tempting to open the federal purse. But we should do so with great reluctance, realizing that some consequences are quite negative. President Cleveland got it right: the government should not support the people. It is indeed a slippery slope.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

For example, giving people orders seems cheaper than creating positive incentives for them to cooperate, especially if the order limits what people can do rather than taking physical possession of their property. But we should be extremely careful because over the long run, &quot;takings&quot; are expensive. At a minimum, they erode faith in government's most important role: the fair protector of social life.</P><P>     Most people agree that forests are environmentally and economically important. This is why there are strong pressures to impose regulations preserving watersheds, ecosystems, biodiversity and other forest values. But these restrictions do not come free. They may be worth the price they exact but we should recognize that they impose substantial costs upon owners, society and even ecosystems. As John Muir taught us more than a century ago, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     In the Douglas fir region of the Northwest a landowner typically invests $300 to $500 per acre preparing the soil, planting it and tending the seedlings until they are established. This investment generates nothing until the first commercial thinning perhaps 25 to 35 years later. In Western Washington a landowner would normally have the final cut 50 to 75 years after planting. Some owners prefer older stands and keep timber standing long after it is economically mature.</P><P>     Restrictive regulations, or the mere prospect of such regulations, reduce or eliminate the owner's future security. Without the certainty that they can harvest their trees a generation or two later, or sell to someone who can, landowners have weaker incentives to be good stewards. Trees are likely to be cut prematurely and the land converted to non-forestry use. This is happening throughout the Northwest today.</P><P>     Throughout the 1980s, small woodlands owners in Washington obtained about 8,000 permits to cut their timber. That rose 50 percent by 1990 and preliminary estimates by the Washington Farm Forestry Association suggest an additional 50 percent increase by 1993. Money and fear, a powerful combination, are two important reasons for this increase.</P><P>     First, let's consider money. Today, owners see extraordinarily high prices for timber from private lands. Concern for the spotted owl dramatically reduced the timber available from federal lands, shifting demand to private and state forests. Until recently, prices in the export market have been high. Finally, low interest rates have substantially increased new home construction and hence demand for forest products. Each factor contributes to higher log prices and stronger incentives to harvest timber.</P><P>     Fear is also important, particularly the fear that if timber is not sold now, it will be impossible to sell later. This fear seems justified to many people who were counting on their timber as an investment, perhaps for retirement. There are many horror stories in the media and far more floating around rural cafes of people whose &quot;nest egg&quot; has been cracked by restrictive regulations. This gives landowners very strong incentives to cut while they still can.</P><P>     Likewise, if timber mills fear that logs won't be available later, their buildings and equipment will decline in value and may become essentially worthless. They have incentives to run as long as they cover their out-of-pocket costs and just a smidgen more and wear out their capital. This fear causes them to buy logs at higher prices than could be sustained over the long run.</P><P>     Forestry is quite different when people are secure in their holdings. Most important, people secure in their rights can prudently look ahead 35 to 60 years. When their rights to harvest in the future are secure, there are many things that landowners will often do to increase yields. For example, people can plant expensive but genetically improved seedlings, and thin, prune and fertilize. These practices can increase productivity per acre over 50 percent. This means fewer acres will be cut.</P><P>     At the minimum, concern over regulatory &quot;takings&quot; causes rational people to dramatically reduce their investment in yield-enhancing efficiency. In addition, when productive forestry practices are reduced on private lands in the United States, more trees will be cut elsewhere. According to U.C. Berkeley forestry professor W.J. Libby, we will lose 49 species for every 25,000 acres of rain forest cut. To the degree that demand is shifted to tropical rain forests, some species will go extinct. Also, as wood supplies are constrained, substitutes with greater environmental impacts will displace wood products, e.g., steel studs in house construction.</P><P>     Actions have consequences, in ecosystems and markets. Regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of private property will encourage behavior that defeats our environmental goals and strengthens opposition to environmental reforms. We should consider the reality of unintended consequences when designing environmental reforms. </P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>PRESIDENT Clinton is desperately looking for places to cut the budget. He even hints of hitting the Rural Electrification Administration. REA is an egregious example of government subsidies that enrich the wealthy while retarding environmentally beneficial innovation.</P><P>       REA was established in 1935 by President Roosevelt. It subsidized the delivery of electric power to remote rural locations at a time when few rural areas were electrified. Because the costs of stringing miles of power lines to isolated customers was so high, and alternative energy just developing, only 10 percent of farms had electricity.</P><P>     Lack of electricity contributed to low rural living standards. With collectivism in vogue, it appeared reasonable for the public to pay for power delivery. Taxpayers were to lose nothing: Federal subsidies were made at interest rates higher than the government's costs of borrowing. However, being a political promise, it was short-lived.</P><P>     Economies are like ecosystems in that you cannot do only one thing. REA had unintended, perverse consequences. Once these consequences are understood, the REA's appeal shrinks. But it has built a constituency and it won't quietly go away.</P><P>     First, few of the REA's subsidies actually benefit poor, rural areas. They did for a while, but do not now. Today, subsidies go to wealthy resort communities such as Vail, Aspen and Beaver Creek, Colo., and Hilton Head, S. C. They also go to wealthy suburbs of Atlanta, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C. Over half the subsidies benefit Fortune 500 companies. The REA is subsidizing skiers, suburbanites, resorts and big businesses with middle-class taxes.</P><P>     Second, the REA loans almost $2 billion annually, and more than 60 percent of these loans will never be repaid because interest rates on the loans are less than the rates the government must pay to borrow money. However, subsidies for the rich and increases in the federal deficit pale in comparison to the third consequence of the REA: nearly 60 years of discouraging research into alternative energies and conservation.</P><P>     The REA subsidized centrally generated power. This created a bias against small-scale alternative energies. Centralized power plants sometimes have cost advantages, what economists call economies of scale. But if delivering this power is expensive, alternative energy sources (e.g. biomass conversions, solar, wind, small-scale hydroelectric, and tidal power) become competitive. Also, people are encouraged to conserve by seeking more-efficient appliances, machinery and tools.</P><P>     The REA eliminated the delivery-cost advantages of alternative energies and discouraged their development. Research into solar and wind power and organic fuels declined sharply after the creation of the REA. Inventors and investors realized that oil, coal, large-scale hydroelectric and eventually nuclear power were favored over small-scale alternatives.</P><P>     For example, Marcellus Jacobs, founder of the once-successful Jacobs Wind Electric Co., states that the spread of REA-subsidized facilities signaled the end of his business. The solar water-heating industry, resurging after World War II, was also stunted by cheap electric rates. Likewise, the ultimate demise of research into tidal power is attributable to the subsidized introduction of cheap electricity.</P><P>     Subsidies usually have negative environmental consequences. In this case, some of the environmental costs are the loss of nearly 60 years of research and development in conservation and alternative energy. In rural areas, the cost of centrally generated power is high. This gave incentive for research and development into small-scale alternative energy and energy conservation. But REA subsidies favored central power.</P><P>     Even when subsidies do some good, such as electrifying rural America, they frequently do great hidden harm. In the case of the REA, the harm is almost 60 years of lost alternative energy research. Subsidized rural electricity has deepened dependence on foreign oil, on dirty coal, on big dams, and on expensive nuclear power.</P><P>     Since alternative futures are unknowable, we cannot know the costs of stifling innovation with subsidies. But we do know there will be costs, and that they are often significant. We know that government subsidies often become twisted to serve the interests of the rich and powerful at the expense of the weak and vulnerable. In the case of the REA, the financial and environmental costs of subsidies have been huge.</P><P>     Government subsidies are dangerous and costly, even when originally intended for good purposes. And once in place, they are very hard to eliminate. Let the public remember this when considering the Clinton administration's new budgets.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>GOLD mining on federal lands, raising sugar cane near the Everglades, and irrigating Western deserts all illustrate the critical differences between being pro-free market and pro-business.</P><P>       It is easy to see why many people confuse the two. Wise Use groups and others, out of duplicity or ignorance, posture as defenders of the free market. But in fact, they often argue for special privileges and protections that cost the environment, consumers and taxpayers dearly. It is important to understand the difference between advocating the free market as a process and advocating special treatment for businesses.</P><P>     The market is a system of information and incentives. It coordinates human action and allocates resources to their highest valued uses with greater efficiency than other systems. It works extremely well, though never perfectly, with commodities such as minerals, agricultural goods and manufactures.</P><P>     However, some valuable things, such as clean air, species diversity, migratory waterfowl, and scenic landscapes are difficult to protect and allocate through the market. Economists call these public goods and common-pool resources. It is difficult or impossible to price or to establish clear property rights over them - and without clear and transferable property rights, the market cannot function well. If markets are to minimize waste and efficiently protect the environment, people must bear the costs of their actions.</P><P>     Businesses are players within the market framework. Each shares the framework with other groups as well as unorganized individuals. Businesses in the market are like organisms in an ecological system.</P><P>     Businesses have incentives to avoid the full costs of their actions. They often favor policies that advantage themselves and impose costs on others. If responsible for their full costs, the things they produce may be more expensive. For example, gold mining, which can involve dynamiting entire mountains and bathing the rubble in poisonous cyanide solutions to leach out the gold, may not be profitable if ecological, aesthetic and health costs are counted. Companies may even have to give up their mines. Society (i.e. all of us) would reap a net gain, but stockholders and employees would suffer losses.</P><P>     A pro-market position puts the public's well-being ahead of special privileges for any business. In contrast, the phrase &quot;pro business&quot; means allowing certain people to evade responsibility for the costs of their actions and to insulate themselves from competition. Many businesses try to avoid or ignore environmental costs because by doing so, they gain in the short run. To avoid costs, businesses lobby legislatures to limit competition, obtain subsidies, or ignore certain costs.</P><P>     Consider Florida sugar growers. U.S. sugar quotas protect them from less-expensive imports. Moreover, sugar growers can ignore the enormous ecological damage they inflict on the Everglades. Their political power (even then-Sen. Al Gore voted to protect them) allows them to retain these subsidies at the financial and environmental expense of the country.</P><P>     But such pro-business strategies always advantage one industry by disadvantaging others. For instance, candy manufacturers who use sugar have higher costs than Canadian competitors because U.S. sugar prices are kept artificially high by quotas. They have been forced to use corn syrup as a higher cost and imperfect substitute for sugar. And now the corn syrup producers lobby to keep the quotas on foreign sugar. In economies as in ecology, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     Or consider the Mining Act of 1872. It grants companies the right to mine federal lands virtually for free. It probably made sense 100 years ago, but today it is an indirect subsidy to environmentally destructive mining. Mining companies favor the law because they don't want to pay market prices for the lands they mine and be responsible for the environmental damage they cause. Again, being pro-market by requiring mining companies to bear these environmental costs would hurt the companies while benefiting the public.</P><P>     Federal subsidies for irrigation are a notorious pro-business strategy. With water delivered at 10 percent of its cost, it is profitable to grow water-intensive crops such as rice in semi-deserts like the Central Valley of California. But the &quot;cheap&quot; water does not reflect the opportunity costs of taxpayers' money, the wildlife habitat and fish runs damaged by dams and water diversions, and the pollution created by chemical runoff from irrigated fields. Subsidized water costs society a great deal. Here again, being pro-market puts us at odds with the private interests of agribusiness.</P><P>     People who take pro-market stands take equally strong stands against special privileges for businesses. Both justice and efficiency demand that businesses bear full responsibility for the costs their actions impose on society, including the environmental costs. Market principles favor the environment because many environmental problems arise when people are isolated from the costs of their actions. This insulation comes from favors for the politically powerful. This is why being pro-market supports the public's interests first and foremost. As environmentalists learn this distinction, I hope to see a union of pro-market and environmental forces.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>Some of the questions raised in this column are addressed in FREE's forthcoming book, &quot;Environmental Gore: A Constructive Response to Earth in the Balance.&quot;</P><P>  THE global warming debate, like many environmental issues, is scientifically complex and highly emotional. Its complexity hinders informed debate and its emotionalism makes consensus elusive. Part of the problem is that climatology (the discipline dealing most directly with global climate issues) is a young and inexact science. But much of the problem can be traced to special interest's manipulation of the political process.</P><P>     Contrary to conventional wisdom, many fundamental questions about global warming remain unanswered. Two crucial questions are: 1) Is significant human-induced global warming actually occurring? 2) If it is occurring, will the net effects be beneficial or harmful? In neither case is the answer an unambiguous &quot;yes.&quot;</P><P>       First, significant global warming may not be occurring. Certainly, the historical relationship between CO and temperature changes is ambiguous. Although levels of atmospheric CO have risen nearly 40 percent since the turn of the century, data from within the United States indicates no statistically significant increase in mean annual temperatures. In fact, between 1920 and 1987, there was a slight cooling trend.</P><P>     Data also indicates that the rise in hemispheric temperature has been significantly less than expected given the increase in CO. And the region most likely to see temperature increases, the Arctic, has actually cooled since about l940.</P><P>     Furthermore, the climate models used to predict warming depend on numerous unknowns. For example, we do not know how changes in cloud cover will affect global temperatures. Although the models agree that a warmer earth is likely to be a cloudier earth, it is unknown whether more clouds will cool the planet by reflecting sunlight or warm the planet by trapping re-radiated heat before it escapes into space. The net effect is unclear. Neither do the models explain the impact of temperature changes on polar ice and snow. A warmer climate may increase precipitation and produce more ice and snow in colder areas. This would increase the earth's albedo and cool the planet.</P><P>     The empirical and theoretical uncertainties surrounding global warming counsel caution before making policy. Scientists are certainly being cautious; a Feb. 13, 1992 Gallup poll shows that most climate scientists doubt there has been any significant human-caused global warming to date.</P><P>     But even if global warming does occur, it is unlikely to be a catastrophe. Robert Balling, director of the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University, and Richard Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at M.I.T., conclude that doubling atmospheric CO is likely to produce an average global temperature increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This, increase is likely to be most significant at night, at high latitudes, and during the winter. It will not melt polar ice caps nor raise sea levels more than a few inches. There will not be super-hurricanes and there will not be endless summers of blazing temperatures.</P><P>     In fact, there are many benefits associated with increased atmospheric CO. Doubling CO levels will favor bigger plants and may increase average crop yields by an estimated 33 percent. More atmospheric CO allows plants to grow using less water by reducing evapotranspiration - water evaporating after it is released from plants' pores. Precipitation and soil moisture may rise, and droughts may become less frequent.</P><P>     Amidst the uncertainties, one thing is certain: Some groups benefit if the public believes global warming is a genuine crisis that can only be stopped with massive political mobilization. Irresponsible efforts by these groups fuel fears of widespread drought and crop failures, of super powerful hurricanes, of oceans engulfing coastal cities, and of blazing summer temperatures. How do they gain by hyping global warming?</P><P>        For environmental groups, global warming is the ultimate issue. It affects everyone, it is dramatic and thus captures the public's attention, and it can only be solved by mobilizing government to impose regulations and develop programs. For those environmentalists hostile toward industrial civilization, global warming provides a rationale to impose their version of ecotopia. The threat of global warming gives license to those who seek to profit from crises.</P><P>     Insurance companies may also gain from government efforts to control global warming. Insurers are motivated more by profits than ideology. If global warming causes increased hurricane damage or floods, they may lose immense amounts of money. Massive carbon taxes or regulation may halt warming and their losses. Since they as taxpayers will pay only a trivial portion of any regulatory bill, it is reasonable for them to seek such measures. If global warming never manifests, they lose little, but society loses a lot.</P><P>     When making decisions and facing uncertainty, responsible people evaluate the most likely costs and benefits of alternative strategies. Given our current understanding, the changes wrought by global warming may well bring small costs or perhaps benefits. Massive prevention programs will surely be expensive, they will slow economic progress worldwide. Moreover, delaying action for a few years, while our understanding of climate change improves, is likely to lead to more prudent policies. If substantial warming is going to occur, a few years delay will make very little difference.</P><P>     The global warming debate is far from settled. In deciding what to do, we should consider both the merits of the arguments and the possibility that they are being manipulated for hidden agendas. If we do not, we are likely to be stampeded into public policies with huge immediate costs and few if any benefits.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I OFTEN defend the habitat of species I care for deeply: grizzly bears, wild trout and birds of all kinds. But, like most people, I care even more about preserving the quality of my own habitat, my neighborhood and community. Within that habitat, we not only worry about pollution and disease, we are concerned with human predators (i.e. criminals).</P><P>       This concern has recently resurfaced in a vigorous debate about the merits of gun control and its impact on crime. Is it wise to support gun control? This is a difficult question, one worthy of careful attention.</P><P>     National Public Radio, The New York Times and The Atlantic Monthly exemplify progressive thinking on many matters of social policy. Hence it is revealing that they have recently featured articles challenging the conventional view that citizens' access to handguns should be severely constrained. In these articles, Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University's School of Law and James Q. Wilson of UCLA argue that this sort of policy is likely to be ineffective and indeed counterproductive.</P><P>     In Polsby and Wilson's view, handguns are tools that give their owners an advantage when bargaining or interacting with others.</P><P>     For example, I am a healthy, athletic, 6-foot, 190-pound male - a difficult mark for an unarmed person. However, if I left my neighborhood cash machine some evening and a 97-pound weakling with an Uzi demanded my money, he would surely get it. The Uzi gives my assailant the upper hand.</P><P>     If guns are tools they are subject to the laws of economics. Using economic logic, we can ask: Who will give up their guns if an aggressive program of handgun control is enacted?</P><P>       People who expect to use guns frequently, such as criminals, find them very valuable. They are unlikely to easily relinquish their guns. People who value guns very little, perhaps professors who live and work in safe neighborhoods, are  most likely to relinquish them. Thus gun control will have the most impact on those least likely to commit crimes. Should gun control succeed, the habitat of once-safe communities will degrade as still more armed criminals confront an increasingly vulnerable (i.e. unarmed) populace.</P><P>     Consider a lesson from the Montana ranch my wife and I own. For many years, we ran sheep on rangeland between our low-lying fields and the higher-elevation timberlands. Although the area is beautiful, it is also burdened with an abundance of predators. We suffered losses from bears, coyotes and an occasional mountain lion. Late summer, when coyote pups learn to hunt, was the worst time. They wounded many sheep while learning to kill. Tending wounded sheep was wrenching and most unpleasant because the cuts are hidden under the wool, where they often become infected and maggot infested. But we felt an obligation to care for and protect them.</P><P>     In the late 1970s we adopted an ancient strategy to defend our stock: guard dogs. Long before the invention of guns, steel traps and poison, Europeans trained guard dogs to stay with livestock to protect it from wolves, bears and human raiders. Though hardly perfect, this strategy works quite well. Guard dogs very rarely kill predators, even when two 100-pound dogs confront a 25-pound coyote and her pups. And because our dogs, a Komondor and a Sharplenenitz, are big and white and look much like sheep from a distance, the predators cannot easily know when the dogs are nearby and when they are not. The dogs raise the cost of predation by &quot;arming&quot; the sheep. They make our stock too risky a target for most coyotes, cougars and bears.</P><P>     An armed household is like a herd of sheep protected by guard dogs. A serious human predator, a career criminal, is reticent about striking a residence if its occupants are likely to be armed. However, if a criminal knows that a house is unarmed, the dangers are less and the pickings are easier. It is as if the sheep have no guard dogs.</P><P>     In the short run, we can do little about the presence of guns in our town, neighborhood or city. About the only thing we can do is make sure that our houses contain no weapons. I am not at all sure that people would disarm themselves if they realized that by going unarmed, and letting everyone know it, they were making life easier for criminals. Yet this is exactly what conventional gun control seeks to do. The consequences are clear if my ranch analogy holds.</P><P>     Ask yourself, would I like to have this sign and display it on my house? If you would, let me know; I would be happy to sell you one and donate the proceeds to charity. But if not, perhaps you agree with the economic argument that guns in the hands of honest citizens raise the costs of crime and make crime less likely.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>1995 will be the silver anniversary of Earth Day. This will be a significant event, for it marks a full generation since we formally recognized our environment's fragility and value. To celebrate the anniversary, I suggest that we begin a campaign to buy Siberia. This would be America's Earth Day present to the world. Buying Siberia was suggested by Walter Mead, a researcher who has traveled in the region and noted the vast scale of environmental destruction caused by insensitive development of natural resources.</P><P>       Earth Day celebrations usually blend pantheism and pontification. There is much blame-fixing, but little careful analysis of the causes of environmental problems. On Earth Day, many greens are carried away by their enthusiasm and identify corporate greed and individualism as our problems. If everyone could purge greed from their hearts, become informed, and commune with earth spirits, all might be well.</P><P>     My approach is quite different. I focus on the critical shortage - lack of good institutional arrangements. If we buy Siberia we can replace its existing institutions, legacies of socialism and corruption, with institutions that harmonize environmental responsibility and economic progress. Like Yellowstone Park, the world's first national park, this can be America's environmental gift to the world.</P><P>     Just as the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, so we could buy Siberia in 1995. We know enough to avoid past mistakes. After the U.S. bought Alaska it made the mistakes common throughout the American West; it gave government bureaucracies and perverse laws control over the land. The results are clear. The Forest Service, Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, and the Mining Law of 1872 fostered abuse of the West's land, water and wildlife.</P><P>     Today, the Forest Service subsidizes destructive logging in the Rocky Mountain states, Park Service mismanagement turns Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks into overgrazed, simplified ecosystems, the Bureau of Reclamation supports dams that lose money and destroy salmon runs, and the Mining Law of 1872 continues the primacy of mining over other values.</P><P>     Siberia resembles the American West of a century ago - a sparsely inhabited, resource-rich frontier. Siberia's 3.5 million-plus square miles are home to fewer than 15 million people and contain enormous reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds and timber. Siberia also houses environmental treasures such as Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world and an ancient ecosystem; diverse taiga forests of cedar, fir, pine and spruce; endangered species like the Siberian tiger, and dozens of free-flowing rivers.</P><P>     Like the American West of the 1800s, Siberia's environment is threatened by reckless economic development. Lake Baikal and the Angara River are dying from pollution, soil erosion is destroying agricultural land, air pollution is poisoning the people, and toxic mining wastes are simply dumped.</P><P>     Russia lacks the technology, expertise and will to protect environmental values. Poverty and hardship encourage extensive logging, mining and drilling with little thought for the long-term consequences. With many resources located in fragile environments, irresponsible development would be disastrous.</P><P>     Recognizing the threat, some environmentalists advocate creating a huge Siberian wilderness area, off-limits to development. Such proposals reflect self-delusion and intellectual naivete. Surging world demand for natural resources and Russians' desire for development make resource development inevitable. The only questions are: at what environmental costs and for whose benefit?</P><P>       Since we could not halt development even if we wanted to, sincere environmentalists have to foster institutions that will ensure ecologically friendly development. Federal management has failed miserably on the public lands of the United States. Responsible management by the nonprofit and for-profit sectors provides the path to responsible greenness. This requires institutions that provide incentives to consider ecology and community as well as economic values.</P><P>     I recommend we create a public, quasi-governmental corporation to purchase Siberia from Russia. The federal government could legitimize the enterprise and perhaps guarantee the bonds used to raise the cash. After an ecological inventory, the corporation would sell some land (with environmental easements and covenants) to companies and private individuals. The rest would be held as a public resource by environmental trusts modeled after the Nature Conservancy, but not managed by politicians or government bureaucrats.</P><P>     Development would be limited in environmentally sensitive areas. There would be no subsidies for economic development or extractive activities. For example, mining rights would not be subsidized as they currently are in the United States by the Mining Law of 1872. Restoration bonds would hold polluters responsible for any environmental damage they cause. This is necessary to constrain industrial emissions and dumps. Development could be prohibited in irreplaceable environmental areas, places like Lake Baikal, an ecological analog to Yellowstone Park.</P><P>     At the same time, environmentally sensitive development efforts would be encouraged, with the developers liable for any damages they cause. This requires clear and enforceable property rights. Finally, land use would be taxed at rates reflecting its actual use, rather than its most financially valuable potential use. This would eliminate the pressures to develop land in order to meet tax obligations.</P><P>     By creating legally enforceable incentives for nongovernmental landowners to responsibly develop Siberian resources we create a situation in which many good things go together: economic progress for local populations, resources for the world, but most important, development with environmental sensitivity. This example could be an Earth Day present for the world.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HARVARD University Press recently published a book on risk regulation written by Stephen Breyer, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Breyer argued that &quot;the resources available to combat health risks are not limitless.&quot; He is exactly right. We maximize health and environmental quality by investing our money and efforts where the payoffs are highest.</P><P>       It makes good sense to prioritize environmental protection. Unfortunately, good sense is conspicuously absent in current efforts to ban the use of chlorine. Greenpeace calls for a &quot;chlorine-free society.&quot; Support also comes from other environmental organizations. George Coling of the Sierra Club states &quot;. . . the debate is no longer whether to phase out these chemicals, but how&quot; and Tim Eder, of the National Wildlife Federation notes, &quot;When it comes to (these chemicals) you don't make them, produce them, or dispose of them . . . you just get rid of them!&quot; We should be wary of their claims, for they suggest political opportunism, not sound science.</P><P>     Greenpeace and its allies argue that chlorine and all organochlorines (i.e. compounds containing chlorine) threaten wildlife and people. They see an outright ban as the quickest and most effective way to improve environmental quality. Further, they claim that a &quot;chlorine-free society&quot; is achievable at modest economic cost. None of these claims are accurate.</P><P>     Their first mistake is failing to distinguish among chlorinated compounds. A rigorous toxicology analysis composed by CanTox, a group of consultants in toxicology, health and environmental sciences, convincingly argues that the mere presence of chlorine does not render a compound carcinogenic. Assuming a substance is harmful merely because it contains chlorine is akin to assuming water is flammable simply because it contains hydrogen, a highly flammable element. Different compounds with the same elements often have very different properties.</P><P>     Clearly, certain chlorinated substances, such as PCBs, DDT and dioxin, do harm wildlife at sufficiently high concentrations. However, PCBs and DDT were banned years ago and today dioxin emissions are kept to virtually undetectable levels. The point is this: Regulations should target specific substances whose environmental harm has been clearly demonstrated through rigorous scientific studies. The ad hoc reasoning used by Greenpeace and others is no substitute for careful risk analysis.</P><P>     In addition, it's hard to tell if a chemical &quot;causes harm.&quot; Harm varies with the extent of exposure and disappears entirely below certain threshold doses. In the Great Lakes, bald eagles, double-crested cormorants and other predator bird populations rebounded as DDT and PCBs were phased out and emission regulations reduced dioxin concentrations. Moreover, at the concentrations typically found in our environment, no organochlorines seem to cause identifiable human health problems.</P><P>     Industrial uses aside, it is worth remembering that until chlorination became widespread, dirty water was the most serious public health problem, spreading cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery. Contaminated water supplies still kill 25,000 children a day in the Third World. The substitutes Greenpeace favors are more costly and much less effective at maintaining water purity.</P><P>     Will chlorine substitutes be safer than chlorine? No one can be certain. But, we have an enormous amount of practical experience using and controlling chlorine - experience that does not exist for many substitutes and cannot exist for many innovations. Past experience indicates that new risks will appear once the substitutes are used regularly. Thus, Greenpeace presents us with a false choice - the danger of chlorines or the safety of substitutes. Chlorines are not nearly as dangerous as they portray and substitutes are unlikely to be as safe as they claim.</P><P>     A chlorine ban also implies substantial economic costs. For example, pulp and paper manufacturers often use chlorine to bleach wood pulp to create high quality paper. Switching to chlorine-free processes (i.e. &quot;totally chlorine-free bleaching&quot;), would require extensive reconstruction of many mills at a cost of roughly $9.4 billion. The switch would cost an additional $2.4 billion per year because chlorine-free production is a less effective and less well-known method of manufacturing. The cost across all industries of a chlorine-free society, given current technology, would approach $91 billion annually.</P><P>     The EPA has proposed a regulation that &quot;only&quot; eliminates the use of elemental chlorine in pulp and paper manufacture. Chlorine compounds such as chlorine dioxide (ClO) are permitted. This is the mildest response we could expect from an agency where politics often trumps science.</P><P>     Ultimately, the effort to ban chlorine is not a simple struggle between greedy industries and good, public-spirited environmentalists. Alleged defenders of the public interest reap money and power by advocating and enforcing regulations. If successful, they often divert time, money and personnel from genuine and important environmental risks. This is the social cost of crisis entrepreneurship.</P><P>     Industrial chemicals are produced for beneficial public purposes, not for corporate whim. Although we should insist that these chemicals be managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we should also be vigilant toward those who amplify and exploit public concerns and reap private gains. No one has a monopoly on virtue or knowledge.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>TWICE I've cried in a movie. The first time I was 4 years old and saw Bambi. The second was in 1970, when I saw a tear-provoking &quot;documentary&quot; of a polar bear hunt.</P><P>       The few polar bears I've seen in the wild inspired awe and admiration. But during this film, a faux-sportsman was flown onto an ice flow where he killed, with a long range shot, a she bear. She had two young cubs who presumably would die of starvation and neglect. This was a repulsive act, one contrived to make sensitive people feel embarrassed to be hunters. It worked for me.</P><P>     People who share my interest and concern have no easy way to channel their feelings into effective action. As Adam Smith explained, when its hard to organize people, many worthwhile things aren't done. That's why we use government to protect endangered species - to reduce the difficulties of achieving group goals.</P><P>     But all institutions have imperfections. For-profit firms discount or ignore values lacking market prices. No-profit organizations have serious problems with recruitment and motivation. And when tasks are given to political organizations, decisions are made by political calculus where ecology, economics and equity are trumped by politics.</P><P>     So we have problems dealing with endangered species, especially those without commercial value. Corporations have weak incentives to preserve their habitat. No-profits find it difficult to mobilize support for species lacking romantic appeal. What about government?</P><P>       Don Coursey, a University of Chicago economist, considered endangered species for a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He identified the key issue: &quot;At a practical level of analysis, the country must decide how much to spend on protecting endangered species and how to distribute this amount among each endangered plant and animal.&quot;</P><P>       He went on to study the actual amount and distribution of spending on endangered species.</P><P>     Coursey observed that expenditures are determined by a competitive, complicated political process.</P><P>     Data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed total state and federal expenditures on 247 endangered species totaled $84,894,000 in 1990. This excludes hidden regulatory costs imposed on people in the private sector.</P><P>     The 20 animals that receive the most attention and money tend to be &quot;charismatic megafauna,&quot; big romantic creatures such as the grizzly bear, woodland caribou, eastern cougar and large birds of prey.</P><P>     In contrast, the bottom 20 are obscure rodents, insects or snails. In a national survey, Coursey found that those animals that are highly rated by the public receive more money - a beauty pageant of endangered species.</P><P>     Professional ecologists and wildlife biologists differ from the general public. They weigh ecosystem balance, interdependencies, and genetic information more heavily and advocate systems that enable every species to exist and adapt.  They want ecological analogs to Noah's Ark.</P><P>     But we can't have it all. Choices will and must be  made. Noah's Ark is on a budget. And when these choices are made in the political arena, it is the public  rather than the scientists' values that drive policy.</P><P>     Popular versus elite preferences is a classic democratic problem. This creates ecological problems when the public's values conflict with the long term health of most species and ecosystems.</P><P>     Even when scientists have their technical facts straight and understand ecological cause and effect, they often exhibit naivete when considering political economy. Many advocate keeping species protection a primarily public enterprise.</P><P>     But as long as it remains with public, political institutions, it is dominated by the general public's  values and superficial understandings. Healthy ecosystems require we shield management from misinformation and ill-informed democratic opinions.</P><P>     Clearly, national and international governments must deal with large scale issues such as atmospheric pollution and migratory wildlife. However, many of the minor ecological treasures neglected by the public, the non-charismatic minifauna, have relatively modest requirements for their preservation.</P><P>     These are best handled by community-based voluntary groups which include scientists. Private sector, not-for-profit organizations can respond to local interests just as museums and schools cater to specialized tastes. Such organizations can avoid the problems created when profits or  political advantages are paramount.</P><P>     Some scientists have a strong antipathy to property rights and the market process. They ignore private sector innovations and cling to the mirage of benevolent, environmentally sensitive federal government.</P><P>       Following the Progressive Era myth of &quot;scientific management&quot; the government will someday empower them as philosopher kings of the ecological domain. Finally, they hope, after a 100 years of trying we may have finally got it right with Jack Ward Thomas running the U.S. Forest Service and Bruce Babbitt (temporarily) our Secretary of Interior.</P><P>     Both experience and theory tell us they are surely wrong. It is no accident that political spending and ecological integrity don't easily mix. In the political calculus, scientific opinion counts less than popular enthusiasm. Non-popular but scientifically well-founded views are more likely to prevail in the voluntary sector. This is where environmentalists should focus their efforts as we seek preservation and sustainable future.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IT is easy to understand why some people find banning private log exports an attractive idea. Superficially, it appears to save jobs, reduce domestic timber prices and slow environmental degradation caused by logging. But there are good, ethical reasons why a ban makes little sense. In later columns, I will discuss the likely economic and environmental consequences of a ban.</P><P>       Government exists to promote harmony and foster prosperity. These goals are hard to attain if political power is used to strip some people of their property to benefit others. Such actions eventually hurt everyone for they erode the foundations of a free society. When property is taken for legitimate public purposes, owners should be compensated for their losses. This is not to happen if private tree farms are prohibited from selling logs abroad. The prohibition surely feels like plunder to those who may suffer it.</P><P>     Protection from political coercion must remain our paramount concern even if raw log exports cost a significant number of Northwest jobs, a far from certain outcome. Liberals and conservatives who understand the social value of the market process understand this. A productive and cooperative social order requires property rights that are secure from arbitrary seizure or reduction in value. Even if a ban on the export of private timber would save jobs, the process it legitimizes leads to increasing conflict and to ethical erosion in relationships among citizens.</P><P>     Some politicians face strong incentives to prohibit timber owners from selling their logs to foreigners. They seek political gain by playing on people's fears that global commerce means the loss of jobs and security. Politicians flirt with a destructive game when they try to generate campaign contributions and electoral support by favoring one group or person at another's expense. Yet, average citizens remain unaware of the unintended consequences of these actions.</P><P>     Opportunistic behavior, not compassion, explains the export ban. This is no accident. In politics, duplicity accompanies opportunism and honorable behavior is a severe liability. Honorable politicians are like vegetarian coyotes in that they face a great handicap when competing with their red-meat opponents.</P><P>     Although many of us are disgusted with pork-barrel politics, we often reward our representatives with re-election when they secure our pork. Congress loses respect but our representative is well-regarded. It is easy to rationalize socially destructive behavior by someone we know well. People often see their representative as a good person who must compete in an institution where principles are a liability. The institution brings out their worst and causes many to flee national politics.</P><P>     Everyone has good reason to oppose political opportunism. The reason is simple: Politicians who will steal for you will also steal from you. History shows that politicians are rarely bought, but often rented until someone is willing to pay more. This is why it is so important to reward politicians who are true to their principles. (And why so many of us are offended by the hypocrisy of &quot;conservatives&quot; who advocate governmental subsidies for the rich.) When government can arbitrarily constrain property rights and freedom to trade on our own terms, no one is safe. Even if intentions are pure and ends legitimate (e.g., saving jobs), relying on coercion to impose an uncompensated loss is neither ethical nor wise.</P><P>     In economics as in ecology, we can never do just one thing. We cannot predict the mischief that will arise to confound our intentions when we use politics to generate private benefits for one by taking from another, e.g., taking markets from owners of private timber. The more government becomes the granter of special opportunities and special privileges, the more people will seek them from government. And they always come at others' expense.</P><P>     An export ban may preserve jobs in timber processing while destroying those in shipping. It may even harm Northwest mill workers as disinvestment occurs and private timber investment shifts to the Southeast and abroad. More generally, we create an environment in which no one's property, income, or job is safe when we legitimize transferring resources among citizens by stripping or attenuating the property rights of one group to benefit another. We create the Founding Fathers' nightmare: a political economy of plunder.</P><P>     When constitutional protections of individual rights and limits on government power are respected, they serve us admirably. These protections - embodied in the takings, contract and commerce clauses, provisions for impartial trials, and the safeguards in the Bill of Rights and later amendments - are designed to shield us from the predations of government. The U.S. Constitution was designed to foster a political economy of justice with respect for other's possessions. Society becomes less civil and less productive when we stray from this design.</P><P>     The ban on log exports would cause economic and environmental harm. This is important and I'll discuss these problems in my next column. But most of all, the ban violates fundamental ethical principles that underlie our Constitution and our nation. Arbitrarily taking something of value from one group and giving it to another can only undermine liberty and security. The export ban may be good short-term politics but it is pregnant with mischief.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>MANY people share my deep concern with improving and protecting the wildlife, watersheds, and recreation values of forests. Good policy links these goods with sound economic practices. All require landowners' confidence in the future. The proposed export ban on raw logs from private lands subverts this confidence and undermines the management required to reach these goals.</P><P>       Proponents of the export ban claim it will save jobs and prevent foreign exploitation of our timber resources. These claims reflect poor thinking or personal interests promoted at the public's expense, not legitimate economic, ethical or environmental arguments.</P><P>     A ban on private log exports has several important, negative effects. It undermines the value of private stands of trees. A ban reduces the prices bid for raw logs and the timber's value. Private owners fear that future laws or regulations may further reduce the value of their timber. Owners and exporters who suffer a politically induced loss today are wary about the possibility of future losses. Hence an export ban shortens investors' time horizons.</P><P>     Trees take a long time to become harvestable; 50 to 100 years is common. Many of us prefer even older forests for we want forests to produce old-growth values. This is what Jerry Franklin and Jack Ward Thomas' &quot;New Forestry&quot; is about: managing forests to resemble old growth.</P><P>     If someone is to invest money, effort and time growing and preserving trees for a lifetime or longer, they need strong assurances that their timber's value will not be reduced by unexpected government intervention. The value of their land depends on expectations of the future value of their trees.</P><P>     Lower timber values immediately reduce people's incentives to preserve and grow timber. Mere talk of a ban could induce some people to log immediately, just as the possibility of endangered species moving to a landowner's land leads many to destroy suitable habitat. A desire to leave the timber market could encourage the rapid conversion of timberland close to cities to residential or commercial use.</P><P>     Moreover, if owners fear for the future, they plant short-rotation monocultures, trees such as cottonwood and eucalyptus that can be harvested for fiber in 10 years or less. By reducing the time between planting and harvest, they reduce the risk of new, unfavorable laws. A ban thus helps promote monocultures and shorter harvest rotations. Do proponents of an export ban really want this?</P><P>        The incentives an export ban creates for timber owners have significant environmental consequences. The public goods associated with long-rotation forests - complex ecosystems, wildlife habitat, biodiversity and aesthetics - will be reduced. We can also expect increased soil erosion, stream siltation and damaged salmon runs.</P><P>     It is important to remember that the most sensitive and valuable ecosystems - those found in old-growth forests - are largely confined to the national forests and parks. Raw log exports from federal forestland have been banned for 25 years. Most private lands harbor second- and third-growth forests. We want their owners to have the means and incentive to adopt ecologically friendly new forestry. An export ban has the opposite impact.</P><P>     A ban will also induce Japan to import more logs from Third World nations that have less stringent environmental protections than the United States. Increasing the demand for their timber is likely to increase environmental damage abroad. Do environmentalists really wish to increase environmental pressures in places with weak democratic institutions and ineffective environmental protections?</P><P>        The employment impact of an export ban, much like the environmental consequences, is sometimes misunderstood. Raw log exports cost few, if any, U.S. jobs. Instead, they create many high-paying jobs in export-related industries such as ocean shipping and inland rail. In addition, the premium foreign timber consumers pay for raw logs is additional money injected into the U.S. economy. Nor are bans likely to protect mill jobs. For example, the 1979 ban of red cedar exports failed to halt a decline in Washington cedar mills from 337 to 52.</P><P>     Raw log exports also lead to the purchase of forest products such as wooden doors and paneling. Raw logs introduce foreign consumers to the quality of U.S. products. The initial exposure builds contacts and leads to the purchase of our timber products. Commerce Department data reveals that processed products comprise 89 percent of the $17 billion market in U.S. forest products exports.</P><P>     Thus, neither economic theory nor historical experience supports the belief that a ban will preserve U.S. jobs. The Center for International Trade and Forestry's (CINTRAFOR) computer model, backed by 10 years of research, supports this criticism. Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and others who support the ban base their position on bad economics or expedient politics, not the public interest.</P><P>     A ban on exports has negative economic and environmental consequences. It contains disincentives to long-term forestry, to environmentally valuable habitat preservation, to jobs in the Northwest and elsewhere, and to increasing the sale of finished wood products in foreign markets. But most important, it erodes the ethical foundations of our society and political economy. The ethical problem alone is sufficient reason to strongly oppose the ban.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>THIS is my last column until I return from Montana next autumn.</P><P> While there, I'll continue working on the three E's of environmental policy: ecology, economics and ethics. Only systems that link freedom to act with responsibility for the results of the action work well in dealing with them. Others fail. Linking action with accountability for outcomes is a classic problem of political economy. It plagues efforts to harmonize our environmental and economic interests.</P><P>     All my columns deal with these themes. Next fall, when I return to FREE's Seattle office and the University of Washington, I will again apply economic thinking to pressing environmental and ethical issues. I often think of my columns while bicycling.</P><P>     Seattle and a ranch near Bozeman, Mont., are great places to live. For years, I have wanted to make the spring pilgrimage from Seattle to Bozeman by bicycle. This year my wife Ramona and I joined 110 participants for the first week of Cycle America's annual trip across America.</P><P>     Some bicycle tourists go self-contained. We see these hardy individuals on the road each summer. Their bikes resemble over-loaded pack animals with lumps of clothing, cooking gear, sleeping bags, and tents. Imagine a Porche 911 Carrera towing a U-Haul. These riders proudly identify as self-supported cyclists - others might call them masochists.</P><P>     In contrast, Cycle America provides fully supported tent touring. Trucks transport the extra clothing, sleeping bags and tents, and vans pick up the stragglers. Meals are prepared by people in local communities. The support staff is excellent, cheerful and highly competent. These cycle tourists are neo-Spartan hedonists.</P><P>     In the most luxurious kind of bicycle touring, cyclists carry only sun screen, water and a credit card. They sleep at inns and eat fine food. This Stoic Epicurean cycling is my favorite kind of tour. Each year FREE offers such a &quot;Seminar on Wheels&quot; for special friends. These Bozeman-based tours are &quot;rolling salons&quot; with readings for each day and seminar discussions over dinner. Last year we biked from Yellowstone to Glacier National Park. This year we'll tour the Big Hole Country of Southwest Montana.</P><P>     Linkages between economic and environmental systems are especially clear when cycling. For example, our Cycle America Tour left Bellingham and headed over Rainey and Washington Pass and into Grand Coulee. This area was logged early in the century. We saw large stumps from four to eight feet off the ground. Cyclists asked, &quot;Was logging only in the winter and was stump height determined by snow depth?&quot; No, I explained, the relative value of wood and labor, not snow depth, explains the high stumps of years ago.</P><P>     America had a huge timber inventory. Trees were so plentiful that their value was often negative. Fertile cleared ground was often worth more than land with standing timber.</P><P>     Because trees swell at their base, timber cutters created temporary platforms from which they sawed the trees above the butt swell. This left much high quality wood in the forest, but it saved labor. Our ancestors &quot;wasted&quot; wood to economize on labor.</P><P>     Today the relative values are reversed.</P><P>     We biked past several dozen sawmills filled with second-growth and third-growth logs. Today, some mills utilize tops down to 2 inches in diameter. Twenty-five years ago, some mills would take no top less than 7 inches. But as relative values shift, the market naturally adjusts, responding quickly to changing scarcities.</P><P>     Another adjustment is coming. On the third day of the trip, we arrived at Grand Coulee and Lake Roosevelt. I spoke with Gary Kuiper, recently retired superintendent of Lake Roosevelt National Recreational Area. He had served on parks throughout the United States and loves the Park Service.</P><P>     Throughout his career, he saw politics interfering with sound and sensitive management. He saw no way out of the dilemma between long-term protection and constant short-term political pressures. This political problem is increasingly obvious. It's the natural result of the &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the Progressive Era, a century ago.</P><P>     This approach assumes federal control by experts uncontaminated by self interest or political pressures. However, bureaucratic and political entrepreneurship normally trump scientific understanding, concern for local communities, and property rights. Ecological damage, economic waste, and ethical violations result.</P><P>     As problems grow, concerned citizens seek new answers. People who are intellectually and ethically responsible don't expect different results from the same institutions. They want institutional change. To be successful, new approaches must replace political management. I suggest that we adopt a variety of alternative institutional arrangements. These should be modest and careful experiments that rely on various mixes of nonprofit and for-profit organizations, not federal bureaucracies. The feds will monitor, not manage.</P><P>     We've had a hundred years experience with sylvan socialism and we know a lot about what doesn't work. This summer I'll explore new approaches to these problems with academic and business leaders, federal judges, journalists and environmental writers, and some Montana fun-hog cyclists. I look forward to sharing the results with you during the next academic year.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/biker.gif" WIDTH=341 WIDTH=249><IMG SRC="/free/Images/van.gif" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=176><P>__________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P> EACH summer I'm reminded why John Steinbeck thought that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. This summer, the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) again hosted conferences for federal judges, seminars for environmental writers, bike trips, and research on environmental economics and policy.</P><P>       But I see changes in Montana. One is congestion and the new rich who've discovered the &quot;last best place.&quot; Also, new bureaucratic pathologies have arrived. A dramatic example is the Idaho Pole Superfund site in north Bozeman. Though many cities have Superfund sites - Denver and Salt Lake have three, Seattle has four - they are ripples in the economic ocean of a big city. In Bozeman, they are tidal waves.</P><P>     Professor Richard Stroup, my former colleague, and Sandra Goodman recently published a report on Superfund, EPA's effort to clean up toxic waste (&quot;Rights vs. Regulation; How to Reform Superfund&quot;). Their report includes a description of Bozeman's Idaho Pole facility and indicates that Idaho Pole exemplifies many Superfund sites where health risks are overstated and bureaucratic power enhanced. This is not an accident, for the EPA has strong incentives to push caution to dangerous levels.</P><P>     Twenty-five years ago, I worked in the woods and helped send some of the best and largest lodgepole pines to Idaho Pole. They treated these logs with chemicals to make long lasting wooden utility poles. At some point, a chemical used to treat these poles, pentachlorophenol (PCP), was spilled, leaving what the EPA says are potentially harmful concentrations. The EPA has tried to convince the public that the Idaho Pole site is a threat to the community.</P><P>     But the EPA is probably wrong. EPA calculations of the future risks posed by the Idaho Pole site, as at many other Superfund sites, rely upon shaky assumptions. The EPA assumed that Idaho Pole's property would become a residential trailer park within two years - even though Idaho Pole is profitable - and that residents would drill wells for drinking water even though Bozeman's municipal water supply is already there. The EPA also ignored information from its own Office of Toxic Substances indicating that the concentration of PCP in water decreases by half every 20 to 200 days. Risks that may exist will diminish significantly over time.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman see further problems with the EPA's risk assessments. In identifying Superfund sites, the EPA consistently assumes unlikely, risk-enhancing situations and ignores mitigating factors in their Superfund decisions. Such methodological errors undermine the agency's judgment and make the usefulness of its National Priorities List highly suspect. Yet the Superfund law severely limits the accused polluter's right to review EPA claims in court.</P><P>     Stroup and Goodman do not discuss, but I find more disturbing, Superfund's apparent violations of the spirit of our constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws - laws that make past actions illegal and punishable. It forces firms to finance cleanups of perfectly legitimate activities when no actual harm has been demonstrated.</P><P>     If people were engaged in legal, productive activities and we later decide that cleanup is necessary, we the public should pay. It is not just or equitable to impose cleanup costs on someone whose responsibility is tangential and trivial. But with Superfund's joint and several liability, any involvement can lead to complete responsibility as EPA searches for deep pockets.</P><P>     To a political economist, these problems are predictable consequences of the EPA's incentives. The EPA is blamed when toxic waste harms people directly, but rarely criticized if its regulations harm people in hidden ways. For example, if a highly carcinogenic chemical leached into groundwater, and the EPA failed to act, there would be severe repercussions in Congress.</P><P>     The EPA takes this logic to the extreme, concocts its farfetched &quot;reasonable maximum exposures&quot; and uses them to guide action. Concurrently, the agency discounts the consequences of its cleanup mandates: disruption of local communities and increasing exposure to a chemical by site disturbance. The incentives are to overstate the risks of toxic waste and to discount the human and financial costs of cleaning up.</P><P>     Improving Superfund's environmental performance and reducing its ethical and economic costs requires fundamental reform. First, the EPA's farfetched risk assessments should be replaced by more sober science. Second, people should only be liable for past actions if real harms were wrongly imposed on other people. Even then, they should pay in rough proportion to their responsibility. And third, we should remove the near prohibition on accused polluters having their day in court to challenge EPA directives.</P><P>     Toxic chemicals are not romantic. They lack the appeal of parks or forests. But their lesson is applicable throughout environmental policy: Well-intended government programs often go awry. Successful environmental reform must heed the ecological insight that many actions have unintended consequences. It applies to political economy as well as biology. I explore this theme in future columns.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>LAST week, the Mont Pelerin Society met in Cannes, France, to celebrate the work of its founder, Nobel Prize winning economist Friedrich Hayek.</P><P>       The Mont Pelerin Society is the world's foremost group of classical liberal academic, business and governmental leaders.</P><P>     Six of its 500 members, including Milton Friedman, Gary Becker and George Stigler, a Seattle native, have received Nobel Prizes in economics. This year's keynote address was given by Vaclav Klaus, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.</P><P>     The Mont Pelerin Society was formed in 1947 by people who feared that communist, fascist and socialist regimes would dominate the world.</P><P>     They were prescient in anticipating the crisis of the socialist enterprise, discussed in Professor Daniel Chirot's book &quot;The Crisis of Leninism: The Decline of the Left and the Revolutions of 1989.&quot; They sought to reassert the values of liberty, private property and toleration of people of diverse religious, ethnic and racial backgrounds.</P><P>     Today's members are ahead of the curve in understanding the ethical and economic problems inherent in America's pervasive bureaucratization and regulation of private affairs. Their perspective can help us develop environmental reforms that are both sensitive and practical.</P><P>     I believe that Hayek's classic 1945 article from the American Economic Review, &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; is the best introduction to economics ever written.</P><P>     Hayek shows us how economies are like ecosystems. They are interdependent, complex, and must constantly adjust. When we read this article, we can better understand why there are such huge conflicts between bureaucracies, which drive toward uniformity, and ecosystems, where knowledge of local circumstances is critically important.</P><P>     Planning fails because the information needed to create products and coordinate human activity is widely scattered. Central planners, like everyone else, can obtain only a tiny fraction of this knowledge, and are thereby precluded from serving people's economic desires and fostering innovation.</P><P>     Hayek's simple, yet tremendously powerful and far-reaching insight has grown in importance over time. Economies, like ecosystems, cannot be designed. No one can run them. Both evolve and prosper to the extent that their inhabitants remain in sync with the laws of nature.</P><P>     A capitalist ecosystem is populated by organizations and industries rather than organisms and species.</P><P>     Economic life evolves by technological innovation and market competition much as biological life evolves by genetic mutation and natural selection. Both involve intricate webs of innumerable participants, each pursuing his own interests, but linked into a whole greater than the sum of the parts.</P><P>     Hayek's legacy is powerful because his insights are timeless; they speak to all ages and cultures. But equally important, they have been vindicated by experience. As he warned in &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; socialism has failed everywhere it was tried at the national level, creating police state nightmares from Utopian dreams and economic chaos from &quot;rational planning.&quot;</P><P>       One of socialism's many victims was environmental quality. Throughout the former U.S.S.R. the legacy of bureaucracies' single-minded focus on industrialization and production is starkly evident.</P><P>     For example, at Russia's Magnitogorsk, site of the world's biggest steel complex, 90 percent of the children born in the city suffered from pollution-related illnesses. Feshbach and Friendly, authors of &quot;Ecocide in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; state that in 1992, &quot;there are no major industrial cities in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children.&quot;</P><P>       Aside from a few professors insulated from reality, Americans realize that communism and socialism are corrupting and economically bankrupt systems. Less clear, but just as pernicious, are the consequences of our experiments in sylvan socialism, begun with the creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1897.</P><P>     The Forest Service was the prototype for much of environmental management. Our most recent major creation, the EPA, relies on the same assumptions with tragic consequences. For example, a joint EPA-Amoco Corporation study of Amoco's Yorktown refinery found that EPA-mandated pollution controls were three times more costly than necessary. By making environmental protection more expensive, the EPA reduces the amount of protection people demand and can afford.</P><P>     As we prepare to celebrate the centennial of the Forest Service, it is incumbent on us to consider the deficiencies of the socialist model. Hayek contributes to our understanding. By following his principles we can create policies that harmonize ecological and economic values.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>IS economics an enemy of ecology? Many environmentalists seem to think so. They portray economists as insensitive number crunchers with Republican leanings, people stricken by a ghoulish preference for money over ecological integrity. The perceived focus of economics - money, business and mathematics - is distasteful to people motivated by environmental concerns.</P><P>       But greens' conventional wisdom is wrong. Economic analysis can be environmentalism's best tool. By considering how economics can further environmental objectives, we may be able to alleviate greens' allergy to economics.</P><P>     Since most resources are scarce, we lose opportunities if we fail to minimize waste. Tumbleweeds in Arizona, spotted knapweed in Montana and bureaucrats in the Department of Agriculture are so overabundant that they are &quot;bads&quot; - not goods. Items we value should be treated as though they are scarce.</P><P>     When environmental policies waste talent, time or material, the price of environmental protection is higher than necessary. The economist's &quot;first law of demand,&quot; a social analog to the law of gravity, states that as the price of a good rises, demand falls. Making environmental quality needlessly expensive subverts environmental goals because the expense lowers people's demand for environmental protection. Americans' growing opposition to needlessly expensive Superfund sites is just one example.</P><P>     To make the most of limited environmental dollars and to achieve real improvements in pollution control, watershed protection and other important goals, we should first address those problems where the payoffs are greatest per dollar invested. This requires risk-benefit analysis, a method of comparing values (lives, endangered species) that can be saved by investing resources on different problems. Not all activities generate equal benefits. Since we can't do everything, risk-benefit analysis helps us choose among our options.</P><P>     Greens have shown a curious reluctance to accept risk analysis. Some groups have included it in the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of principles they oppose in environmental legislation.</P><P>     But, in terms of achieving green values, environmentalists are misguided when they reject risk analysis. Eliminating some very expensive regulations would save lives or improve health if we thereby free up resources enabling people to achieve less-onerous environmental objectives. Eliminating extremely costly regulations also increases incomes, saving roughly one life for every $7.5 million added to our economy. Richer really is safer and cleaner.</P><P>     Risk analysis is one way to get more for our environmental efforts. Another is minimizing government micromanagement. When government agencies try to specify how people are to reach environmental objectives, waste and ineffective policies are the predictable result.</P><P>     Consider the case of the Amoco Corporation's Yorktown, Va., oil refinery. Amoco and the EPA conducted a two-year joint study into how chemical emissions from the Yorktown plant were addressed by existing regulations. They found that EPA regulations required pollution controls that ignored major sources of pollution and were roughly $30 million more expensive than the more-effective approaches uncovered by the study. Amoco's costs were nearly four times greater than needed to achieve regulatory goals, $41 million versus $11 million. Nevertheless, existing regulations disallow the more-efficient strategies.</P><P>     The Yorktown case illustrates problems endemic to national environmental regulations. Sweeping, undifferentiated regulations are necessarily inflexible, excessively costly, and do little to control pollution. They make few allowances for local situations. Like the Forest Service, BLM and other large centralized bureaucracies, the EPA's regulations are at odds with the ecology of particular places.</P><P>     Thoughtful risk analysis and the end of regulatory micromanagement can yield better and less-expensive environmental protection.</P><P>     Some environmental organizations, such as Defenders of Wildlife and the Environmental Defense Fund, are pursuing principled, innovative and constructive policies. However, the leaders of other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, see a niche in crisis entrepreneurship. They use shoddy science and biased media coverage to exaggerate (as with chlorine) or fabricate (as with Alar) environmental dangers. These efforts pressure government officials to adopt wasteful policies.</P><P>     By exaggerating environmental dangers, and posturing as the great green hope with full-page ads in The New York Times, crisis entrepreneurs seduce members and donations. Their budgets, professional status and political influence may increase in the short run. But environmental protection is lost and ethical standards are eroded. Ultimately, the credibility of the environmental movement is reduced.</P><P>     Economics does not offer a cure-all. Environmental quality implies real changes and real costs. But economics helps us better use our scarce efforts to craft effective policies. It exposes those seeking to use the public's interest in environmental protection for private ends. This is why some fear the use of environmental economics.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>&quot;THE Tragedy of the Commons&quot; appeared in Science magazine in 1968.</P><P> Though written by an ecologist, Garret Hardin, the article is a classic of political economy.</P><P>     Understanding the logic of this article should be a requirement of running for political office. It explains how and why we should expect waste when biological resources such as fisheries are openly available.</P><P>     The logic of the commons is straightforward. When no one has control over a resource, be it a parcel of ocean or a dormitory lounge, it tends to be poorly maintained, overused, or depleted. Without social or legal constraints, some people will maximize their personal advantages to the detriment of others. All users suffer, while benefits go to the exploiting individual. The incentive is for people to seek narrow personal advantages at the expense of the group and the resource. Few people act as wise stewards because others take a &quot;free ride&quot; on such actions, and rarely reciprocate.</P><P>     The North Pacific groundfish fishery within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone off Alaska exemplifies a commons problem. Under the current open-access regime, there are only indirect controls on fishing. Short seasons and restrictions on fishing boats' size and horsepower are examples. These controls are extremely inefficient, have resulted in billions of dollars in excessive capital investment, and encourage chaotic races for fish that magnify the dangers of an already risky job.</P><P>     Experience suggests the problem may get worse under the current open-access system. Human, ecological and financial losses are likely to increase as the race for the fish becomes more frenzied. Brief, hurried seasons will increase pressure on fish populations and promote bycatch - the incidental capture of non-target species. Fortunately, unlike many of the world's fisheries, the basic stock remains healthy for now.</P><P>     A smart, honest and principled political leader could create huge safety, economic and ecological benefits by seriously addressing our fishery commons. Action need not be difficult, for we already have a solution. It is individual transferable quotas (ITQs) - a method of creating secure, transferable and reasonably well-defined property rights to fish. Here's how they work.</P><P>     First, peer reviewed research establishes the biologically sustainable yield of a fishery: how many fish can be taken without reducing the quantity or quality of the catch over time. Because these are estimates, not certainties, the allowable catch is always less than the theoretical maximum. Based on this estimated yield, a set of quotas is issued. Each entitles its holder to a fixed percentage of the total allowable catch.</P><P>     The initial distribution of rights has wealth implications. That's why parceling out quotas is the contentious feature of ITQ systems. Assigning quotas is one of the main factors delaying action by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the body overseeing the region's fisheries. The two principal alternatives for distributing quotas are a giveaway to existing fishermen, or an auction, perhaps one open to the public.</P><P>     With an ITQ system, quota holders have secure claims to a percentage of the total allowable catch. Only those with quotas may fish. Fishermen need not race to get their share. An extended fishing season means fewer days at sea for long hours or in dangerous weather. We'd also expect reductions in bycatch.</P><P>     Quotas give their owners incentives to conserve fish. As long as fisheries remain a commons, there are strong incentives to catch as many fish as quickly as possible. With ITQs, fishermen can increase the value of their quota and the size of their future catch, by allowing fish populations to increase. Such behavior has already been observed in the wreckfish, Southern bluefin tuna and various shellfish fisheries.</P><P>     With ownership, quotas can be bought and sold. Some fishermen will exit the industry. The more efficient fishermen and those who love fishing will buy or retain quotas and remain. Fewer ships and less equipment will be needed to catch a given amount of fish, reducing overhead and improving efficiency. And ITQs do not necessarily favor large operations over smaller ones.</P><P>     An increasing number of professional environmentalists, including well-respected economists with the Environmental Defense Fund, are showing an interest in ITQs. ITQs have the support of associations representing more than 80 percent of the seafood harvested in the North Pacific fisheries. They are the least painful way to downsize an industry made dangerous by short seasons and by federal subsidies that have promoted excessive investments in men, ships and equipment.</P><P>     The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has, overall, resisted consideration of ITQs, although its own staff concluded such a system would solve many of the industry's problems.</P><P>     Political entrepreneurs such as Greenpeace and the Alliance Against IFQs (IFQs being roughly similar to ITQs) have opposed ITQs because they fear the impact of such quotas on their private interests. Though we may sympathize with their concerns, political leadership is required to overcome their opposition to a valuable improvement in fishery management. Without it, more lives will be lost and politically sanctioned ecological plunder will continue. </P><P> _________</P><P>  John A.

Baden</P><P>IN addition to their disappointment with the elections, major environmental groups are learning the pain of limits to growth.</P><P>       From 1990 to 1993, membership fell 33 percent for Greenpeace and 35 percent for the Wilderness Society. The Sierra Club has lost 130,000 members and has accumulated deficits of nearly $3 million. Although groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the folks who brought us the Alar hoax, have held even, overall memberships peaked in 1990 and have been falling ever since. Only the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that values entrepreneurship and stresses incentives, has gained a substantial number of members.</P><P>     What explains these dramatic losses? Why are people electing to invest less time and money in the traditional green groups? As with most interesting economic changes, several forces are at work.</P><P>     First, with Clinton in the White House, Gore at the Naval Observatory, Babbitt in Interior, and ecologist Jack Ward Thomas as titular head of the Forest Service, some environmentalists believe that our environment is in good hands. They think they can relax their vigilance, secure in the belief that the people from the Potomac will manage our natural resources with prudence and sensitivity. With the environment covered by jolly green giants, concerned greens can direct their efforts to other causes.</P><P>     Today's situation is similar to that faced when Jimmy Carter was in office. The &quot;good guys&quot; were in Washington and green groups' memberships and money declined. Some believe God sent Jim Watt, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Interior, to save the environmental movement. Watt personified evil and exploitation, making it easy to recruit crusaders to battle him.</P><P>     Second, the upper middle class and the wealthy provide most of the financial support for environmental groups. At the same time, Americans in the top 5 percent of the income distribution pay 43 percent of all personal income taxes. This is a terribly big hit. With government taking an ever bigger first bite, charities are bound to suffer. If the top 5 percent were paying 25 percent rather than 43 percent, contributions to all charities, the arts, churches, hospitals and schools, would increase dramatically. When government takes more there is simply less for worthy causes.</P><P>     The third reason is by far the most complex. It involves culture and political evolution as well as economics. However, the short version is easily stated: Professional environmentalists have been found out.</P><P>     For 25 years, the professional environmental groups have postured as selfless defenders of the public interest. The myth is that these underpaid servants of ecological integrity fight the public's battles against big business. Armed mainly with truth, virtue and purity, they fight the good fight though heavily outgunned. Clearly, all well-intentioned people would support such champions. But after a generation of success, the environmental organizations grew fat and rich. Their myth is losing its luster. Increasingly, people believe that under the costume of virtue lies sleaze and flab.</P><P>     Jim Watt actually hurt the environmental groups because he cost them their purity. Before Watt, most of us who joined were active in the outdoors. Although there was overlap, Audubon was for bird watchers, Sierra Club was for climbers, the Wilderness Society was for backpackers, and so forth. We were lifestyle members; our environmentalism was integrated with our living.</P><P>     Watt so offended those sensitive to environmental values that previously uninvolved people stampeded to the environmental movement. The organized groups became trapped by their gains. As David Foreman, a founder of Earth First! told me, Sierra stressed Club more than rocks and Wilderness emphasized Society more than trees. For most of the new members, environmentalism was a cause rather than a lifestyle, and today most causes have short lives. Stable members became ephemeral. Homelessness, world hunger, reproductive rights and other causes offered competing opportunities for well-intentioned people to demonstrate their good intentions by writing letters and sending checks.</P><P>     With every good cause competing, the leaders of green groups emphasized marketing. They became salesmen, their product was their cause. A premium was placed on exaggerating or fabricating environmental crises to galvanize members and attract new recruits. But there's a tension between maintaining integrity and making the sale.</P><P>     Incentives to make environmental problems big, dramatic and scary led to half-truths or outright lies about the actual risks of many alleged environmental crises. Alar, toxic waste, ivory, global warming, and other issues were often distorted by green groups as they tried to maintain their membership and budgets.</P><P>     Time has exposed environmentalists as just another special interest. Every dollar spent on a cause defined in New York and D.C. offices is a dollar less for local problems people can see and feel. The obvious failures of legislation such as Superfund and the problems with the Endangered Species Act caution people to be skeptical of dire warnings from Manhattan and the Beltway.</P><P>     Just as political corruption and deception have fueled a voter backlash, so deception by green groups has real consequences. A new environmentalism that recognizes the importance of property rights, entrepreneurship and incentives must emerge if we are to preserve environmental quality and ethical integrity.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HOW HAS Forbes magazine, the self-described capitalist tool, become a green advocate? The influential people at Forbes see markets as the most ethical and efficient means to coordinate much of society.</P><P>       In contrast, political management implies economic inefficiencies and ecological destruction. These are logical consequences of political incentives.</P><P>     A recent Forbes feature by Ellie Winninghoff explains how government subsidies promote environmental harm. Here is a sordid story of socialism for the wealthy and duplicity by politicians whose opportunism trumps their environmentalism.</P><P>     Three-fourths of the Pacific Northwest's electricity comes from hydroelectric dams. Many of these, including Bonneville and Grand Coulee, were financed by the taxpayers through the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers.</P><P>     Once built, the feds subsidized electricity, making power here far cheaper than in other regions of the country. Nearly $1 billion in annual subsidies keep Washington's power prices at about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Industrial consumers such as Alcoa, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical, and Reynolds Metals pay even less.</P><P>     But insulating households and businesses from the real costs of power production has negative consequences. In addition to lost revenue, these costs include diminished salmon runs, lost wild rivers, wasteful irrigation and  additional coal-fired power elsewhere. These dams, along the Columbia and Snake, strangle formerly rich salmon runs. Salmon populations are only 15-25 percent of their 19th century levels. Some runs are gone.</P><P>     Here's how dams effect salmon. When hatchlings move from the upriver spawning beds to the Pacific, the slack, warm waters of reservoirs and the blades of hydroelectric turbines take a high toll. Mortality runs about 15 percent per dam. When mature salmon swim from the Pacific to the inland Northwest, the big dams again pose a formidable obstacle. Even with fish ladders, upstream travel has a mortality of 5-13 percent per dam.</P><P>     With 14 major dams on the main stem of the Columbia, and 10 on the Snake River, mortality quickly mounts. The Grand Coulee and Hells Canyon dams completely block salmon from the upper stretches of these rivers. Transporting hatchlings around dams and using hatchery fish has sorry results; hatchery fish are weaker and more disease prone than wild salmon. Thus, in spite of expensive efforts, the runs are dying. Ecological health declines, outdoor recreation suffers, and a perpetually renewable resource is lost.</P><P>     In the Northwest the price of electricity is less than its cost. With rates kept at 3 cents per kilowatt, Northwest consumers use 60 percent more electricity than average Americans. This compares to New York's 10.2 cents, Califomia's 9.7 cents, and Florida's 7 cents. In an age when power can be wheeled around the country, this implies huge unnecessary economic and environmental waste.</P><P>     Insulated from the information and incentives communicated by prices, people don't respond to changing values and ecological conditions. Continued high consumption, not conservation, of electricity is encouraged by subsidized power. And greater use of electricity favors running turbines to maximize production with continuing damage to remaining salmon runs.</P><P>     This story of dams and salmon illustrates a principle of political economy. Once subsidies are created, they persist. People view them as entitlements. Major electricity users, especially aluminum companies, invest in politics to keep power subsidies. Our representatives and senators seldom act in a principled way if that raises voters' electric bills to fair market rates.</P><P>     Dams generate not only power but also opportunistic politicians. For example, in 1982, then-representative Al Gore of Tennessee invited William Niskanen, an economist nationally respected for both his intelligence and integrity, to his office. Gore asked for a casual, informal meeting to discuss Niskanen's planned research into the pricing policy of federal power agencies. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was important to Gore, and so he organized a manipulative ploy to protect his constituents' pork - cheap TVA power.  Niskanen arrived to find not the promised casual conversation, but rather TV cameras and other congressmen. Gore staged the meeting as a Star Chamber interrogation for the consumption of home districts.</P><P>     Gore's showmanship paid off. Oregon's Mike Hatfield, a Republican, passed the &quot;Niskanen Amendment.&quot; This act prohibited government officials from studying how market pricing could improve federal power pricing. The subsidies remained unexamined and unchallenged by those best positioned to do so.</P><P>     This tale of political privileges and opportunism does not imply that markets are perfect. Market prices will poorly reflect the value of salmon or of free flowing rivers. But market-driven power production and allocation won't subsidize environmental harm as federal hydropower has done for five decades.  With vested interests behind each dam, the feds radically increased stakes in subsidies. Adjustments are difficult, salmon suffer, and ethics erode.</P><P>     The problems which flow from federal power subsidies exemplify the complementary interests of groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and National Taxpayers Union. Greens, fiscal conservatives, and supporters of reduced government all favor the elimination of power subsidies.</P><P>     The question is, will the new political leaders realize the potential to harmonize economics, ecology, ethics, and growing demands for limited government?</P><P>       While we hope they will act in a principled manner, we should not confuse our hopes with our expectations. Yet, as Al Gore said on page 236 of his book, Earth in the Balance, &quot;a pattern of dysfunctionality need not persist indefinitely, and the key to change is the harsh light of truth.&quot; And when dams break, the truth may flood out.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>WHAT is a hero? In literary epics such as &quot;Gilgamesh,&quot; the &quot;Illiad,&quot; or &quot;Beowulf,&quot; heroes are those who defy pain and death to live out a personal code of unqualified honor. In economists' parlance, heroes risk significant personal costs to help others. Heroism continues today, though it is, as always, in short supply.</P><P>       The familiar hero jumps into an icy river to save a drowning child. Such isolated, impulsive acts are dramatic and admirable, but are not the most important kind of heroism. The more important involves standing against the tide of opinion to do what is right. Such people may resist the power of an abusive government or cultural norms that harm the less fortunate or the environment. Two heroes in this tradition are Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley.</P><P>     Arthur Temple Jr. was born in l920, and for 26 years ran the Temple family's extensive timber empire in east Texas. In l973, he merged Temple Industries with the much larger and highly diversified Time Inc., becoming a major shareholder in Time. Arthur Temple was an entrepreneur who transformed Temple Industries into a major forest products company.</P><P>     But Temple's heroism is only tangentially related to his business success. For many years, Temple's formative years, rural people in southeast Texas attached little importance to environmental values. Since wildlife habitat had no immediate dollar value, it was ignored by the east Texas forest industry. Forest-dependent wildlife were open-access, common-pool resources. With no one to protect them, entire species were decimated by poor forestry and poaching.</P><P>     Temple stood against these pressures for years to enforce stewardship on his lands. His conservation efforts affronted the dominant culture. Arson and threats of violence were commonplace. But Temple persisted and today Temple Inland remains a national leader in supporting and applying wildlife research.</P><P>     Temple is also a civil-rights hero. Six years before &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; he led the integration of schools in his company's town of Diboll, Texas. In the mid-1960s, a group of civil-rights activists was traveling through the South, going into segregated restaurants and staging sit-ins if they were refused service. Temple Industries had built a cafe in Diboll, the Pine Bough, to provide company visitors and residents with a quality restaurant.</P><P>     The manager called Arthur Temple, then company president, saying these activists would soon test the Pine Bough - what should he do? &quot;Serve 'em&quot; replied Temple. Then, realizing this might be difficult for the manager, Temple said he could work the cash register and his wife could wait tables. Temple led by example to overcome the prejudices of his time. With such leadership, the regular staff handled the situation.</P><P>     Our other hero is Harry E. Teasley Jr., CEO of the Coca-Cola Nestle joint enterprise headquartered in Tampa, Fla. Teasley vigorously opposed the construction of a taxpayer-subsidized hotel intended to boost business for Tampa's money-losing, city-owned convention center.</P><P>     Teasley had a principled opposition to this misadventure in civic socialism. He spent $15,000 of his own money on a public opinion survey. The survey, done by a professional polling firm, showed 90 percent of Tampa's voters wanted a referendum on the hotel's bonds. Two-thirds of registered voters opposed publicly subsidized funding. Teasley then purchased an ad in the Tampa Tribune Times explaining the economic and ethical problems with the hotel. Teasley had no financial interest in the hotel or convention business. He was simply a public-spirited citizen with the means, the character, and the intelligence to promote good public policy.</P><P>     Like Arthur Temple, Harry Teasley took the hero's stance. In doing so, he demonstrates the difference between being pro-business and pro-free market. There was strong business support for the hotel - the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and Tampa Downtown Partnership urged the City Council's support. Before Teasley, there was only weak opposition because people of substance wouldn't take a public position.</P><P>     Like Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's &quot;Enemy of the People,&quot; Teasley stood up and told the truth. Defying the business community, he kept standing and telling the truth. Unlike Dr. Stockman, Teasley won.</P><P>     Teasley offered a pro-free market position with strong theoretical and ethical legitimacy: Government should not subsidize services that are provided by the market. Since wealth and political power go together, such subsidies become socialism for the well-off. Tampa's convention center was an economic loser, and the hotel could not rescue it. As Ludwig von Mises noted: &quot;Government intervention always breeds economic dislocations that necessitate more Government intervention.&quot;</P><P>       Heroes such as Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley are important to all societies; their behavior exemplifies values we want people to emulate. They defy prevailing opinion, be it racial prejudice, faith in socialism, or poaching. Heroes are role models who make it easier for the less-courageous to act justly. At a time when there is widespread cynicism toward those active in public affairs, we should recognize and honor our heroes. We are going to need more of them.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>THE University of Washington has just suffered a $12 million budget cut. Political pressures within the university are to spread the pain by giving each college and program a proportional cut. With each unit suffering, say, a 2.4 percent reduction, no one has a strong incentive to mobilize to protect their special, provincial interest.</P><P>       Such caving-in minimizes short-run pain but gradually erodes quality. To avoid this erosion, hard choices must be made. It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible to pretend these choices away and wait for better times, perhaps after the next president is appointed. While there's no unambiguously happy ending, at least we'll have a better reading of people's character as the process unfolds.</P><P>     Our budgetary shortfall is neither transitory nor local. Universities' golden age has passed, but our expectations lag reality. As David Goodstein, vice provost at Caltech noted, universities are on the threshold of &quot;the permanent era of constraint.&quot; Federal and state governments are reducing aid. They have tight budgets and electorates resist further tax increases. After years of tuition growth, some falling enrollments, and the expenses of increasing diversity, many schools cannot maintain current budgets of existing programs. This is most evident in California but these pressures are nationwide.</P><P>     Like other large complex organizations, units within universities are often run with an eye toward the benefits of those in them, not only for their stated purpose. When tough decisions are being made, we should expect the affected faculty and administrators to carefully weigh the expected impact of those decisions on their own well-being. These considerations of self interest often trump both the social value of their programs and the interests of students in general. Given human nature, it will not be otherwise.</P><P>     Hence, when universities face cutbacks, an adverse selection process goes to work. And here's the unhappy result: Those with the sorriest prospects on the outside (or at other universities) have the greatest incentive to keep their present positions. University politics often get especially nasty as projected losers attempt to discredit the university's leadership. An important principle of political economy becomes evident - last guys don't finish nice.</P><P>     A Ph.D. does not grant immunity from the labor market. Unless protected from market forces, by tenure for example, professors are usually paid an amount roughly equal to their value outside. This is why the salaries in medical schools are substantially higher than those in medieval studies, higher in computer science than in classics, higher in economics than in ecology. Some are paid less than their social contribution, and many find this unfair, but this is how the world works.</P><P>     It doesn't require training in economics to understand this process. Those with poor options elsewhere will fight the hardest to maintain their positions. They argue that the pain should be shared equally and programs spared. They find many arguments why their program should be saved and they mobilize pressures to retain their existing budget share. Given the stakes, it would be naive to expect any other behavior.</P><P>     But not all resistance is self-serving. We face the classic elements of tragedy when legitimate values collide and people face competing, inconsistent obligations. Some people in programs slated for elimination are no doubt highly dedicated and competent. Most will sincerely believe that their program is more valuable to the university stakeholders than some others being retained. And in these terribly important cases, there is no clear and objective standard of evaluation.</P><P>     This is not an easy time to be the president of a great university. Cuts cannot be avoided. Because of rigidities and scale requirements, the responsible decision is to cut marginal programs out entirely. The pressures are to share the pain and keep all alive but on short rations. The universities that remain in the top tier will focus their resources on the high-quality programs. The president has the responsibility to take the grand view and maximize quality.</P><P>     Only in Lake Wobegon are all departments and programs above average. Every large first-rate university has some second- or third-rate departments, schools and programs. When crunch time comes, they should go. This is the most intellectually and ethically responsible policy. Good leaders of great universities must select by quality and contribution to excellence. Since we can't have everything, we should resist political pressures and keep the best and most valuable. It requires great character, intelligence and judgment to do this. The demonstration of such qualities is the positive feature of the classic tragedies.</P><P>     William Gerberding, president of UW, was courageous when he announced a cut of faculty and departments. For the long-run future of a great university, Gerberding made the right decision. The question is, will he be able to implement it?</P><P>       When a drought hits and feed gets short, the rancher can choose from two strategies: put all stock on short rations, or as my grandfather would say, &quot;It's time to put wheels under the poor cows and take them to market.&quot; He knew that herd quality would suffer if we didn't cull now. University presidents face the same reality.</P><P>_____________</P><P>  John A.

Baden</P><P>I'M home at the ranch for the holidays, recalling Christmas traditions.</P><P>      Both my family and my wife feed our animals special rations on Christmas morning. My grandmother would bake oatmeal biscuits with lots of meat trimmings for their dog and a warm corn mash for her chickens. Granddad would give the cows and sheep leafy, second-cutting clover and the horses extra oats, even though they wouldn't work that day. My wife, Ramona, and her father would take a toboggan-load of hay to the old buffalo bulls on the Targhee National Forest.</P><P>     The ewes on our Montana ranch, bred to lamb in March, were on maintenance rations: 7 bales of hay for each 100 ewes. As they became heavy with lambs, we fed more and more of ever more nutritious feed. Yet, on Christmas, we'd give them a treat and a preview of good food to come: second-cutting alfalfa and some soybean cake.</P><P>     In financial terms this made no sense, but the sheep loved it and we felt warm. We depended on our animals and they on us. Each Christmas we'd give them more than good husbandry.</P><P>     Urban people can't easily celebrate Christmas by pampering livestock. However, they can still do a good deed for animals, predators and, later, those lower on the food chain, by restoring balance to the system. My proposal even fits with the new mood in Washington, D.C. Here it is.</P><P>     After writing your holiday letters to friends and loved ones, write another to your senators and member of Congress asking them to cut off the federal Animal Damage Control (ADC) program.</P><P>     The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ADC's program is quite broad. It helps protect corn and sunflowers from blackbirds, airplanes from hawks, geese, and owls, and pasture land from prairie dogs. However, the ADC's largest single mission is livestock protection (or predator control) in Western states. With overhead, its livestock protection costs run $13 million a year.</P><P>     Many of us find the ADC's predator-control program offensive. Not only has ADC exterminated wolves, bears, and mountain lions in many of the contiguous 48 states, it employs barbaric methods. Many people find cyanide poisoning, steel leg traps and aerial hunts offensive. We carried rifles to protect stock from rogue animals, but ADC is indiscriminate, killing problem animals and innocents alike.</P><P>     Even people indifferent to animal welfare should question the value of the ADC. ADC efforts are allocated politically. A series of National Academy of Sciences reports consistently indicate these efforts don't significantly reduce livestock predation. This is again documented by Randal O'Toole in his magazine, Different Drummer.</P><P>     It shouldn't be so expensive to kill animals, but federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act all constrain ADC's effectiveness. These laws divert time and money from predator control to environmental-impact reports. We again find the government doing inefficiently something it shouldn't be doing at all.</P><P>     Congress' desire to use predator control as a re-election tool means that funds are politically targeted to favored congressional districts not, for example, spent on non-lethal research. Congress targeted $2.1 million to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds and $248,000 to protect maple trees from squirrels during 1987-1994. These funds overwhelmingly went to states with congressional representatives on the agricultural subcommittees of the appropriations committees. Nearly 40 percent of the ADC's federal funds accrue to the 27,000 ranchers who graze livestock on public lands. The average subsidy is $550 per year, and far more for those ranchers who have permits for cheap grazing on federal rangelands.</P><P>     Concentrating the ADC's benefits on politically connected people makes little economic sense. Losses to predators or other wildlife are a cost of doing business. We lowered coyote, bear and mountain lion predation by placing guard dogs with our sheep. This was expensive and time intensive but ultimately a good investment.</P><P>     The mere existence of the ADC encourages ranchers and farmers to take fewer private precautions against predator losses. Subsidies short-circuit market signals telling us which areas are best suited for range stock operations. A bounty for coyote pelts - paid by stock growers associations, not by taxpayers who object to the practices - would be significantly cheaper and surely more ethical. Should a committed vegetarian be forced to subsidize this killing?</P><P>       Subsidizing the destruction of animals is offensive on ecological, ethical and economic grounds. It is past time to put ADC away. Do something nice for animals this holiday season by writing Washington, D.C. And be sure to copy Newt.</P><P>_______</P><P> John A.

BADEN </P><P>           CLINTON'S appointments of two strong environmentalists to the posts of secretary of the interior and administrator of EPA have alarmed many business leaders. But the choices of Bruce Babbitt and Carol Browner for these key environmental positions accurately reflect the &quot;greening of America.&quot; They reconfirm the practical necessity for business to act in environmentally sensitive ways.</P><P>       Clinton and Gore's environmental moves signify a definitive break with the tradition of resource development. While there may be a more kind and gentle future for America's bears and bunnies, the businesses upon which our prosperity depends can expect more stringent environmental standards.</P><P>       An important new mission for business is to demonstrate how this greening of America can coexist with increasing efficiency and productivity.</P><P>     This challenge is especially critical to the Northwest. Here in America's  &quot;ecotopia&quot; the conflicts between economy and ecology are pronounced. The economies of the Northwest developed when culture and institutions were oriented toward resource exploitation. Our history is largely a story of damming, logging, mining and ranching. Yet more than any other region, the Northwest is home of the environmentally conscious.</P><P>     With our mix of resource-based industries, changing the environmental behavior of business is neither costless nor smooth. Environmentalists have a vital stake in a successful transition, for if our businesses are not able to adapt to the new standards, we will lose the standard of living upon which our willingness and ability to pay for environmental quality depends.</P><P>     Economist Don Coursey has pointed out that in the United States and other  developed nations, when the income of a state or community rises by 10 percent, its willingness to pay for environmental quality rises by 25 percent. And if a state's income falls 10 percent, this willingness to pay drops by 25 percent. On the basis of this comparative data, we can expect relatively prosperous regions to place greater emphasis on the health of the environment.</P><P>     How can we preserve the environment while continuing the economic progress that fosters environmental quality? One important key lies in preparing tomorrow's business leaders to be environmental managers. Harry E. Teasley, president and CEO of Coca-Cola/Nestle International has noted &quot;After 20 years of interviewing MBAs, I have concluded that most are well trained in the functional areas of finance, accounting and  marketing. These same students, however, have only a superficial or topical understanding of the relationship of business with the environment, the market economy, and public policy.&quot;</P><P>       The University of Washington addresses this problem with a new program to train future decision-makers attending the School of Business. The Environmental Management (EM) Program for MBA students, was established by people who anticipated that the environment would be a high priority on the national agenda and who understand the link between prosperity, environmental concern, and the ability to effectively address this concern.</P><P>     Major universities scattered throughout the United States are developing environmental MBA programs. What makes the University of Washington's effort unique is its emphasis upon market incentives and entrepreneurial innovations.</P><P>        As Dean Leventhal of the Business School notes, &quot;The environmental courses in most business schools are often taught by people who identify with the corporate guilt/social responsibility/command-and-control schools of thought. While we fully consider regulatory approaches to environmental management, our EM Program stresses property rights and market incentives as keys to harmonizing business and the environment.&quot;</P><P>       According to Professor Jonathan Karpoff, Director of the EM Program, the curriculum is built on three intellectual perspectives:</P><P>       --  The &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; made famous by ecologist Garrett Hardin, applies to many of today's environmental problems, such as atmospheric pollution;</P><P>     --  The prosperity that comes from successful, productive businesses fosters the achievement of environmental goals;</P><P>     --  Successful environmental policy must include not only regulation, but also market-oriented incentive-based approaches, such as the use of tradeable permits to curb pollution.</P><P>     Sue Mecklenburg, associate director of the EM Program, explains that it &quot;is designed to teach students how to use the current knowledge of environmental concerns to make better business decisions for both their company and the world. And this July, a week-long seminar at the University of Washington will give today's business executives an overview of environmental management principles.</P><P>     Vice president-elect Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, previews the new political climate under which businesses must operate. Fortunately, some politicians are beginning to understand environmental economics; specifically that environmental concern and the ability to effectively address that concern are dependent upon prosperity.</P><P> ____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           First of a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  IN the fifth grade I started a conservation club for my school. To me, the U.S. Forest Service epitomized conservation and stewardship. Rangers maintained trails, practiced ecology, and found lost hikers while Smokey the Bear admonished us to put out our campfires and appreciate the outdoors.</P><P>     But today we hear that behind the popular symbols is an agency that suffers predictable bureaucratic and political pathologies. We learn that the Forest Service, once a symbol of good government, actually fosters waste and environmental destruction.</P><P>     The Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1905. He initially promised that after a &quot;modest&quot; investment by Congress, the forests would pay for themselves. That has never been true because Forest Service decisions have always been biased by political pressures and budgeting. The deceptions have multiplied to the point that a group of disgruntled employees have set up a watchdog group, the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics (AFSEEE). Its members critique and seek reform of Forest Service policies.</P><P>     The thrust of their, criticism, and that of others, is this: 109 of 122 of the National Forests lose money on their timber sale programs. In doing so they sacrifice the environment and non-timber values of the land. Alaska's Tongass National Forest exemplifies these problems.</P><P>     The Tongass is the largest National Forest, encompassing 16.9 million, acres. It is best known for its temperate old-growth rain forest. This ecosystem has a diverse understory of plants and brush, which provides habitat for bears, owls and wolves, as well as a variety of landmarks including Admiralty Island National Monument.</P><P>     Through massive subsidies, the Tongass is a large supplier of pulp wood and saw timber. While stumpage in the Northwest sells for hundreds of dollars per thousand board feet, in the Tongass it brings under $10 per thousand. Yet the costs of simply administering the timber sales and building the roads is about $56 per thousand. Absent the subsidy, private companies could not harvest such timber. But with the Forest Service footing the bulk of the bill, they do.</P><P>     In the 1950s the Forest Service signed two 50-year contracts to provide logs from the Tongass for two local mills. These contracts oblige the Forest Service to provide highly subsidized timber, up to 300 million board/feet per year, solely to keep the two mills in business. This is regardless of cost, market conditions or the ability of the Tongass to regenerate the timber. So far, over eight billion board feet of timber has been cut and sold for a loss.</P><P>     Under the contracts, the mills are also able to request &quot;emergency rate redeterminations&quot; of contract prices if the market price of milled lumber is inadequate to ensure  profitability. Thus, the mills are assured of a profit. The Tongass returned over $15 million dollars to the mills in 1991 as a refund for &quot;overpayment&quot; in previous years.</P><P>     And, of course, as environmentalists point out, the Forest Service ignores many of logging's cost. Habitat destroyed. Streams and spawning beds silted up by runoff. Sublime forests clearcut. This harms both wildlife and local economies. Healing may take decades.</P><P>     Recently, the Forest Service asked some of its biologists to report on such impacts in the Tongass. The biologists concluded that numerous species would be displaced unless logging were scaled back. But the biologists' supervisors saw a threat to budgets dependent upon timber harvests. They suppressed the report. This is the bureaucratic logic of the former Soviet Union - and the resultant problems are similar.</P><P>     The well-intentioned people of AFSEEE have not been able to change the Forest Service. I have known many people, including some of my best students, who have gone on to work for the Forest Service. Yet little changes. Why do basically good people do bad things?</P><P>       The answer is that with bad incentives, good intentions will not suffice. And the &quot;Forest Soviet's&quot; bureaucratic imperatives continually filter out threatening information. Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It, describes these responses in his last book, Young Men and Fire, telling of Forest Service cover-ups and obfuscation in the deaths of 12 Smokejumpers in a 1949 forest fire.</P><P>     This same process inhibits evolutionary responses to our increasing knowledge of forest ecology and America's changing tastes and values. To prevent such episodes, fundamental reform is required. Personnel changes are not enough. Newcomers will face the same political pressures and antiquated structures. The goals of ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency have yet to be achieved by government bureaucracy.</P><P>     Without proper incentives, reform will fail. There is hope. It lies with alternatives based upon new ways to use property rights and market incentives. With them, we can harmonize economical timber production with environmental goals.</P><P>_______________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           Second in a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  BROCK Evans, vice president and chief lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, recently spoke at a University of Washington Environmental Management Seminar. In response to a question about reforming the Forest Service, he cataloged many destructive, wasteful and insensitive practices. Below-cost timber sales were high on his list of government boondoggles. We agree on these failings.</P><P>     His cure was familiar too: replace the &quot;bad&quot; people in the Forest Service with new, &quot;good&quot; people; and instill the Forest Service with a new corporate culture that respects environmental values, placing them ahead of logging and exploitation. Here our opinions diverge.</P><P>     I believe there are few bad people in the Forest Service, certainly no more than in any large government organization. What dooms the Forest Service are its bad budgetary incentives.</P><P>     As Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, put it, &quot;It's the budget that energizes the Forest Service.&quot; And the Forest Services' budgeting process is fundamentally perverse. It provides incentives to generate below-cost timber sales and to discount the value of recreation, wildlife habitat and environmental amenities.</P><P>     In the private sector, business income must cover expenditures. But the Forest Service does not run like that - and it cannot go bankrupt. An obscure 1930 law called the Knutson-Vandenburg Act is important to the budgeting process. Under it, the Forest Service is allowed to keep the revenue from its timber sales while timber sale costs are funded by Congressional appropriation.</P><P>     In 1930 it cost the Forest Service 50 cents per thousand board feet to hold a timber sale. So the Forest Service wrote a rule specifying that 50 cents be returned to the Treasury for every thousand board feet. The 50-cents rule still applies - but today the average sale costs over $50 per thousand board feet.</P><P>     So while the taxpayer pays a timber sale's costs (overhead, planning, road construction, etc.), the Forest Service keeps the bulk of the proceeds. There is virtually no direct connection between income and expense. And if the Forest Service is the budget maximizer its chief suggests, the incentive is to maximize timber sale volume, not net value, and therefore receipts. In this way the Forest Service's budget will rise once when Congress appropriates sale funds and then again when sale receipts are received.</P><P>     As a result, according to forest economist Randal O'Toole, 90 percent of our national forests lose money on their timber-sale programs. This costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</P><P>     There is another reason why so many sales occur: There are 122 National Forests in 40 states. The Treasury is required to pay 25 percent of the proceeds of each timber sale to local communities. Congressmen put political pressure on the Forest Service to hold sales in their districts, seeking to funnel dollars back home. Tellingly, Puerto Rico (with no vote in Congress) has the only national forest without a timber-sale program.</P><P>     Congress often passes Forest Service appropriation bills specifying harvest levels, often above even what the Forest Service recommends. These timber sales are pork barrel projects. Over time this creates communities dependent upon Forest Service welfare. As people developed stakes in this system, meaningful reform became increasingly difficult.</P><P>     We can see why the Forest Service hosts so many below-cost sales. They provide its life blood, money, as well as a pipeline for Congressional pork. Not that all Forest Service personnel are willing accomplices in a grand scheme to defraud the taxpayer. Why are &quot;good&quot; managers so often captured and co-opted by this budgeting process? Below-cost timber sales provide funding to support the Forest Service's other work, like habitat management.</P><P>     But the result is that the taxpayer gets nothing for something, subsidizing clearcuts that are seldom environmentally friendly. Al Gore states in his book Earth in the Balance, &quot;As the world's leading exemplar of free-market economics, the U.S. has a special obligation to discover effective ways of using the power of market forces to help save the environment.&quot; Market approaches to Forest Service problems can illuminate reform. We can recognize the advantages of private sector timber management. It strives for efficiency. Private firms harvest only timber that can pay its way out of the woods. Concurrently, we recognize the need to develop the environmental sensitivity of private firms.</P><P>     If the Forest Service is to salvage its reputation, it must move toward economic responsibility. The elimination of incentives to hold below-cost sales is a good first step. Make the Forest Service fund timber sales only out of net timber sale receipts. No more incentives to lose money, and no incidental environmental harm in the bargain. Only good people and good incentives can fix the Forest Service.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           MANY recreationalists bristle at the prospect of recreation fees on our national forests. Why should we pay to hike on &quot;our&quot; land? They are outraged, however, when they encounter clear-cuts near timberline on these same lands. But if they could choose between recreation fees and timber cutting, might fees then be accepted as the lesser of two evils?</P><P>        The reason for clear-cuts is, as you might expect, money. The Forest Service budget increases with every timber sale. Specifically, with every board-foot that it sells, the Forest Service generates income from Congress and lumber companies. The more it sells, the bigger its budget. Recreation and aesthetic interests, however, return few dollars to the Forest Service budget. How can they compete with timber when decisions are made by budget-maximizing managers?</P><P>       Congress' answer has been the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. It states that Forest Service management should give equal weight to &quot;outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.&quot; In practice, it means that creative Forest Service planners suddenly discover that recreation and environmental benefits are produced by logging. For example, new roads into pristine wilderness areas improve access while clear-cuts provide increased &quot;edge&quot; habitat for forest animals. Congressional multiple-use mandates are thus trumped by budgetary incentives.</P><P>     So multiple use fails because budgetary pressures for logging and grazing need not compete with revenue from recreation. Recreation fees can level the playing field and guarantee that non-timber values are considered. Revenues from biking, hiking, and camping in the national forests can provide monetary incentives for land managers to consider non-timber values. If they do not consider such values, they will sacrifice income. And as timber shows, income speaks.</P><P>     The Forest Service estimates that the market value of national forest recreation is over $5 billion per year. A more modest estimate by forest economist Randal O'Toole, using a recreation fee average of only $3 per day, is $1 billion per year. Even so, O'Toole estimates that such recreation fees would outweigh timber receipts on 80 percent of the national forests. So recreation can compete. With fees, eight of ten national forests, those ill-suited for commercial timber production, would see little timber cutting. And even on the truly productive forests, cutting would likely be more sensitive as managers sought to maintain some recreation income.</P><P>     Fees would come from day permits and annual passes. Enforcement would occur by making permits visible, either on vehicles or a ski-lift type tag. Similar methods work well with fishing licenses, in national forest campgrounds, and in Washington State Sno-Parks.</P><P>     Equity is a concern. But if the poor were asked which free goods and services they would most like, would hiking and camping make the top ten? When considered relative to outdoor equipment and transportation costs, fees fade to insignificance.</P><P>     But the benefits of such fees would be substantial. Timber cutting on our national forests should occur only when timber values exceed those values lost to logging. Fees would help ensure this result. Much less would be cut, and that which was cut would likely be more sensitive to aesthetic and recreation values. We would also have a rational means for evaluating recreation - timber trade-offs.</P><P>     This would also change the incentives faced by private forest managers. When our national forests give away recreation, private managers cannot compete. But when national forests charge fees, private land may open up to recreation, also for a fee. Private landowners, who currently can only profit from timber sales, would have an alternative source of revenue and increased reasons to act with sensitivity toward the land.</P><P>     Such private sector incentives are important because much private land has non-timber value. Recreation fees encourage landowners to recognize such value and preserve their lands. And by reducing the cut from marginal timber sites on our national forests, we will foster more careful management of private commercial forests, most of which are biologically better suited for timber production.</P><P>     Recreation on public lands is similar to timbering or livestock grazing in that each use affects other opportunities. There is a cost measured in other uses foregone. This &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of using the national forests for recreation is often some foregone logging or grazing. Without recreation fees, it is no contest. Logging and grazing revenues win. With fees, logging will face the opportunity costs of lost recreation income.</P><P>     While the Forest Service has a multiple-use mandate, it faces a dominant-use incentive. True multiple use implies multiple incentives. Recreation fees will help to level the playing field and protect our national forests for the uses we most value.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THERE is much talk today about &quot;reinventing government.&quot; The goal is to both improve outcomes and save dollars. The Forest Service is an excellent candidate for such reforms.  </P><P>      The Forest Service's creators are credited with high ideals, but America's sylvan socialism has suffered the liabilities of socialism elsewhere. The Forest Service was created because of an expectation of timber famine. Since then, the Forest Service has predicted five timber famines (which have yet to materialize) and used these threats to expand its prominence, power and funding.</P><P>     And while it is true that there is a scarcity of undisturbed ecosystems, there is no scarcity of wood fiber. There are three reasons why. First, the U.S. began with a huge inventory of mature timber for harvest at low cost. Second, the private sector manages productive timber sites well. Third, we've had great technical innovation. When dealing with commodities in a market economy, scarcity has yet to win a race against creativity.</P><P>     In sum, the Forest Service is not, and has never been, essential to a secure timber supply. It was a well-intended but misguided response to both real and imagined problems.</P><P>     Forest Service reform can serve two purposes: to increase the ecological sensitivity with which the land is treated and to increase the efficiency with which the forests are managed. Forest Service atrocities have been documented in detail: streams silted up, giant sequoias leveled, habitat destroyed, billions of dollars wasted. Years of reform attempts have had no great effect. The Forest Service's size and the bureaucratic imperative of budgetary growth have thwarted attempts to induce fiscal or environmental responsibility.</P><P>     We want our most productive national forests to be as efficient as private commercial forests while respecting environmental values. To achieve these ends we suggest nothing radical. Rather, to reinvent those national forests best suited to commercial timber, we should carefully and with environmental sensitivity sell them to the highest bidders over a 20-year period. Here's how.</P><P>     Our national forests fall into three categories: productive commercial forests, inherently unproductive forests on high, dry, and cold sites, and those forests which, depending upon technology and timber prices, fall somewhere in between.</P><P>     Trees like to grow where it is warm, wet and low. These are the most productive forests, suitable for commercial timber. Few of our 122 national forests, perhaps one-third at most, have these features. The Forest Service runs them essentially as commercial forests. They are roaded. They have been logged and are on harvest rotations. They are distinguished from private forests largely by inefficiency and the political influence on management. These lands are candidates for sale.</P><P>     Incentives to produce timber efficiently and cheaply are far stronger in the private sector than in the government sector. And deed restrictions can ensure that the environmental values of these lands are better protected than on either traditional private forests or the national forests.</P><P>     For example, riparian areas can be protected by buffer zones. Conservation easements can provide recreation areas. Restrictive covenants can protect against commercial development. Ecologically critical areas, such as elk calving grounds, can also be protected through deed restrictions.</P><P>     Companies like Champion International might manage such lands. Such firms know how to grow trees efficiently and effectively. Firms like Champion also have experience managing land for both recreation and timber. In Western Washington, they manage lands to increase deer habitat. This has resulted in both healthy deer herds and profitable timber. The lands are also managed for recreationalists who pay modest fees for access.</P><P>     Private ownership is no panacea. There is no one perfect system and no costless solution. We seek arrangements in which individuals have incentives to act in the public interest. The system we propose fosters recreation and aesthetic uses of the land and efficient timber production.</P><P>     And importantly, the taxpayer will no longer be forced to pay for poor Forest Service management practices. The financial responsibility would be with taxpaying timber companies while opportunities for political meddling and pork-barrel politics are reduced. Such conjunctions of sound economics and ecological stewardship can be a basis for &quot;reinventing government.&quot;</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE Shoshone National Forest near Dubois, Wyo., is an important part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. But the forest has maintained a money-losing logging program. In any rational system, the ecological, recreation, watershed and wildlife values would easily trump logging in the Shoshone.</P><P>       Even the purely economic cost of logging the Shoshone exceed the benefits. In 1991, for example, the Forest Service lost $557,000 on the Shoshone while selling 13,000,000 board feet of timber. If we include road and other associated costs, some of which the Forest Service ignores entirely, the losses go up to $1,857,000. Since timber likes to grow where it's warm, wet and low, and the Shoshone is high, dry and cold, these losses cannot be corrected by more efficient management. Rather, fundamental reform is in order. A recent event inspires such reform.</P><P>       Stephen Gordon ranches near the Shoshone and grazes cattle on its lands. He recently sent the Forest Service a $100,000 check as a down payment for rights to a timber sale in the Shoshone's Brent Creek drainage. But with rights to the timber he would keep it standing, not cut it. He pledged an additional $200,000 and agreed to replenish his federal grazing permits in favor of wildlife. Further, to benefit wildlife habitat, he offered to donate a conservation easement on his ranch to the government. All this if only the Forest Service would agree to forgo a money-losing sale.</P><P>     Both the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service urged the Forest Service not to cut the drainage, saying that it is a critical migration corridor for elk and important to the Yellowstone grizzly population.</P><P>     But the Forest Service returned Gordon's check. It did not offer an economic rationale for rejecting his offer. Nor did it dispute that the area was critical wildlife habitat. District Ranger Brent Larson replied that Gordon proposed &quot;creation of a de facto wilderness area. We can't do that.&quot; The Forest Service saw their multiple-use mission as requiring that they provide logs to local mills even when other values are much higher.</P><P>     The Forest Service budget is increased when it interprets multiple use as a mandate to lose money and sacrifice habitat. It has become a parasitic bureaucracy. Its arcane budgeting and decision-making process are governed by a political calculus that dominates economic and ecological standards.</P><P>     Can we imagine new institutional arrangements that are sensitive to changing values and open to scientific findings? Could we design an organization that would responsibly weigh the costs and benefits of alternative actions? Can we accommodate offers like Gordon's?</P><P>       When dealing with political economy, we should separate hopes from expectations. With this cautionary note, I propose that we build upon our centuries of common-law experience and create a Shoshone Biodiversity Trust. Like a museum, nonprofit hospital or private college, the trust would be run by a board of trustees, respected and knowledgeable volunteers who accept fiduciary responsibility. The trust's sole purpose would be to manage the former national forest land, land that did not support a viable timber industry but was logged at a loss due to political pressures.</P><P>     Environmental scientists and local, regional and national leaders could comprise the board. The trust would be granted a charter by Congress and would have to act within the confines of this charter, obeying previously established wilderness designations and protecting proscribed riparian areas. Beyond that, it would be free to set its own course.</P><P>     Each forest endowment board would run solely on its own revenues. No more federal handouts. Each would have access to a full array of income-generating mechanisms: grazing permits, recreation fees, gifts and even timber sales where they made economic and ecological sense. The board would return 25 percent of revenue from recreation or commodities to counties and local communities, just as the Forest Service now does.</P><P>       The remainder could be used in any way that furthered the trust's mission. It could study wildlife populations, maintain trails, buy more land or buy winter range for wildlife. If this experiment is successful it may be replicated on other forests. Some would likely promote intensive recreation uses, such as mountain biking, while others might focus on primitive recreation and wilderness areas.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship exists in the nonprofit as well as the for-profit world, The Nature Conservancy and the North American Elk Foundation are highly successful examples. These organizations creatively respond to new interests and understandings. A Shoshone Biodiversity Trust can follow their lead. With such trusts we can better preserve shared values, allowing each forest to fulfill its mission and maintain its ecological endowment.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IN every language the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; bears a crust of derision.</P><P> This is no accident, for bureaucratic incentives invariably produce problems. Bureaucracies tend to replace the goals that justified their creation with actions that protect their budgets. The good news is that we can harness this fatal propensity in a way that will improve government and reduce its costs. While our plan won't do it all, here is a beginning.</P><P>     President Clinton's appeal for mutual sacrifice in the form of higher taxes and foregone benefits have been well-received. Our new president is an excellent political salesman. And many Americans are sufficiently responsible to be willing to buy the goods. But if special interests undermine success, citizens will feel betrayed.</P><P>     Here is a decision rule for such budget-cutting: Programs that are both economically wasteful and environmentally destructive will be zeroed out. Logging subsidies and most new Bureau of Reclamation water projects fall in this category. But that is not enough. Cuts must go deeper, to the myriad &quot;demonstration&quot; projects and special initiatives that riddle every appropriations bill.</P><P>     In the abstract, cutting spending is appealing. Most people feel that much of their tax bill is wasted by the government. But specific programs that benefit special interests have strong supporters. In contrast, few taxpayers have an incentive to lobby against specific programs; the portion of their tax bill going to any item other than entitlements is quite small. The average citizen has little incentive to become active while the beneficiaries have strong reasons to fight for their programs.</P><P>       This problem is the classic one of &quot;factions&quot; that so concerned Madison and the founders of our nation. The temptation of politicians to concentrate benefits and disperse costs has been the ruin of democracy through the ages. As we became a society based upon transfer payments, government was transformed from an agency of order to an engine of plunder.</P><P>     So in addition to dealing honestly with entitlements, how can we cut major chunks from the federal budget? The accumulated programs that have led to our crisis develop strong and stable constituencies. Such programs are best headed off in their infancy. One way is to create a government agency that draws funding solely from successful attempts to eliminate and pare back both existing and newly proposed government programs; let's consider a predatory bureaucracy.</P><P>     The Bureau of Reclamation proposed rebuilding the Teton Dam, a structure that failed when first filled in 1976. This dam had damaging ecological consequences and the economic costs far outweighed the economic benefits. Yet interests, such as those who expected to benefit from subsidized irrigation, lobbied for it.</P><P>     A predatory agency would marshal its resources against this project, employing ecologists, economists, and local residents who like the river as it is. They would advertise these costs to Congress. If the dam were cut, our predatory bureaucracy would receive 1 percent of the project's estimated costs and the Bureau of Reclamation's operating budget would decrease by the same 1 percent. The predatory bureaucracy would thus thrive only if it were successful at eliminating programs, and the offending department, in this case the Bureau of Reclamation, would be punished not only by losing this project, but by losing an additional portion of its budget.</P><P>     This system would provide incentives for government to police itself against waste and pork barrel projects, both by the predator and the prey, as projects are weeded out in anticipation of attack by the predator agency. Such a department could be established with a single two-year appropriation. After the first two years, it would exist solely upon funds gleaned from cut programs. Its size would vary just as predator numbers follow the size of prey populations.</P><P>     The proposal is not without its drawbacks. I find the creation of another bureaucracy somewhat offensive but this is a problem of political economy, not political theology where sin is well-defined. It is also possible that some worthwhile projects might be killed. But the real question is whether the benefits outweigh the costs. And on this score, it is likely to be quite successful.</P><P>     The fundamental logic behind this proposal is that bureaucracies are driven by their budgets. Just as corporations are driven to seek profits, government agencies seek to maximize their budget. They normally do this by pleasing a special-interest clientele. Our proposal would utilize that insight by creating an agency which, to increase its budget, would cannibalize the unsound proposals of other bureaucracies. In doing so it would foster the public interest rather than special interests.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

This provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1958. It bans any additive in any detectable levels in processed food if the additive has been shown to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals.</P><P>       The law seems to make sense. Who wants a cancer-causing substance added to their food? But its broadly stated mandate does not reflect today's scientific knowledge and our growing awareness of health risks.</P><P>     The Delaney Clause is subject to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC charged, accurately, that the EPA was failing to enforce the Delaney Clause. It was, because EPA realized that it was an unworkable law that does more to threaten our nation's health than help it. However, a California judge ordered EPA to follow the law.</P><P>     The EPA's response to the decision was twofold: It began to list the chemicals that would be banned if it were forced to follow the letter of the law and it asked Congress to amend the law to reflect current scientific understanding.</P><P>     The scientific problems are many. Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer our modern techniques of testing substances for cancer effects. He is now among the methods' chief critics. He cites two concerns.</P><P>     The first has to do with the testing method of feeding populations of animals the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a chemical, the dose just below that which causes death. After exposure the animals are examined for cancerous growths.</P><P>     The problem is that the &quot;dose-response&quot; curve is unlikely to be linear, that is, continuous high exposures are likely to be more dangerous than long-term low exposures. A substance's ability to cause cancer at 50 or 5000 times the average daily intake level may tell us nothing about its effect upon cancer risk at smaller, more likely doses. As a government scientific panel announced in the Federal Register, &quot;the implicit assumptions underlying extrapolations from the MTD . . . do not appear to be valid.&quot;</P><P>       The second problem is transferring lab results on mice to human populations. Mice and rats are more closely related to one another than to humans. However, one will often test negative while the other will test positive for the same chemical.</P><P>     Dr. Ames also points out that it is not only man-made substances that cause cancer. Using the same disputed techniques, he found a variety of other naturally occurring chemicals, present in substances from peanut butter to broccoli, that also cause cancer in test animals.</P><P>     In contrast to what was believed when Delaney was passed, experts today believe that, aside from workers who are exposed to massive doses, not more than 1-3 percent of cancer cases can be attributed to man-made chemicals. The vast majority are due to genetics and lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or fatty foods.</P><P>     Of course, to those who campaign for public health, 3 percent is still too much. But they lose sight of the fact that relative, not absolute, risk is the important measure. Most chemicals are present for a reason. They help to control pests and bacteria. They lengthen shelf life. All act in ways that reduce the price of food and often the real danger associated with eating it. The result of strict enforcement of Delaney would likely be greater scarcity of some foods, price increases, and increased likelihood of contamination.</P><P>     The environment might also suffer as more harmful substances are used. In Wisconsin, for example, farmers would likely switch to copper- or tin-based compounds to protect their potato crops from blight. Ultimately, this practice would poison their soils with the accumulation of heavy metals.</P><P>     So by banning pesticides, we may increase other risks, shifting dangers elsewhere. But we cannot eliminate all risks, only choose intelligently among them. This requires a careful analysis of relative risks, not legislation where emotions trump science.</P><P>     EPA's suggestion to relax Delaney is likely to face a tough battle in Congress. Few senators and representatives want to be portrayed as voting for cancer. Cancer is complex, emotional, and scary. And certainly we should seek to lower cancer risks when reasonable. But it is relative risks, what happens on the margins, that matter. To promote a safe and affordable food supply, lets be alert to environmental hyperbole and posturing while respecting medical science and the economics of risk reduction. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           WHEN considering the proposed &quot;Ancient Forest Summit&quot; or &quot;Timber Summit&quot; (word choice is significant), we should carefully segregate our hopes from our expectations. Yet I'm hopeful that the summit will increase understanding and improve policy. Here's why.</P><P>       Twenty years ago my colleagues and I at Montana State University advocated market incentives and property rights as environmental tools. Few considered this a viable option. Environmentalists and journalists considered us &quot;the wild bunch of Montana.&quot; We were the academic analogs of gunslingers and cowboys.</P><P>     But today this emphasis on incentives is becoming mainstream. Many environmental leaders who once considered pollution sin against nature (and as such immune from economic analysis) now favor market incentives to control it. However, the concept of private property rights has not gained this acceptance. In fact, property rights are under siege. The April summit could be decisive in this struggle of ideas.</P><P>     Environmental regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, often threaten property rights. They constrain land-use options, reducing income and land value. Few owners are indifferent to this outcome - especially when they are not compensated for their lost opportunities. Here in the Northwest with our high timber values and spotted owl controversies, the situation is especially dramatic.</P><P>     The problem with the spotted owl is primarily one of scale. It is not just a golf course or a shopping mall that is being challenged by an endangered species. If we were to protect the 900 or so owl circles in Washington, 1.5 million acres of land would be restricted from logging. Clearly, owl circles dramatically threaten the property rights of many landowners. This impact is significant. As an estimate, enough lumber to build 3.5 million homes would be withheld.</P><P>     America's founders understood the importance of secure property rights. They saw how people in other times and other lands used the government to transfer wealth. To help preclude this they gave us the Fifth Amendment's clause, &quot;. . .  nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation  . . .&quot; They designed our laws and regulations to encourage productive, rather than predatory, activities.</P><P>     Environmentalists sometimes favor regulations that strip value from property. Taking seems cheaper than buying. It isn't. Actions have unintended consequences. When property rights are threatened, behavior changes. People lose incentives to be good stewards of their land. They have incentives to &quot;cut out and get out.&quot; This process is evident on the timber lands of Western Washington, Oregon and California; people fearing land-use regulations understandably act before they lose opportunities to do so.</P><P>     Friends often tell me, &quot;We can't afford to pay for the environments we must save.&quot; But if voters lack the taste and understanding to pass bonds to buy lands for environmental preservation, are we to impose our tastes and &quot;take&quot; land by regulation? Ethically, can we impose our values upon others, even for a &quot;good&quot; cause? When should individual choice and freedom be sacrificed to environmental ends? The answers are seldom obvious.</P><P>     Some who testify at the summit are likely to justify uncompensated takings with environmental appeals. Before accepting such views, I suggest we consider ecologist Garrett Hardin's question: &quot;And then what?&quot; Much of what follows from threats of takings can be anticipated - e.g., cutting timber before it's &quot;taken&quot; by regulation. The &quot;Shoot, shovel, and shut-up&quot; approach to endangered species is another reaction to these threats of takings.</P><P>     I hope the summit will explain how we can move toward a harmony of environmental protection and private property rights. Secure property rights are essential to liberty, they foster prosperity, and promote environmental health. These values are interdependent.</P><P>     Rather than increase the threat of regulation, environmentalists at the summit should help private landowners realize the ecological values of their lands. Conservation easements, endowment funds for endangered species, and recreation user fees are all based upon property rights. We have a host of mechanisms that allow and encourage individuals to express their environmental concern with economic means. The summit can identify, publicize and promote them.</P><P>     I suggest that while our hopes for the summit are bountiful, our expectations should be spare. Political management has been with us for many years and people are accustomed to it. In the late 1800's, the Progressive Era reformers identified serious problems with America's environment. Unfortunately, their diagnosis of causes was flawed. Their reforms promoted bureaucratic, command-and-control resource management. The results were often disastrous.</P><P>     Nearly a century later a new group of &quot;progressives&quot; is again addressing these problems. We can expect better solutions only if President Clinton and others understand the possibilities and the limits of both property rights and bureaucratic approaches. As we await the summit, please keep your hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE RECENT forest conference in Portland was, as expected, both well-attended and highly publicized. The scene, however, was more impressive than was the substance. Virtually nothing was resolved.</P><P>       Unfortunately, this is a predictable consequence of political decision-making. And the conference's politicking and posturing overshadowed that week's true environmental milestone: the inaugural sale of pollution rights by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     Economists had long awaited this event. It initiated an efficient strategy to reduce pollution from powerplants and factories.</P><P>     The theory is straightforward: Government sets an acceptable overall emissions level for a pollutant, in this case the sulfur dioxide emitted by electrical utilities and factories. It then creates tradable permits and gets out of the way to let the market process produce the best way to achieve the reductions.</P><P>     From 1995 onward, industrial plants must have an allowance to emit sulfur dioxide. The government grants pollution allowances to plants based upon their emissions history. For example, those which emitted an average of 100 tons over the past four years were given grandfathered permits for 75 tons in 1995. (The amount drops to 50 tons in the year 2000.) Each grandfathered permit was subtracted from the national emissions limit. The remainder were then auctioned to the highest bidder by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     This system has highly positive environmental and economic implications. First, it encourages utilities to find the most efficient way to comply with the law. They may either buy permits at auction or find money-saving ways to cut emissions. A highly successful plant may be able to cut emissions for less than the going price of an emissions permit. It can then cut pollution further, selling or retiring its extra permits.</P><P>     The result is a market which provides incentives for innovative pollution-control techniques. The emitters with the lowest cost of control will reduce their emissions the most. Those who find ways to emit less save money, just what our environmentally conscious nation increasingly desires.</P><P>     The early results seem promising. Illinois Power Company expects to save at least $250 million over the next 20 years by buying permits as opposed to building a new scrubber. But this is not an increase in pollution. Rather, it is a transfer, for a utility somewhere must now emit less. So Illinois ratepayers save money, the nation moves toward its emissions goals, and the government raises revenues by selling permits.</P><P>     In future years the total number of permits offered, and hence the amount of pollution, will be reduced. Illinois Power will continually reassess its emissions costs and control strategies. It may even build a new scrubber. But the expectation is that, when faced with options and competitive pricing of permits, companies will find innovative, and less expensive, ways to reduce their own emissions. So we all get a cleaner environment at lower cost.</P><P>     And since anybody can bid on permits, the system also enables those who most value clean air to enter the market. At least one environmental group, National Healthy Air Exchange, bids on permits, hoping to buy and &quot;retire&quot; them.</P><P>     Northeast Utilities donated 10,000 tons of its 140,000-ton annual allowance to the American Lung Association. Eastern coal miners may buy some to package with their &quot;dirty,&quot; or high-sulfur, coal, and hence save their jobs.</P><P>     These are just some of the possibilities created by tradable permits. Environmental and business entrepreneurs will surely find more. This process unleashes the innovation and creativity which make markets such successful institutions.</P><P>     This sale also illustrates another advantage of market-based environmental solutions: The sale was not the lead story on the evening news. Market solutions promote adjustment and compromise without political grandstanding and public recriminations.</P><P>     In an honest market, there is no angling for a favorable exemption from clean-air laws, no political payoffs for special treatment. The market solves the social problem of distribution efficiently, at low cost and with minimum fuss.</P><P>     As President Clinton grapples with conflicts over old-growth forests, he should learn from the example offered by the Chicago Board of Trade. Markets can be harnessed to help the environment, perhaps through a national biodiversity trust fund which would buy habitat and development rights to important ecosystems.</P><P>     Our president may be the best political salesman in history. Surely if the Chicago Board of Trade can get people to buy pollution, President Clinton can devise ways to sell the spotted owl's recovery. </P><P>_____________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are selling the outlines of their health-care program to the nation. We have been told to expect many good things from it. Universal access, coverage of pre-existing conditions and expanded basic care would benefit many people. But it is likely that fully implementing a nationalized health-care plan will cost between $50 and $100 billion per year.</P><P>       Expanding access and coverage conflicts with the desire to trim the nation's health-care bill. But the president feels pressure to &quot;do something&quot; about costs of health care. The pharmaceutical industry is an obvious and tempting target.</P><P>     The drug industry is vulnerable to attack for several reasons. It has been consistently profitable, with returns as much as double those of the rest of manufacturing. Most prescription drug cost are paid directly by patients, making price increases immediately apparent. And the patent protection provided to new drugs creates an effective temporary monopoly, at least to the extent that a drug's properties are not duplicated by other drugs on the market.</P><P>     All of this makes drug companies an easy target for government intervention: Some people claim we need price controls to protect the consumer. And what consumer would not like drugs to be cheaper? (Even though prescription drugs account for only a nickel of every health-care dollar, and thus have only a small impact on overall health-care costs.) But more importantly, there are several good arguments as to why price controls would hurt, not help, consumers.</P><P>     Consumers care about more than just low prices. In the drug market especially, they are served by innovative new products with greater healing properties. That is the trade-off: prices versus innovation. We could have a constrained drug market with low prices and protracted negotiations between companies and the federal government over prices that may be charged for new drugs. But most people would prefer an innovative market with many new, and presumably more helpful, drugs.</P><P>     It is the profits on new, successful drugs that prompt the intensive research and development to find the next generation of miracle cures and therapies. New drugs are expensive to develop, costing an average of $231 million each in 1987. Of these, only three in 10 break even.</P><P>     So a successful drug must pay for its own research, as well as the research on the unsuccessful ones on which the company also risked money. In addition to the high emotions of illness, it is this risk and expense that make the drug industry so special. And the high risk explains why the government awards 14-year patents on new drugs. This gives the makers time to recoup their tremendous development expenditures before their research is copied and generic alternatives are offered.</P><P>     Price controls would take away the monopoly advantages of patent protection and undermine the incentives for research that patents were designed to provide. As an academic report on Medicaid and Medicare drug price controls not-so-succinctly put it, the revenue decline to drug companies resulting from price controls &quot;can be expected to negatively influence the expected returns on new drugs and to decrease the cash flow available to undertake R&amp;D.&quot;</P><P>        Price control enthusiasts will argue that it will be possible to hold down prices, but not so low that it undermines research. But this faith in the ability of regulators to control the market is not supported by our experience with regulation and price controls elsewhere. Medicaid and Medicare efforts to control the price of drugs and services caused cost-shifting to unregulated health-care payers. But industrywide price controls will prevent such shifting, leading to shortages and black markets.</P><P>     There were similar results during the Nixon-era price controls of 1971-74, as regulations and regulators multiplied while trying in vain to keep pace with the market's ability to circumvent price controls.</P><P>       As with the rest of the health-care program, we have only been told about the benefits of price controls on drugs. What is hidden are the harder-to-quantify but still real constraints upon innovation and new drug development.</P><P>       If we do not understand the logic driving the system we are likely to take well-intended actions that have perverse consequences. Unless we are sensitive to the importance of incentives to innovation, we can be sure that some important drugs will not be developed or introduced because of drug-price controls.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is clear from the argument of protectionists in Congress that many are pessimistic about the future of U.S. manufacturing. But recent events suggest prudent optimism, if not unconstrained joy.</P><P> While not all good things go together, some do. Economic understanding can help us find such unions.</P><P>     Environmental leaders show this improved understanding of economics. They are becoming aware that prosperity and environmental quality are complements, not competitors. The anti-business, anti-market, pro-regulatory rhetoric that marked the environmental movement in the 1970s and '80s is being replaced with an acceptance of markets and an appreciation of the advantages of decentralized decision-making.</P><P>       Only a few years ago, many environmental leaders held up the centralized and socialized economies of Eastern Europe as environmentally superior to the market economies of the West. After all, some had constitutional guarantees of environmental quality.</P><P>     But after the revolutions of 1989, the truth seeped out. Chernobyl was only the most graphic example. Even the most committed collectivists had to admit that the systems they championed were economically inefficient, environmentally destructive and thoroughly corrupting.</P><P>     Further, there is increased understanding that only with international trade can nations and regions realize their comparative advantages and increase prosperity through efficiency. This is especially true of poor nations: They have the most to gain from free-trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is such a step toward Mexican prosperity. The argument that NAFTA will harm Mexico's environment discounts an important fact. That is, as poor nations become wealthy their health and environmental standards rise. This holds across time and cultures: richer is cleaner, safer and more environmentally sensitive.</P><P>     Looking across the Mexican border, we simply cannot expect Third World nations to have the standards of first world nations. They have different priorities: food, shelter, clothing. We see horrifying examples of environmental health and safety violations. What would be truly extraordinary would be the absence of this difference. In my judgment, if NAFTA is passed, both the Mexican and U.S. economies will become more productive and Mexican environmental standards will rise toward ours. NAFTA will ultimately &quot;level&quot; both the environmental and wage playing fields with Mexico.</P><P>     And most importantly, American manufacturers are moving up the learning curve in efficiently dealing with environmental regulations. The Amoco Corporation recently conducted a major research project, cosponsored by EPA, at their Yorktown refinery. It was a thorough effort to investigate the costs and effectiveness of current pollution-control structures.</P><P>     The costs of pollution control are significant. That is why we see battles in Congress every time there is an attempt to raise environmental standards. A green world costs money. Our government should do its best to minimize these costs, but the Yorktown project shows that this is not the case.</P><P>       Yorktown was the first systematic attempt to assess all refinery emissions: air, water, soil - and to put a price tag on their control. Historically, EPA has monitored emissions only from selected points, like smoke stacks and containment pools. The Yorktown project found that these are not necessarily the areas which should be controlled. For example, large emissions came from the loading dock, a place EPA has never before checked.</P><P>     The bottom line: Amoco could achieve greater pollution reduction for about $11 million than it is getting for the $41 million in controls specified by EPA. When pollution control is inexpensive, we want a lot of it. When we must give up a lot to get it, we want less. Environmentalists are learning to favor efficient control because in the end it will mean less pollution.</P><P>     This &quot;second battle of Yorktown&quot; has revolutionary potential. It clearly demonstrates that the regulatory command-and-control approach employed to control industrial pollution is seriously flawed. Political incentives make government management costly and inefficient. Agencies should simply set goals and monitor results rather than specify process. The Yorktown Project shows that this is likely to save money and result in lower pollution levels - just as economics predicts.</P><P>     Although it would take a replication of the Yorktown work at many sites to obtain good estimates of potential national savings, the findings of Yorktown seem typical of manufacturing in general. In other words, American manufacturing has potential of meeting high environmental standards at a very substantial discount from today's costs.</P><P>       The lesson here is that while much of American industry can do well in the global marketplace, current government regulations are obsolete. If we are truly concerned about international competitiveness and losing jobs to low-cost foreign competitors, we should seek efficiency wherever possible - even in our environmental regulations. Fortunately, it seems we can do this without sacrificing our health and environmental standards. Amoco and EPA have shown us a beginning. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>            THE debate over old-growth forests pits preservationists against those depending on this timber for their livelihood. With each side committed to different uses of nature, conflict seems inevitable, for not all good things go together.</P><P>       This conflict is heightened by public ownership and political control. Special-interest groups are special precisely because they focus on their narrow interests, ignoring other costs and foregone opportunities to use or appreciate the land. If we are to resolve the old-growth conflict, we need to give people incentives to consider the preferences and tastes of others.</P><P>     Instead of continuing the failed, special-interest-dominated political management of old growth in national forests, consider what would happen if we gave the old growth to various environmental groups, e.g., the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society. This radical proposal would remove the forests from governmental politics and present the new land managers with strong incentives to preserve the values of old growth at the lowest possible cost.</P><P>     Let's consider such a transfer to be a real possibility.</P><P> Transferring ownership of old-growth areas to nonprofit corporations safeguards natural beauty and species diversity while offering opportunities for appropriate economic or recreational use. Unlike rangers and supervisors in the National Forests, private managers can balance these competing goods uninhibited by federal bureaucracies. Nonprofit managers will reap more of the benefits of good policies and bear more of the consequences of bad choices than do federal bureaucrats.</P><P>     If private owners damage a beautiful area by allowing destructive economic activities they will lose the aesthetic appeal of their land and the potential revenues from donors or recreational users. But if they choose to leave valuable natural resources untouched they must accept the loss of revenue that entails. Smoky's helpers are insulated from both losses.</P><P>     Many economic and recreational activities have little or no long-term environmental impact. Environmentally sensitive owners can choose these activities and generate revenue even as they regard nature. The Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary illustrates how private management follows these principles to harmonize conflicts among economic and ecological values.</P><P>     Rainey, a 26,800-acre marsh found near Intracoastal City, La., is owned by the Audubon Society and run for the benefit of the species it protects. What distinguishes Rainey from federal sanctuaries is the harmonious coexistence among wildlife, oil- and gas-drilling operations, and cattle grazing. Why does this work? Private management and sound science insulate managers from political processes that cause mischief on federal lands.</P><P>     Although oil wells and cattle are not usually associated with wildlife sanctuaries, at Rainey their presence makes sense. Royalties from oil and grazing fees from cattle provide Audubon revenue for operations, land acquisitions or improvements in existing land holdings.</P><P>     Drilling and grazing complement wildlife habitat on the preserve for two reasons. First, Rainey's managers seek to minimize environmental damage through restrictions on drilling during nesting seasons. Using careful timing, grazing, a notorious threat to wildlife on public lands, is an ecological tool. Second, those who wish to graze or drill have incentives to offer environmental sensitivity as well as high bids. In Rainey we see ecological entrepreneurship in action. Let's foster such innovations in the old growth of the national forests.</P><P>     Private, nonprofit land ownership avoids widespread subsidies to unprofitable logging, mining, and grazing. It is these subsidies that have created the West's most painful ecological disasters. Private ownership readily adapts to different times and places with innovative management techniques. For example, Rainey uses controlled burning to encourage growth of three-cornered grass that (snow) geese relish - a technique long disfavored on government lands. Finally, private ownership reduces the influence of perverse incentives leading to bureaucratic budgets, political vote buying, and time and money wasted on inconclusive political and legal battles.</P><P>     A lasting solution to the old-growth dilemma will require more than good intentions, lofty rhetoric, and admonitions for mutual respect. It will require shifting the management of environmental resources from public bureaucrats to private, often nonprofit, decision-makers. Political management inevitably makes policy the captive of special interests and science subject to politics. It gives bureaucracies license to mismanage, waste, and serve their perverse institutional goals.</P><P>     As a modest experiment, let's transfer 20 percent of the federal old growth to the environmental groups. They are far more likely than bureaucrats and politicians to find ways to make good things like prosperity and environmental quality go together.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           EACH June, at the end of the academic year, I head back to FREE's office in Bozeman, Mont., and spend the summer on a nearby ranch. I cannot imagine a better &quot;commute&quot; than between Seattle and the northern reaches of the Yellowstone ecosystem. On these drives I always recall John Steinbeck's suggestion that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. And I wonder how we can preserve these values.</P><P>       A hint comes from the recent Forbes magazine featuring Bill Gates. I respect Gates, not for his billions, but for his innovation and entrepreneurship. He has created value through a mix of intelligence, inspiration and force of will.</P><P>     Our environment needs such an entrepreneur, a person who can discover a new paradigm for recognizing those values, like biodiversity, which are outside today's market. But all too often there is no good link between our environmental values and large, bureaucratic institutions. Multimillion-dollar environmental groups lobby Congress for more laws while corporations lobby to resist.</P><P>     The losers in this environmental policy arena often end up in court in an effort to win what was lost in Congress. Environmental laws and backup bureaucracies slog along with unsatisfactory results. The options are discouraging.</P><P>     We need more innovation from small and quick organizations with site-specific information, and local as well as global concern. We need creative institutions whose leaders find ways to reach environmental values economically and economic values environmentally. Responsible liberty is a requisite to such success.</P><P>     Government can only do so much. It can change the rules of the game to the benefit of this group or that, but as the timber industry has learned, tides can quickly change. Since we can only rent - never buy - politicians, no battle is won, only prolonged. And government seldom creates. It seldom finds ways to make the pie larger, only different ways to cut it - often with a huge kerf in the form of overhead and inefficiency.</P><P>     From society's perspective, successful entrepreneurs are the</P><P> chefs who create new and better dishes from ingredients and combinations not previously seen or realized. They provide the closest thing we have to a free lunch, and they respond quickly to changing tastes and preferences.</P><P>     A small number of environmental entrepreneurs have long been with us. The Boone and Crockett Club, led by Teddy Roosevelt, was founded in 1887 by America's first conservationists.</P><P>     On my way to Montana I will pass near the club's recently established Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. The ranch's mission is to find ways in which wildlife and ranching can peacefully and productively coexist. It is to be a profitable ranch and a wildlife research center.</P><P>     If it is successful, and so far it seems to be, the ranch will be a model for others. By encouraging species to which many ranchers are hostile, and by succeeding, it can aid ecological balance throughout the West. Wolf reintroduction, for example, is unlikely to succeed if ranchers cannot manage their impact. My wife and I know from experience on our ranch how difficult predators can be. The Roosevelt Ranch may show ranchers how predators may be accommodated with minimal loss of livestock. If so, their presence surely would enhance the West.</P><P>     Closer to Seattle, The Village Conservancy is seeking new ways to insert environmentally sensitive housing into natural environments without diminishing those environments.</P><P>     A nonprofit group, the Conservancy seeks to bring landowners together to create low-impact communities in which individuals will have only minimal land for their homes while jointly owning surrounding acreage, which would be managed for aesthetic and conservation values. Such a trial project by The Village Conservancy for the North Fork Valley of Issaquah Creek was authorized recently by the King County Council.</P><P>     Governmental authorization of innovative land use is unusual and commendable. Such action implies intelligence and political courage.</P><P>     Environmental entrepreneurs produce social value by identifying new opportunities and motivating action. In this way, voluntary grass-roots cooperation fosters our environmental goals. The small associations envisioned by The Village Conservancy must, if they are to function effectively, be created by mutual consent and mutual interest. They are unlikely to be the solution for everyone.</P><P>     But with new options, like those envisioned by The Village Conservancy, the more likely we are to harmonize liberty, prosperity, and ecology.</P><P>     Whether it be integrating an old way of life with more recent environmental concerns, as on the Roosevelt Ranch, or creating new communities and associations centered around environment conservation with The Village Conservancy, environmental entrepreneurship shows its value.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

Twice in August we had snow at 6,500 feet. Our ranch is between Bozeman and Big Sky, Mont. Normal rainfall is just under 20 inches per year.</P><P> This year we had 14.5 inches in July. Hay wouldn't cure and the barley is still in the field. &quot;Where is global warming when we need it?&quot; was a common question, repeated over the summer as a series of visitors joined up in the Big Sky country.</P><P>     Despite this, our annual migration back to FREE's summer office was wonderfully rewarding. We worked hard, played hard and got the mix just right. FREE hosted a week-long seminar in environmental economics for academics and another, co-sponsored by the Environmental Management program at UW's Business School, for federal judges.</P><P>     We held several shorter programs for business leaders and environmental writers. A summer highlight was our annual &quot;seminar on wheels,&quot; a 407-mile bike trip from Yellowstone to Glacier national parks. (Economists call our team the FREE riders.) This was a seven-day exercise in stoic epicurism. We twice ground our way up the Continental Divide, Marias and Flesher passes, but as a result could indulge our appetites with impunity. Ah, the leisure of the theory class.</P><P>     Aside from the writers, few of our guests specialize in environmental matters. Most accepted conventional environmental perspectives and were surprised that I do not. &quot;How can you care about environmental quality and yet reject the `green' view?&quot; was a recurrent question, and &quot;Are you optimistic about Gore?&quot; another. Here are my answers.</P><P>     I believe that our vice president exemplifies the new public policy elite. He is sensitive, especially about the environment, ambitious, and confident of his superior knowledge of the way things really ought to be. When he ran for president in the spring of 1987, he saw global warming as a key campaign issue. His book, &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; deals with this issue. Gore's treatment of global warming illustrates the process and problems of his brand of environmentalism.</P><P>     &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; was on the New York Times bestseller list for 22 weeks. Why is this book so attractive to the new policy elite? And why do they ignore arguments that contradict Gore's apocalyptic assertion? Given the recurrent and predictable failures of bureaucratic, command-and-control environmental management, why do Gore and his followers neglect an environmentalism based upon property rights and the market process? Here's my hypothesis.</P><P>     Gore and the new elite specialize in abstract symbols, not material things. They don't get dirty or do heavy lifting. They don't experience the daily reality checks so familiar to most Americans, especially to people who sign payroll checks. The defining characteristics of Gore's peer group include intelligence and a dedication to politics. They seem confident in their ability to know what is good for other people - and quite willing to employ state coercion to enforce its realization. That is how they get things done.</P><P>     Global warming gives them justification to control other people's lives. From their standpoint, global warming is a special kind of environmental issue, for it has a huge political benefit. It gives policy-makers a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to constrain our liberty to act - e.g., by denying us safe, private vehicles. They want us to believe that the specter of global warming is so severe, the projected consequences so bad, that radical action is necessary. If global warming is both certain and dire, they can justify regulations to prevent this calamity. This is why Gore and others feel compelled to stifle debate and declare the issue decided. As they portray it, global warming gives rulers license to expand their rule.</P><P>     This summer I worked on FREE's upcoming book with the Pacific Research Institute of San Francisco, &quot;Balancing the Earth's Economy and Ecology.&quot; The contributors are a distinguished lot, and they deal with the philosophic and scientific issues of &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; Some argue that severe global warming is unlikely. And even if some global warming occurs, some consequences will surely be beneficial. On balance, we can't tell.</P><P>     But whether the subject is global warming or deforestation, environmental problems are complex and highly emotional. Good data and clear thinking are required to deal with them. As Gore says in &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; &quot;. . . to exclude inconvenient facts from the calculation of what is good and what is bad is a form of dishonesty&quot; (p. 188). Sensitive and sound environmental understanding is too important for truth to be gored by a collectivist ideology and a quest for governmental control.</P><P>     This is a theme of my Winter Quarter course, &quot;Business and the Environment: the Political Economy of Environmental Policy&quot; (BA 590). Although it's a Business School offering, students from all over the university take it, as do a few townspeople.</P><P>     Some of my lectures become columns. I invite you to follow my Wednesday columns. I welcome your suggestions of topics. The quality of our environment is important enough to merit our most careful and honest consideration.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           DEFENDERS of Wildlife is a national environmental group devoted to the protection of wildlife and the restoration of habitat. For years, Defenders strongly advocated the regulatory approach to species protection. But they now realize the limitations of regulations, particularly when dealing with private landowners. This October, they published a collection of essays titled &quot;Building Economic Incentives into the Endangered Species Act.&quot; The collection features incentive-based approaches to species preservation.</P><P>       Dayton Hyde has also learned the importance of incentives - negative incentives. Hyde is a rancher, conservation writer, and the founder of Operation Stronghold, a private wildlife-conservation group. He created a lake and new wildlife habitat on his ranch, attracting a variety of species including bald eagles. For his efforts, state and federal agencies increasingly regulated his operation.</P><P>     For a time, the Forest Service actually restricted him from entering his property by truck, claiming he might disturb the eagles.</P><P>     Dayton Hyde's experience is all too common. Under the current Endangered Species Act, as well as other laws, landowners frequently improve or protect habitat, then face land-use restrictions imposed by government agencies (commonly the EPA or Fish and Wildlife Service). These restrictions often have perverse ecological and ethical consequences.</P><P>     First, they often impede efforts to protect threatened species and critical habitats. Second, they constitute uncompensated &quot;takings,&quot; a form of political plunder.</P><P>     The Endangered Species Act has failed to encourage species and habitat protection because it employs the wrong kind of incentives. Landowners with threatened species on their property may face restrictions that diminish the value of the property and reduce their income from ranching, farming and similar activities. The Act's negative incentives do not enlist the talents and resources of private landowners. Instead, they often discourage cooperation and innovation.</P><P>     The Fifth Amendment was designed to protect citizens from government takings. Its framers understood the harm caused by negative incentives. But today their wisdom is ignored. Landowners know that designated species are likely to impose significant financial costs and restrict their use of the land. Anticipating restrictions, they may accelerate the destruction of habitat.</P><P>     Norman Hutson Jr., of Fort Lewis, Wash., reluctantly clear-cut his tree farm in anticipation of restrictions to protect the spotted owl. Other landowners may covertly disobey regulations or eliminate species and habitat to preclude losses.</P><P>     In the United States, 50 percent of endangered species dwell almost exclusively on private lands. Given the Endangered Species Act's dismal record on private lands, a new approach is needed. With the Act facing renewal in 1994, there is a tremendous opportunity to erect positive incentives with the creation of Biodiversity Trust Funds.</P><P>     The trust funds would purchase conservation easements, much as the North American Elk Foundation, Trout Unlimited, and Ducks Unlimited have done. The trust funds would pay landowners to pursue conservation on their property and could copy Defenders of Wildlife's policy of paying landowners a bounty when an endangered species breeds on their land. Another possibility, noted by Vice President Jim Kraft of Plum Creek Timber and professor Bruce Lippke of the University of Washington, is to use long-term federal bonds to accelerate purchase and retirement of critical habitats.</P><P>     The forces that control land use are largely economic. With this in mind, trust funds have a significant advantage over the current reliance on legal penalties. By buying land and easements or paying bounties, trust funds create positive financial rewards for saving species and habitats. At the very least, landowners who already favor environmental improvements on their land (and many do) are no longer punished for their efforts. The Dayton Hyde dilemma is avoided.  Landowners who are good stewards are rewarded or compensated for creating wetlands, preserving old-growth trees, or encouraging wolves to breed on their lands.</P><P>     In the environmental area as elsewhere, rewards work much better than penalties. They foster innovation and entrepreneurship in environmental protection. With rewards, ranchers might reserve some lands from grazing to improve wildlife habitat, then charge recreationalists and hunters user fees. Commercial forest owners could lengthen rotation times of harvest and selectively log their older trees. Whatever specific approach is taken, owners would have financial incentives to nurture environmental health. Rewards also make compliance and progress easy to monitor because landowners advertise their environmental improvements.</P><P>     Penalties, like fines or imprisonment, are often less effective. They make monitoring difficult because they encourage landowners to covertly evade the law, accelerating logging or eliminating species before costly regulations are enacted or enforced. Penalties also encourage some landowners to abandon commercial or recreational projects, even if these projects could have been undertaken in environmentally sound ways. Private caution becomes society's loss.</P><P>     Incentives are a major factor in shaping individual behavior. Reform of the Endangered Species Act offers an important opportunity to encourage species and habitat protection, not discourage it. By linking personal gain with environmental health and by using cooperation rather than fines, imprisonment, and &quot;takings,&quot; a reformed Environmental Species Act can harmonize ecology, individual creativity and initiative, and prosperity.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>            I HAVE long held a vision of what a good society would include. Its most important elements are liberty, environmental quality and communities of people who value both. But only certain institutional arrangements foster these ends. History is unlikely to show that yesterday's election moved us toward these goals.</P><P>       But elections do cause thoughtful people to carefully separate their hopes from their expectations. We hope that people will weigh the public interest more heavily than their narrow self interest. However, elections usually teach us to expect concentrated interests to prevail and government to grow.</P><P>     Organized interests solidify their gains by creating institutions and agencies. With these in place, even modest reforms become difficult to enact. We see this in the protracted efforts to increase the price of grazing federal lands. For grazing on our family's Montana ranch we charge more than $10 per cow and calf per month. On federal land near ours, permit holders such as Metropolitan Life Insurance pay $1.85 for their Forest Service and BLM grass.</P><P>     This is a predictable consequence of political allocation. We would surely be far better off if the grazing rights recognized the value of wildlife habitat and were freely exchangeable on the open market. But today's political incentives work against such rational outcomes. This is just one example of a program that violates reasonable standards of economic efficiency, ecological sensitivity and social equity.</P><P>     America's founders understood that when governments control large sectors of an economy, governance becomes an exercise in relatively peaceful, although involuntary, wealth transfers. Stealth and duplicity are great assets in this game. It often takes great skill and dedication to discover these transfers.</P><P>     But the benefits of reform are widely diffused. No individual has an economic incentive to advocate reform as strongly as the beneficiaries do to preserve existing institutions. Large permit holders such as Metropolitan Life have more to gain from their subsidies than any single one of us will gain by fighting them. Today, only the congenital do-gooder has incentives to expose the waste and inequities of political mischief. I propose a modest reform: Let's create a Predatory Bureaucracy.</P><P>     The logic is simple and straightforward. It is part of the convergence developing between ecological and economic theory. Essentially, the predatory bureau would receive a small percentage of any budgetary proposal offered by an agency. Here's an outline of the process I initially envisioned.</P><P>     For most of us the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries a crust of derision. Rigidity, inflexibility, insensitivity and persistence are their defining characteristics. However good our intentions in creating an agency, its budgetary imperatives ultimately lead it to stray from these goals. Over the long haul, bureaucracies are usually run for the convenience of its leaders and the clientele on whom they depend for political support. For those of us wanting reform, our design problem is to link this persistent tendency with the public interest. The predatory bureaucracy does so.</P><P>     We can learn a lot from a relatively successful example. The U.S. Post Office is closely and consistently monitored and faces increasing competition from Federal Express, fax, etc. Despite our complaining, the Post Office actually does quite well because it faces the kind of feedback we expect in the market. What can we do about agencies that do not have these checks on their performance? Here is where our &quot;predatory bureau&quot; can help advance the public interest.</P><P>     A predatory bureaucracy survives only by preying upon other bureaucracies' budgets. Like coyotes to rabbits and wolves to elk, it will eliminate many vulnerable programs.</P><P>     The basic idea is simple enough to write into a state initiative. We should create an agency whose income will only come preying upon the specific program budgets of other agencies. Suppose an agency proposes a new program, or seeks to continue an obsolete one. Our predatory agency may challenge this proposal. It will use the press, interest groups and other political avenues.</P><P>     Unlike most of us, this agency has a vital interest in defeating a wasteful idea because (unlike most agencies) it only gets funding from its successes. If the other agency's proposal loses, it receives 1 percent of the defeated agency's budget proposal. And the defeated agency loses that 1 percent and gets a proportional amount taken from its operating budget.</P><P>     After an initial two-years' funding, this agency will cost taxpayers nothing. Its income comes only from other agencies. Because all agencies will begin to act more wisely, on pain of being attacked by our predator, enormous amounts of tax money will be saved due to weak programs not being proposed.</P><P>     Incorporating a predatory bureaucracy into government may do more than elections to control government waste. It's a way to harmonize the public interest with the self-interest of experts in the political process. Let's consider this idea while waiting for next November.</P><P>_________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>PEOPLE who believe in the power of government to do good probably found it outrageous that the U.S. Senate squandered weeks debating higher grazing fees, a financially trivial issue. The Western Senators' filibuster diverted the Senate from critically important issues like NAFTA and health care. But this posturing is a predictable consequence of political management of the Western range.</P><P>       Current policies encourage overgrazing, discourage range improvements, inhibit innovation and sharply restrict allowable uses on the 315 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service. But below-cost grazing fees are not the primary source of ecological problems. The sources are rigid bureaucracies and insecure property rights.</P><P>     When looking at grazing fee &quot;subsidies,&quot; most commentators ignore an important fact: Aside from unanticipated inflation, the value of the &quot;subsidy&quot; has largely been incorporated into the sales price of private ranches with grazing privileges on public range. The BLM and Forest Service permits are attached to a &quot;base unit&quot; property (i.e., a private ranch). The ranch's sales price captures the value of cheap public grazing that comes with it.</P><P>     It is as if a car came with a sticker entitling the owner to 20 cent a gallon gas. The car with the sticker would sell for more than one without because it includes a valuable subsidy. Similarly, subsidies increase the value of a ranch possessing federal grazing permits.</P><P>     Ranchers who received the original fee subsidy in 1934 died with a one-time windfall gain. But many present owners have already paid for the subsidy through higher prices when they bought ranches with public grazing permits. Most present owners can afford higher fees, but ethically, this is irrelevant.  While we should adjust fees for inflation, it seems unfair to impose a penalty on present owners just because the original owners received an unjust, unearned financial gain.</P><P>     Dr. Karl Hess Jr., a range ecologist, expert on Western lands and author of &quot;Visions Upon the Land,&quot; notes that higher fees are unlikely to improve ecological conditions and reduce overgrazing on the public range. If we want improvement, we need to change existing institutional arrangements, not simply fiddle with prices.</P><P>     Ecological and social problems are caused by regulations that encourage poor management practices - grazing too many cows and sheep, underinvesting in range improvements and maintenance and failing to replace domestic stock with more valuable wildlife. As noted above, poor management persists for two reasons: bureaucracy and imperfectly transferable property rights. Better management will follow secure, well-defined, and transferable property rights for those who use the public range, be they a private ranch or the Nature Conservancy Trust.</P><P>    I suggest a modest reform. Give those with privileges to graze on public land the opportunity to buy a grazing right at a price incorporating the future value of the &quot;subsidized&quot; fee. Economists call this price the capitalized value of the fee. Logically, it would be similar to converting an apartment to a condominium. Future rents of the apartment are capitalized into the sale price of the condominium.</P><P>     With this reform, ranchers would have legal property rights to the public forage. They could exchange those rights among themselves or sell them to those with other interests, e.g., ecological diversity, wildlife habitat for hunters, or stream-side preservation. These interests are growing and new ones will surely develop.</P><P>     Incorporating the subsidy into the permit's price avoids penalizing owners who &quot;purchased&quot; a subsidy when they bought their private land and should reduce their opposition to reform. Everyone is better off because current owners retain access to the public range and taxpayers no longer subsidize management. There are also new incentives for innovation.</P><P>     At present, the permit is only for grazing domestic livestock, even if the land has greater value for wildlife or recreation. BLM policy dictates that grazing privileges must be used. If not used, they are sold to others. Thus, when organizations acquire public range privileges and try to retire them from grazing, the privileges are stripped away. Last April, this happened to the Nature Conservancy in Mercer vs. BLM. If grazing rights were freely transferable, diverse uses would flourish, reflecting emerging environmental values.</P><P>     A legal property right to forage on public lands would also discourage overgrazing and encourage range improvements. Ranchers could rest overused lands without fear of regulatory reprisal. Moreover, if ranchers knew they would benefit from range improvements, they are more likely to replant native grasses and forbs that have been destroyed by a century of overgrazing. Cooperating with others, some would also manage for wildlife.</P><P>     Environmentalists and those seeking efficient government can join to promote institutional reforms that recognize new ecological understandings and changing tastes. When we allocate via politics, special interests and financial waste will prevail. Property rights and voluntary arrangements are far more responsive - and often more responsible. </P><P>------------------------------------------------------------------- </P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is easy to be an enthusiastic supporter of recycling, especially in Seattle. Recycling requires little effort from consumers and appears to eliminate waste and alleviate pressures on the environment. Recycling is an easy choice for those who believe it will always save money and resources. They have little problem equating it with conservation and making it a litmus test for green values.</P><P>       But recycling is not always a wise idea. Like many good things it entails tradeoffs, tradeoffs that make its environmental effects ambiguous and dependent on local circumstances. Recycling consumes valuable labor, capital, time and urban space. It imposes environmental and economic costs through transportation, sorting, processing and remanufacturing and sometimes these costs outweigh the gains of reusing a resource. Without knowledge of the tradeoffs, a knowledge usually communicated through prices, it is difficult to make responsible decisions.</P><P>      Lynn Scarlett of the Reason Foundation is someone who has studied the tradeoffs inherent to recycling. She analyzed seven of the best curbside recycling programs in the United States and found that the net cost was $110 per ton after subtracting an average salvage value of $35 per ton. These were the best cases. The average net cost for curbside recycling is about $150 to $200 per ton. Much of the gap between costs and value is a deadweight loss, a needless waste of resources.</P><P>      However, Scarlett's results should not be taken to indicate that all recycling is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Some early losses in recycling can be investments in experiments that may ultimately pay off. The problem is that it is difficult to determine whether recycling a specific object, such as plastic soft drink bottles (Polyethylene Terephthalate, or P.E.T.), makes environmental sense. Like so many things in life, it depends.</P><P>      One of the things on which it depends is our position on the recycling learning curve (i.e., how much we know about recycling an object). When producing any good, the first units are often quite expensive. For example, computing power used to be very expensive. The first computer, ENIAC, cost the U.S. government $3 million and delivered less computing power than a modern calculator. Today, the same computing power is available for roughly $30. This is the learning curve at its best - producing vastly better products at much lower prices. Though less dramatic, the same logic applies to recycling; the longer we recycle, the more efficient and effective we become.</P><P>      Now this rule only applies when recycling programs generate incentives to innovate and learn. Plans that do not, like Germany's &quot;green dot&quot; program, are extremely wasteful. The German system mandates that firms must recycle a certain percentage of their products. Like many government plans, it makes recycling a burden rather than an opportunity and thereby discourages innovation. We can expect far better results from recycling efforts designed by producers and supported by consumers.</P><P>      There are some attractive recycled products coming onto the market as firms ascend the learning curve. Patagonia, for example, has recently introduced a new Synchilla fleece. This fabric is 80 percent recycled fiber made from (P.E.T.) soda-pop bottles and 20 percent virgin polyester. It is slightly more expensive than the fabric it replaced and is not quite as soft. Nevertheless, people love the fleece and the idea behind it. Wholesalers have already sold out their fall stocks.</P><P>      BMW presents another example with the planned introduction of the first 100 percent recyclable car and auto-recycling facility. Both firms are using profits from sales of existing products to subsidize the development of recyclable products. In doing so they are pushing the market up the recycling learning curve.</P><P>      Efforts to recycle among firms producing luxury or high-end products offer an interesting dilemma. Although &quot;Beamers&quot; are often derided as yuppie toys and Patagonia satirized as &quot;Patagucci,&quot; the customers and stockholders of these firms are subsidizing movement up the learning curve. Their efforts to commercialize recycling provide a significant public good.</P><P>      As the technology pioneered by &quot;luxury&quot; firms advances and less-workable ideas are filtered out, the cost of producing recycled products decrease. (Today, P.E.T. is actually less expensive than virgin material for carpet fiber). This encourages wider use of recycled material. Firms serving larger markets, like WalMart and Costco, will ultimately feature recycled products as the most successful processes are refined.</P><P>      Recycling can be environmentally harmful and economically wasteful. Unfortunately, these problems are most likely when politics intervenes and obscures the existence of tradeoffs. Politics can push recycling too hard by mandating trendy but harmful and inefficient programs, like recycled content mandates. These approaches stifle innovation and creativity. Although the market is by no means perfect, when prices approximate full costs, it provides the best path toward socially and environmentally responsible products.</P><P>________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>            AT a conference last October, I listened to a speech by Gregory Benford, a respected biophysicist and acclaimed writer of science fiction. He noted that the 19th century had been dominated scientifically and culturally by chemistry, the 20th by physics, and predicted the 21st would be dominated by biology.</P><P>       Professor Benford is undoubtedly correct that the coming &quot;Biological Century&quot; promises staggering benefits, benefits likely to rival those wrought by chemistry and physics. But there will also be resistance. Before we can judge how to react to biological developments and their opponents, it may be helpful to consider some relevant facts.</P><P>      One important point is that biotechnology has already produced many useful innovations. For example, bioengineered human insulin has reduced the discomfort and inconveniences of diabetes. Drought- and disease-resistant crops have dramatically improved yields worldwide and reduced the need for fertilizers, pesticides and cropland. Perhaps most impressive of all, the ambitious Human Genome Project is already increasing our knowledge of genetics and revealing the causes of many inheritable diseases.</P><P>      Consider one potentially beneficial innovation: synthetic bovine somatotropin (BST), a replica of the hormone that stimulates lactation in cows. Synthetic BST supplements cows' natural hormones, increasing milk production by an average of 9 pounds per cow per day. It is environmentally beneficial because it increases the amount of milk that can be produced from a given amount of grains and grasses. But such wonders are costly. Monsanto, a leading pharmaceutical company, spent an estimated $300 to $500 million developing BST during the 1980s.</P><P>      BST has undergone extensive safety testing. In 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that its use poses no danger to humans or cows. The FDA found that milk from cows treated with BST is virtually indistinguishable from other cows' milk. It has the same proteins, nutrients and concentrations of BST as milk from untreated cows. The National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and World Health Organization have also found BST to be completely safe for humans.</P><P>      In spite of the financial and research investments made to ensure BST's effectiveness and safety, certain groups have strongly opposed its introduction. The opposition has three sources: genuine fears that modified organisms may be harmful to humans or the environment; political entrepreneurs who seek to benefit by creating a crisis atmosphere, and special interests whose political privileges are threatened by its introduction.</P><P>      Such opportunistic opposition to innovation has great risks. It can increase the already significant costs of developing products like BST, slowing their rate of introduction and denying people their benefits.</P><P>      Apprehension regarding BST is understandable and I, too, urge caution. But after years of study and research, little, if any, danger is likely. Bioengineered organisms have caused no harm to people or the environment even after dozens of field tests and the escape of millions of microbes from laboratories. The National Academy of Sciences, Ecological Society of America and most DNA biologists agree that biotechnology poses minimal risks if properly monitored. BST is no exception.</P><P>      The opposition voiced by political entrepreneurs and special interests is less principled. As demonstrated by the Alar scare (not a biotech product), these groups are quite willing to purposely mislead the public through incorrect science and media hype.</P><P>      Jeremy Rifkin is perhaps the most prominent political entrepreneur in the realm of biotechnology. Rifkin has made a career from fear-mongering - authoring numerous anti-technological books and running his &quot;nonprofit&quot; Foundation for Economic Trends. Ignoring scientific evidence and preying on the public's lack of information, he has implied that BST and other biotech products are unhealthy or unnatural. By creating public opposition, he increases the pressure on legislators and regulators to institute policies that slow biotechnological innovation.</P><P>      The conflict over BST is a harbinger of things to come. If selfishly motivated individuals are allowed to manipulate public opinion and the regulatory process without being accountable for the accuracy of their facts, we will seriously curtail the development of biotechnology. This would be an enormous tragedy because the benefits it promises are immense and within reach.</P><P>      The century of biology is neither guaranteed nor automatic. If it is to blossom we must ensure that regulatory decisions follow sound science and the interests of the citizenry, not the machinations of special interests. The alternative will leave all of us poorer. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

BADEN</P><P> I'M BACK HOME in Montana for the Christmas break. It's zero degrees at daybreak, no wind, clear day. It's great to be on the ranch, but there is something I miss. This morning brought it back.</P><P>       In this holiday season when we show understanding toward others, it helps to know people who spend their lives living in the rural spaces of the country. Most of us who spend our time in cities cannot know about the rural way of life or understand those who identify with the Wise Use movement. Coming back to Montana always helps me understand why people want to protect the life they have here.</P><P>       This morning was like a morning 23 years ago: Daylight breaking, just below zero, no wind, off to work, a great day in the making. I'd like to share the best part.</P><P>       Up Taylor Fork of the West Gallatin River, about 15 miles from Yellowstone Park, I heard a beautiful and moving sound. This morning it came back in my mind. It's still beautiful, and it still moves me.</P><P>       It's quiet at dawn, at zero degrees, at 7,000 feet - no background noise. Any sound captures attention. And I hear this deep, rhythmic, resonant, powerful call. It told me, &quot;Let's go. It's cold out, but we aren't very cold yet and soon we'll both be warm.&quot; If the sun stays out and the wind stays down I'll shed my jacket by noon and work in long johns and a shirt until lunch. I'll enjoy the food and the rest. I'll need the recharge.</P><P>       I wish I could write sounds, for my story is better if you hear this. This sound is compelling, and its message is passing. This and other sounds of the West remind people of better times.</P><P>       The sound starts deep, regular and rhythmic. It's loud but muffled. We can't see its source, yet we know what it is - but today it's a bit different. What's happened?</P><P>        A faller's saw wouldn't start, and he's standing on the tracks of a D 7 Cat with his chain saw over the exhaust. They're warming up together. His saw will start; the Cat's wake-up purr will shift to a good working growl, changing with load and slope.</P><P>       We were good at doing solid work, making logs from trees and getting them to a mill where they were converted to products people wanted. Although few on the crew thought of it this way, we were part of the international economy. Our work in the woods was economic coordination spontaneously at work. Here are the details we experienced and enjoyed.</P><P>       Cutters put standing trees on the ground without hanging the falling trees on others. They stuck the nail of the tape on the butt of what would become the first log. They walked the tree, limbing it on the way, then bucked it to log length, two or three logs per tree. Skidders jumped off their Cats, set chokers on two to six logs, swung back into the Cat and hit the winch.</P><P>       The mainline of the rigging tightened, and the chokers came taut. Maneuvering the Cat to avoid hang-ups on stumps, the skidder headed for the landing. He'd unhook the chokers and deck the logs, then spin the Cat and go for another turn. Football linebackers and collegiate wrestlers are well-suited to this work.</P><P>       It was great! I miss it still. And I didn't need a workout before going to work.</P><P>       We worked together and with nature. The faller and Cat skinner warming engines together, falling and bucking were with an eye toward choker setting and skidding; otherwise the snow would soon hide the logs. The work, the action, the coordination, the clear and unambiguous value of what we produced, I liked it a lot. Occasionally, when looking for something else in the ranch's shop, I find artifacts of those years.</P><P>       The story of that morning 23 years ago illustrates parts of the Wise Use philosophy so many critics ignore: strength, skill, trust, teamwork producing real products with obvious value. Neglecting these values in the interest of promoting a &quot;new West,&quot; all green and sensitive but absent grease and guts, isn't fully honest.</P><P>       As lattes replace logging boots, arrogance often overrides empathy. There are good people out there who identify with Wise Use. They have different and competing visions for the West's future. I thought of them this holiday season.</P><P>       I respect the best of these people just as I respect the best of my academic colleagues. I can't forget them even though I work more with symbols than with metal and drink wine rather than whiskey. The world they envision is no more. Like the open range, it can't be preserved in its old form. I'd like to help smooth the transition to a sustainable economy that respects liberty and recognizes the culture of our recent past.</P><P>       This is the holiday season that stresses good will to all. I hope we will have enough good will to realize that there are values of the old that would benefit the new Northwest. Perhaps we can build new communities with shared values of liberty and environmental quality. This is my goal for the new year. You are welcome to join me. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

And many environmentalists are gloating.</P><P>      They are using the grizzly, the wolf and the salmon - symbolically some of America's most important creatures - together with one of the most obscure, the northern spotted owl, to hold development hostage.</P><P>      But if pushed to its ultimate extreme, the Endangered Species Act could so disrupt economies that pressure to amend it - or challenge it on constitutional grounds - will become irresistible.</P><P>      Environmentalists do a good job of explaining the prime rule of ecology: Everything is tied to everything else. We can never do just one thing; everything in an ecosystem is linked. This is why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat, such as the spotted owl, are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>      However, we are also learning that such interdependence applies equally to political and economic systems: There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences.</P><P>      Those of us who value the endangered wolf, grizzly or owl's habitat should ask the same question for any actions taken under the Endangered Species Act - especially when that law begins to affect private-property rights.</P><P>      The political process inevitably links economics and ecology. People's ecological concern is directly related to their security and prosperity. Since economic as well as ecological systems are highly dynamic, proposed changes are likely to bring unintended mischief. We are seeing this unfold with the spotted owl.</P><P>      The reaction from the timber industry and many Northwest politicians to preserving a habitat of 11.3 million acres was vitriolic. At a rally in May, Washington Gov. Booth Gardner told 3,000 loggers and their families: &quot;The latest designation of habitat is unnecessary, unacceptable and inconsistent with the law, and we can't allow it.&quot;</P><P>      On the same day, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer barred the U.S. Forest Service from selling any more timber in northern-spotted-owl habitat until it finished writing rules to ensure the bird's survival.</P><P>      If there is any certainty in the spotted-owl saga, it is that the government will not voluntarily compensate private landowners for their losses in helping to save the owl. Like the spotted owl, property rights are threatened, if not endangered.</P><P>      The critical habitat plan for preserving the spotted owl has many unintended consequences. Some of these, like the loss of timber-related jobs, are obvious. Others are less apparent. Among these hidden consequences is the impact on management incentives of property owners.</P><P>      There is no doubt that the Endangered Species Act applies to private lands. Under Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, private landowners are prohibited from &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;harming&quot; listed species. There is nothing in the act that speaks to the taking or harming of private-property rights, but there is such a provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</P><P>      The spotted-owl controversy is the tip of the iceberg of conflict between endangered-species protection and private-property rights. The Fish and Wildlife Service also is on the verge of listing the Columbia River sockeye salmon as endangered.</P><P>      The sockeye is only the first of many anadromous fish runs being studied by the agency. The potential impact for private rights in land and water could make the spotted-owl regulations seem insignificant.</P><P>      The Endangered Species Act specifically states that economic factors are not to play a role in the decision to list a species as threatened or endangered.</P><P>       Many biologists even questioned the appropriateness of placing two economists on the recovery task force for the spotted owl. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit if they do not.</P><P>      A far better solution would be to use economic incentives to help protect endangered species. One approach would create a Biodiversity Trust Fund, derived from a fixed percentage of the revenues from public land activities - such as logging, mining, grazing and recreation - that impinge on wildlife habitat.</P><P>      If these resources were sold at fair market value, and 10 percent were paid to the fund, between $500 million and $1 billion per year would be available to protect critical wildlife habitat.</P><P>      A Biodiversity Fund board of trustees, consisting of respected scientists with specialties in fields such as evolutionary biology and restoration ecology, could be nominated by the National Academy of Sciences to allocate this money.</P><P>       They could buy conservation easements in the areas where disturbances might harm listed species. They also could pay &quot;bounties&quot; to land managers if an endangered species successfully breeds on their land.</P><P>      The trust fund would completely change the incentives surrounding rare and endangered species. Private landowners would support, rather than oppose, the listing of new species because of the potential that they could get paid for harboring such species.              In the end, protection would be possible for a wider number of species without all the political and legal turmoil that now surrounds the Endangered Species Act.</P><P>      And the Endangered Species Act might no longer be endangered.</P><P>________________</P><P> John Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), with offices in Bozeman, Mont., and Seattle. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

BADEN</P><P>           THE Montana chapter of Defenders of Wildlife has announced a new program to encourage wolf re-introduction. This is noteworthy because it seeks to do so with the help of ranchers, until now some of the wolves' staunchest  opponents. This approach could hold the key to fostering the recovery of  endangered species nationwide and have implications for the Northwest's debate  over the spotted owl.</P><P>  While the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires species preservation, it does little to address the means of such preservation. The Defenders of Wildlife  program pledges to pay $5000 to any landowner in the Northern Rockies who has wild wolves successfully reproduce on their private land.</P><P>     &quot;Our fondest dream is to give away a lot of money,&quot; says Hank Fischer of Defenders of Wildlife. The wolf program will supplement the ESA and its  mandates, utilizing the power of economic incentives, which until now have  worked against the wolf.</P><P>     There are many reasons why the carrot of economic incentives may be more  effective than the stick of the ESA. It turns opponents of preserving specific  species into proponents by offering to pay for their assistance. Hundreds of  individuals will now seek ways to directly improve wolf habitat instead of being indifferent at best, hostile and destructive at worst. Individuals who are being paid to harbor wolves are unlikely to sue over land-use restrictions. And it is a first step toward recognizing the real economic importance of endangered species.</P><P>     While conservationists argue that species are &quot;priceless,&quot; that does not change the reality and incentives facing those who are most directly affected by recovery efforts. The decision to foster species recovery is ecological, but the impacts are economic and political. Those impacts must be addressed before successful recovery can take place.</P><P>     The prime rule of ecology - that everything in an ecosystem is linked - explains why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat (such as the spotted owl) are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>     Such interdependence is also found in political and economic systems. There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences as the spontaneous order adjusts. Mandates that seem simple from Washington, D.C., have unexpected consequences when implemented in the West.</P><P>     Under the current system, no federal agency has an incentive to consider  economic efficiency. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for  public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit, the stick, if they do not. The Defenders of Wildlife have tried to change that by offering the carrot.</P><P>     Since 1987, the Defenders of Wildlife have run a program that compensated ranchers for cattle killed by wolves. It has paid over $12,000 to 10 Montana ranchers who have lost cattle. However, this program, while reducing the risk to ranchers, gave them little incentive to actually facilitate wolf re-introduction. Indeed, many still believe that the associated hassle is not worth the benefits of wolf re-introduction.</P><P>     Ranchers risk losing control of their property when a wolf pack chooses their land as its territory. The long arm of the federal Endangered Species Act could force them to alter long-established land-use practices if they threatened the viability of a resurgent wolf population. An endangered species takes precedence over private property rights. Not only could ranchers lose control over their property, but they risked their cattle as well. Even if they would be compensated for predator loss, was it worth the hassle?</P><P>       This is the central problem of the Endangered Species Act: It imposes the costs of species survival not widely upon those who like the animals, but narrowly upon those who own the habitat. This is the preservationists version of the NIMBY problem: Many people like wolves, but Not In My Barn Yard. Just as few people wish to live next to a waste incinerator, few ranchers with horses and other livestock want the worries of wolf predation.</P><P>     This is where the Defenders of Wildlife has entered. By pledging to pay ranchers who have wolf dens on their lands, they have changed the entire incentive structure. Now if a rancher has habitat that attracts a pack of wolves, he has incentives to encourage their success. Instead of seeking to hide the wolves presence - &quot;shoot, shovel and shut-up&quot; - he would inform scientists and wildlife officials so that he might be compensated. Instead of discouraging continued habitation through various, possibly illegal, means, he might choose to improve habitat to ensure future payments. More could be spent studying growing populations and less spent turning ecologists into law-enforcement officers.</P><P>     No longer will those who have the most reason to oppose wolves be charged  with their upkeep. The costs would be spread among those who most strongly  desire healthy wolf populations. It is likely that this will result in more rapid population expansion, to the benefit of both those who love wolves and those who harbor them.</P><P>     The issue of wolves in Montana can teach us much about our own debates over the spotted owl. The Defenders of Wildlife have shown us how the right incentives can change landowners from victims to supporters of endangered species.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/wolf.gif" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=263><P>__________________</P><P> John A.

NAFTA would create the world's largest free-trade zone, encompassing over 360 million people and $6.2 trillion worth of goods and services a year.</P><P>     The potential benefits are substantial. One recent economic analysis by the Institute for International Economics calculated that NAFTA's adoption would result in a net increase of about 175,000 jobs in the U.S. by 1995. The pact would also benefit Mexico</P><P> by further opening the wealthy U.S. market to their goods, creating jobs and prosperity. And Mexico would benefit as a trade agreement creates new opportunities for direct foreign investment and energizes its rapidly modernizing economy.</P><P>     However, all is not rosy for the future of NAFTA. While both President Bush and Governor Clinton claim to support free trade, both are subject to election-year pressures. This has produced protectionist benefits for brewers, state-owned industries, auto producers, and bankers, among others. Environmentalists and traditional protectionists, &quot;Baptists and Bootleggers&quot; as their unholy alliance is called, have formed a powerful voice against NAFTA and gained a hearing with both Congress and trade negotiators.</P><P>     Earlier this month the House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 in favor of a nonbinding resolution that calls for the trade accord to not jeopardize American health, safety, and environmental standards. Worries abound that Mexico will become a &quot;pollution haven,&quot; spawning a multitude of dirty industries and encouraging U.S. companies to migrate to Mexico to avoid tough domestic environmental laws. However, the best available information suggests that NAFTA will foster both environmental safeguards and progress.</P><P>     The Bush administration states that any trade agreement must &quot;maintain the right to prohibit the entry of goods that do not meet U.S. health, safety, pesticide, food and drug and environmental regulations.&quot; The qualifications are (1) such regulations must apply equally to domestic and foreign producers (and therefore not constitute an unfair barrier to trade), and (2) they must have a scientific basis. A trilateral commission composed of trade experts, scientists, and environmentalists is being formed to hear challenges to the environmental rules of trading partners.</P><P>     Much concern about the creation of &quot;pollution havens&quot; centers on Mexico and its lax enforcement of environmental laws. However, the World Bank finds little evidence that companies are willing to move manufacturing plants simply to avoid environmental regulations, as environmental costs form a small percentage of total costs. And it is likely that the increased foreign investment brought by free trade will bring with it advanced pollution control technologies. U.S. multinationals often hold foreign plants and subsidiaries to U.S. environmental standards.</P><P>     Historically, Mexico's environment has been far dirtier than accepted U.S. standards. But that is changing because environmental knowledge, sensitivity, and managerial ability all increase with rising per capita income. These good things go together.</P><P>     For Mexican President Salinas, environmental protection holds a high priority. He has privatized many inefficient and polluting state-owned industries, requiring them to meet tougher environmental standards to which they were not subject as state-owned companies. He has increased his environmental agency's budget from $4.3 million to $88.4 million in five years. Mexico has started to work with the U.S. EPA to clean up the highly polluted maquiladoras assembly plants and the rapidly growing &quot;sister cities&quot; of the border region. The two countries are planning to spend about $1 billion here over the next three years.</P><P>     These steps will go a significant way toward protecting human health and the environment in Mexico. And it is important to note that the best way for the U.S. to ensure that Mexico continues this environmental progress is to support NAFTA.</P><P>     This is because a free-trade agreement brings increased national prosperity - and it is prosperity that fuels demand for higher standards of environmental quality. Rich nations have cleaner environments than do poor nations. Recent research by Professor Donald Coursey of Washington University in St. Louis shows that across time and across countries per capita spending on the environment rises directly with income. Protected land acreage also rises with income, implying that more forest preserves and parks will be created as Mexico grows richer.</P><P>     Delegates at June's Earth Summit in Rio noted that poverty is the chief threat to both the environment and human health. EPA Administrator William Reilly writes about NAFTA that &quot;As the Mexican economy grows, so will its devotion to environmental protection and its ability to pay the costs of environmental stewardship.&quot; The lesson is that environmental quality and economic prosperity are strongly and positively linked. As a free country grows and rises out of subsistence living it becomes more, not less, environmentally friendly.</P><P>     By increasing incomes and promoting economic growth in Mexico through a North American Free-Trade Agreement, the U.S. can increase Mexico's environmental awareness and ability to effectively steward its environmental resources. That is a relationship that should appeal to both environmentalists and free-traders alike.</P><P>______________</P><P> John Baden is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the Environmental Management Program in the School of Business at the University of Washington.

BADEN</P><P>           JAMES Watt, Ronald Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, was an environmental paradox. To environmentalists, he personified an obsolete view of nature, a view seeing only commercial value in natural resources. But for the Greens, Watt was a useful icon of rapacious industrial exploitation. As such, he deserves much of the credit for the rise of professional environmentalism. He was the enemy that united their followers. He fueled massive fund-raising campaigns to thwart the Reagan Administration's policy directives.</P><P>       As an unapologetic voice for industry, Vice President Dan Quayle is a pale incarnation of James Watt. Quayle, who runs the White House Council on Competitiveness, is the focal point of environmental groups for his deregulatory fervor and pro-business attitude; he supported efforts to allow logging in the Northwest's old-growth forests while dismissing concerns about the spotted owl. His message: the environment costs jobs.</P><P>       The Council's goal is to boost the economy by reducing the burdens of environmental regulations. For example, they proposed reclassifying hazardous waste, allowing the least toxic types to be buried at low cost in municipal landfills. But, independent of the merits of this proposal, it was withdrawn because of election-year environmental sensitivities.</P><P>       Environmental groups strongly favor Democratic vice presidential candidate  Al Gore over Quayle.</P><P>     Sen. Gore has been an environmental advocate for many years and has recently published &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; a personal treatise describing his eco-philosophy and prescriptions for change. He advertises his compassion and commitment to environmental issues and speaks constantly of &quot;the dangerous dilemma that our civilization now faces,&quot; and how he has renewed his commitment to ecology.</P><P>     And Gore's prescriptions are radical. One example from his book is &quot;the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.&quot; This is a worrisome proposal because Gore considers only the benefits of this idea and not the concurrent costs. He fails to ask the question that good ecologists must ask when confronting a proposed change, &quot;And then what?&quot; What are the likely direct and indirect consequences of his proposals, such as an increased number of power plants to power the presumed electric cars?</P><P>        When considering the greenhouse effect, Gore asserts that skeptics' theories &quot;should not be given equal weight,&quot; because such consideration, &quot;undermines the effort to build a solid base of public support for the difficult actions we must soon take.&quot; He ignores a recent Greenpeace poll showing that nearly half of the atmospheric scientists polled agreed that we have experienced no warming due to the Greenhouse effect, and that another quarter or so don't feel sufficiently informed to take a position.</P><P>     Most disturbingly, Gore wants an elite to make decisions for a public he seems not to trust. His conscious rejection of open scientific debate and blind advocacy for governmental policies that will drastically affect every American are the marks of zealotry, not understanding.</P><P>     People who &quot;know&quot; the truth often seek coercive government action to enforce their visions. As America's founders so well understood, this approach is seldom the answer to our problems. Gore's unswerving, and uncritical, environmental ideology deserves the same skepticism as Dan Quayle's single-minded and shortsighted protection of business interests.</P><P>       Gore is right, however, when he sees a false dichotomy between jobs and the environment. We can have a clean environment and economic progress. In the long run they are mutually dependent. That is something which Vice President Quayle does not seem to acknowledge.</P><P>     But creating institutions that foster these real benefits is not easy. Converting rhetoric into reality is tough.</P><P>     Both Gore and Quayle could learn that the solutions to environmental problems lie with the cooperation of responsible decision-makers. Solutions must involve knowledge of actions affecting the environment, identification of those decision-makers who influence such actions, and creation of incentives for those decision-makers to act responsibly. The key step is the creation of new legal and economic arrangements that employ property rights and market incentives to achieve environmental ends. This is the environmental leadership America needs.</P><P>     Several environmental groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, understand and apply this logic. Neither vice presidential contender, talking in absolutes about the apocalypse, whether it be environmental or economic, has yet articulated this understanding. Each promotes his own brand of environmental demagoguery.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE election of Governor Clinton and Senator Gore alerts us to a new environmental movement. They claim to be seeking innovative and efficient ways to achieve environmental goals. For the past 20 years such an alternative approach has been developed. It may at last receive the attention in Washington that it has earned in universities and think tanks.</P><P>       It is called the New Resource Economics (the NRE). It is based upon incentives and voluntary action. It recognizes the role property rights and markets play in coordinating and rationing valuable resources.</P><P>     But other than professional analysts and economists, few people understand the logic or applications. Much of the writing has been scholarly and highly specialized, read only by graduate students under duress. Through this and future columns, I will attempt to bridge this gap between academia and the concerned citizen.</P><P>     Most people in the Northwest are familiar with the battles over timber, spotted owls, and salmon. Traditional lawmaking and regulatory schemes have yet to find productive, mutually acceptable solutions. But there is another way, a win-win approach. It can lead to more environmentally sensitive management. The focus is upon how information and incentives affect decision-makers. There is explicit recognition that differing institutional arrangements generate different incentives and therefore different management decisions.</P><P>     Our natural resources are managed by a variety of legal and economic institutions, including markets, private companies, nonprofit corporations and government. Each has different but predictable benefits and flaws. Markets can only work when we can establish clear and transferable property rights and do so at a low cost. Nonprofits have problems motivating and monitoring their staffs and volunteers. Governmental agencies suffer from bureaucratic inefficiency and often turn into captives of special interests and engines of plunder. When advocating environmental reforms we should recognize that no institutional form is perfect, and consider the information and incentives of each in terms of the goals.</P><P>     This care is required because good intentions are not enough. The forces of self-interest are relentless. Over the long run, if environmental reform is to be successful, our institutions must direct this individual self-interest to environmental quality.</P><P>     Last summer's revelations about political pressures on U.S. Forest Service and Park Service regional leaders are compelling testimonies to the importance of this focus. When our resource and environmental agencies are dependent upon politics, their leaders face incentives to yield to political pressures. When existing incentives remain constant, merely changing agency personnel to those more &quot;committed&quot; will not solve the problem. Only changing the institutions will produce lasting changes.</P><P>     Many of our existing institutions work against environmental stewardship. When decision-makers are insulated from the costs of their actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems follow.</P><P> For example, when individuals are not rewarded for preserving habitat, it is under-produced. When pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced.</P><P>     Take the case of the Forest Service. Because it gets money from logging, not recreation, it is no surprise that it zealously promotes logging and road-building. A way to make the Forest Service more responsive to the public is to collect user fees from hikers, bikers, and campers. In a majority of National Forests, recreation could easily generate more net dollars than timber. And in areas where logging continues to be profitable, forest managers would face incentives to reduce its visual and environmental impact to retain their recreation income. In such ways, institutions can be arranged to make economic progress and environmental quality complementary.</P><P>       Private property and markets can be used to foster these mutually beneficial agreements and accommodations. For example, limited oil drilling allowed on the Rainey Preserve, an Audubon-owned migratory bird sanctuary in Louisiana, is an example of this. Oil companies compete to drill and produce in environmentally sensitive ways and Audubon gets royalties with which they expand sanctuaries. In a few more years the wells will be played out but the sanctuary will remain.</P><P>     Contrast this with oil exploration on government lands. Audubon raises money to fight such development. The NRE enables us to see why: By seeking to protect bird habitat on federal lands, Audubon signals environmental concern and generates income. However, it pays none of the opportunity costs of not exploiting that land.</P><P>     Good institutional arrangements, like Audubon's ownership of Rainey, make decision-makers responsible for both costs and benefits of an action, lessen political confrontation, and foster cooperation. Markets and property rights help weigh trade-offs. Because of political pressures, this is exceedingly difficult in government institutions.</P><P>     No institution is perfect, and a mix is required. But private property rights, incentives, voluntary action and entrepreneurial creativity are under-appreciated tools for the environmentalist. They foster the economic progress that encourages environmental concern and the capacity to act upon that concern. These are the features of this new approach that make it attractive to environmental economists and policy analysts. The question is whether the Clinton/Gore administration will demonstrate the political skills required to deliver the outcomes they claim to seek.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           AS PRESIDENT-ELECT Clinton and Vice President-elect Gore look toward Jan. 20, they must confront the problem of reconciling their environmental rhetoric with economic reality. Much is promised: Al Gore's environmental commitment is unprecedented for a vice president and adds to pent-up pressures to address environmental concerns.</P><P>       But this pressure comes during a flat economy and, thanks to Ross Perot, a heightened concern for our ballooning federal debt. These problems will seriously constrain the available options. As forest economist Randal O'Toole said, &quot;the federal deficit has become the nation's No. 1 environmental threat.&quot;</P><P>        We see a resolution in Senator Gore's book &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; He links fiscal prudence with environmental concern when he proposes that &quot;the first and most obvious changes involve the elimination of those public expenditures . . . that encourage and subsidize environmentally destructive economic activity.&quot; His position merits the support of both the National Taxpayers Union and Greenpeace. This opportunity was missed by the self-professed &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; administrations of the past 12 years.</P><P>     But if the new administration is to successfully advance such reforms, it must have a strong and consistent messenger to forcefully articulate this vision.</P><P>     Fortunately, one exists. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is an unused treasure. Created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), it was to be the ecological equivalent of the Council of Economic Advisers, &quot;to make and furnish . . . recommendations with respect to matters of (environmental) policy.&quot; But it never exercised a strong voice, and under the Reagan administration its funding was drastically cut. Rather than employing the CEQ as an instrument to advance reforms, the Reagan and Bush administrations simply shunted off, defunded and ignored it.</P><P>     The CEQ is required by law to publish an annual environmental-quality report. This volume can be used to show innovative ways to address environmental problems. Many such opportunities exist.</P><P>     For example, west of the 100th meridian, the federal government owns 50 percent of the land. These lands and waters are prime candidates for such reform. The growing field of environmental history documents the century plus of abuse which has plagued these lands as they were exploited by one constituency after another. The policies of government agencies were consistently rigged to benefit special interests. Heralded reforms only changed the channels of political control; they did not pull the plug.</P><P>     Today the West suffers from the bureaucratic residual of the well-intentioned Progressive Era reforms of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Under the Progressive Era's model, modern science and technology were to advance the public interest. Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service (1896) and the Bureau of Reclamation (1902) were created to provide omniscient, benevolent and far-sighted management.</P><P>     But they didn't. In reality, these agencies led to a century of government mismanagement and special-interest plums. Here, as in Eastern Europe, socialized management has failed to meet high environmental or economic standards while eroding ethics of those who work in or deal with the agencies.</P><P>     This is shown in virtually every government land-management agency: In the Northern and Central Rockies, Forest Regions 1 and 2, every forest lost money in fiscal year 1991, while the Forest Service promoted, through creative accounting and outright subsidies, clear-cutting on lands that would not be logged without government help.</P><P>       The Bureau of Land Management short-changes wildlife and encourages overgrazing while charging far below market rates for livestock. The Mining Law of 1872 allows firms to acquire minerals with no royalties, and then claim the land for nominal sums. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers subsidize the damming of free-flowing rivers to the benefit of a few politically powerful irrigation interests.</P><P>     Politics distorts National Park Service management of sensitive ecosystems and leads to massive disturbances of supposedly protected areas. These are the predictable consequences of political management.</P><P>     All of these abuses are ecologically and economically wasteful. They continue, of course, because the interests who benefit from these arrangements fight to maintain their favored status. They see their way of life threatened by reforms.</P><P>     They are not paranoid. It is threatened, and should be. Most of these government programs are disguised welfare. But in the mountains and on the plains as elsewhere, welfare generates dependency, not wealth. A program's existence should not guarantee its continuance.</P><P>     Perception of our fiscal crisis can drive these overdue reforms. By making users of federal lands, including recreation users, pay their own way, we can address both budgetary and ecological concerns. Hard-nosed analysis must be applied to other government programs as well. For example, government-subsidized coastal flood insurance, in addition to being a subsidy for wealthy home builders and buyers, increases seaside development in ecologically sensitive areas.</P><P>     In this world of scarcity we should always combine environmental concern with economic awareness. The Council on Environmental Quality can articulate these visions. Just as the Council of Economic Advisers has at times provided a strong voice for innovative economic policy prescriptions, the CEQ can provide a strong platform for environmental reform. If the environmental promises of our new administration are to be honored, they must harmonize the environment with economic forces. The CEQ can explain and advertise the appropriate reforms.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           KILLING WOLVES is a dramatic and highly controversial wildlife management practice. Alaska has recently proposed this as a way to boost caribou, moose, and deer populations for tourists and hunters.</P><P> But many people find gunning wolves from airplanes offensive and are outraged.</P><P>     The logic underlying the killing seems clear, but the issues are complex. Wolves do kill caribou, elk and moose - especially their young. Reducing wolf populations should increase the numbers of these ungulates, but by how much? There are bitter disputes among scientists over the size of predator impact upon prey populations.</P><P>     According to Dr. Fred Wagner, Director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, wildlife managers see three options:</P><P>       --  First, with no controls, predators and prey will reach a long-run equilibrium with low numbers of both.</P><P>     --  A second option - elimination of predators - allows herds to rise dramatically in the short term, but in the long run small populations result from degraded habitat.</P><P>     --  The third way is to moderately decrease predator numbers, providing a sustainable rise in ungulate populations. Alaska seems to follow this third, moderate control option, thereby enhancing big-game hunting.</P><P>     But the link between predator and prey is questioned by some scientists. They contend that herbivore numbers are primarily determined by habitat, that predators play only a marginal role in determining numbers of caribou, moose and elk. Only renewed habitat, such as that created by fire, can significantly increase populations. And regardless, they say, accurately determining the &quot;optimal&quot; wolf populations is hard to achieve.</P><P>     What precedents do we have for wolf-control programs?</P><P>       Yellowstone Park is a prime, if discouraging example. Wolves were deliberately eliminated from the Yellowstone ecosystem decades ago. Like most well-intentioned interventions in ecological and economic systems, the results have been different and more severe than anticipated.</P><P>     Elk populations in the Park have erupted, causing massive over-grazing and the prospect of mass starvation during severe Rocky Mountain winters. Whole plant and animal species have been decimated, drastically changing the park's ecology. What will be the results in the delicate Arctic tundra?</P><P>       Wolf controls have been tried in Alaska but without great success; bears, not wolves, were found to be taking the largest share of ungulates. So wolf numbers may, or may not, significantly impact prey numbers in Alaska.</P><P>     And as Dr. Kenneth Raedeke, a wildlife specialist at the University of Washington observes, &quot;having a brown bear control program, even in Alaska, is not (politically) acceptable.&quot; This gets to the heart of the matter: the nature of political decision-making. The decision to control wolf populations was made on the basis of political power, not science, economic efficiency or environmental sensitivity. Wolves, apparently, are thought to be politically acceptable targets while bears are not.</P><P>     In Alaska, Gov. Walter Hickel and special-interest groups such as the Alaska Outdoor Council, a coalition of outfitters, hunters</P><P> and bush pilots, have used the levers of political control over natural resources to their advantage, regardless of ecological effects. They want to make it easier for hunters to kill moose and caribou by increasing their populations, even though, as the director of Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation admits, &quot;there are no real shortages of big-game animals in Alaska.&quot; This is the predictable result of bureaucratic management in a political environment.</P><P>     As public-choice economics teaches, more than ecological concerns are being sacrificed to special interests.</P><P>     The consequences, while clear for the wolves, may be equally bleak for Alaska's reputation for its important tourist economy. The state has already received &quot;hundred of letters&quot; protesting the plan. Last week, the National Parks and Conservation Association canceled its 75th anniversary board meeting scheduled for Anchorage. A decline in tourism may match the decrease in wolf population.</P><P>     By responding to a small, vocal constituency, Alaska's government may have damaged a far broader, but less-well-organized and focused group. This decision once again illustrates the pitfalls of political-bureaucratic natural resource management, where special interests can run the decision-making apparatus to their benefit while ignoring the costs imposed on many.</P><P>     The Alaskan wolf example demonstrates that sound environmentalism must recognize the dangers of political management. In a greener political economy, environmental management should be guided by science and constrained by economic realities. We can learn from Alaska. </P>

BADEN</P><P>           IS RANCHING on the federal range an environmentally destructive anachronism? Many environmentalists seem to think so. Less than 30,000 ranchers graze cattle on 350 million acres of federal lands, an area twice the size of Texas. Environmentalists hope the public lands will be, as the bumper sticker intones, &quot;Cattle Free by '93.&quot;</P><P>         Grazing has also been the target of budget reformers; grazing programs subsidize what environmental writer Edward Abbey called &quot;welfare cowboys.&quot; These programs cost taxpayers about $50 million a year. Some permit holders, however, have found public lands to be quite profitable.</P><P>     A recent report by the Department of the Interior highlights one case in which a California public utility subleased its public grazing privileges to ranchers. It charged subleases 315 percent more per animal unit month than it paid to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the grazing permits. The bottom line: The public loses money to permit holders' benefit.</P><P>     Ranchers are politically powerful and have successfully headed off attempts at fee reform. Last September, for example, a modest fee increase approved by the House was subsequently negotiated away by the Senate. Today grazing rates remain at about one-quarter of the average of private lands in the same region.</P><P>     The answer seems to be raising grazing fees to the market level. Ethically and economically, it is not that simple.</P><P>     BLM grazing privileges were assigned to ranchers under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. Preference was given to nearby landowners. Over time, grazing privileges have become linked to these &quot;base properties,&quot; with leases being routinely renewed. Today the permits are virtually owned by the base property holders, though technically given as &quot;privileges&quot; by the BLM.</P><P>     This &quot;ownership&quot; has been ratified in a number of ways. The value of the grazing permits is taxed by the Internal Revenue Service when a ranch is inherited. Permits are also accepted by FDIC-insured banks as collateral for loans. And they are routinely transferred to new owners by the BLM when a base property is sold. Over time, the value of these &quot;rights&quot; has been incorporated into the value of associated private ranch lands.</P><P>     Consider this analogy: Two cars are auctioned. They are identical in every way except that one carries a sticker entitling it to half-price gasoline for the life of the automobile. Surely the cheaper gasoline does not come free; the discount on gas will produce higher bids for the car. Gas or grass, it works the same. A ranch sold with federal grazing permits is worth more than one without permits. An economist would say that the value of access to cheap grass becomes capitalized into the ranch's value.</P><P>     So those who have received a subsidy are those who got the initial windfall and sold out for a higher price. Many ranchers who own the base properties today have paid for their subsidy, which makes it no subsidy at all. As the director of the BLM wrote, &quot;The point is that we simply do not know who is `unduly' benefiting or if they are benefiting at all.&quot;</P><P>       Simply raising grazing fees is unfair to the ranchers who have paid for cheap government-land grazing through the value capitalized into their ranch's purchase price. So how else can we reform the federal grazing lands?</P><P>       A free market in permits can help end government subsidies in a just way. Grazing permits could be offered to the current ranchers for the value of future grazing fees. The permits could then be freely exchanged.</P><P>     The federal government would stop subsidizing management of the land but would still own it and set environmental standards; for example, by requiring protection of riparian areas as a condition of holding permits.</P><P>     Environmentalists have long pointed out that there are many valuable uses for federal lands, among them recreation and wildlife habitat. The current system's &quot;use it or lose it&quot; requirements effectively prevent shifts from cattle to other uses. A permit holder cannot save winter range for elk and other wildlife because even if the grazing fees are paid, the permits may be revoked and &quot;unused&quot; forage reallocated to another ranch.</P><P>     A transferable permit system would encourage diverse uses. Grazing would continue, but land would surely be dedicated to esthetics and biodiversity by groups like the North American Elk Foundation or the Nature Conservancy.</P><P>     There are several benefits of owned and transferable permits. For example, with more secure access, permit holders would have incentives to invest in and improve the public lands. Property rights encourage diversity and provide incentives for stewardship. This change will benefit our range land and the people who care about its diverse values.</P><P> _______________</P><P> John A.

Family Hour<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
Not so long ago the first hour of each night's prime time television
schedule -- the so-called Family Hour -- was reserved for wholesome
programs. This is now a thing of the past, mostly crowded out
by sexy sitcoms and steamy soaps, the likes of which as a rule
used to air later at night.
<P>
How much has the family hour changed since it was dominated by
such series as <I>Little House on the Prairie</I> and <I>The Cosby
Show</I>? In September and October of 1995, the Media Research
Center examined four weeks of 8-to-9-p.m. programming to determine
how much of it was, in fact, suitable for the entire family. We
found that very little of it was.
<P>
Among the study's findings:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Vulgar language,
usually unheard even late in prime time a few years back, is now
constant in the 8 p.m. hour. In 117 hours of programming, 72 curse
words were used. &quot;Ass&quot; (29 uses) &quot;bitch&quot; (13)
and &quot;bastard&quot; (10) were the most popular.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  NBC was by far the
most vulgar of the networks. It had 1.26 obscenities for every
hour of &quot;Family Hour&quot; programming, more than double
the ratio of any other network. NBC's worst offenders were <I>Mad
About You</I>, with seven curse words, and <I>JAG</I>, with six.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Sexual material that
formerly was restricted to the 9-to-11 slot has migrated to the
&quot;Family Hour,&quot; where premarital sex is not only common
-- outnumbering portrayals of sex within marriage by a 8-to-1
ratio -- but almost always condoned. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Fox had the most
sexual treatments per hour of any network (0.88), though all four
major networks were closely bunched in this category.
<P>
The networks' attempt to appeal to young adults has left children
(and their parents) underserved. The study's first recommendation
is a short-term, partial solution to this problem: one network
should counter the adult trend by offering family-oriented programming
between 8 and 9 throughout the week. 
<P>
In the long term, however, the goal should be for all networks
to voluntarily provide the viewing public with the across-the-board
haven it once counted on, and to broadcast in the first hour of
prime time only shows that parents and children can watch together.

extramarital sex is shown to have devastating effects, main characters

</ol>
<p>
<a name= "1">  <dd>
<dd>
1) Having earlier found ABC News had committed fraud, on
Wednesday a federal jury in North Carolina awarded Food Lion $5.5
million in punitive damages for an undercover story aired on Prime
Time Live in 1992. Instead of filing a very hard to win libel
suit, which would have required Food Lion to prove malice, Food
Lion sued for fraud and trespass based upon how ABC producers
misrepresented themselves to get hired.<p>
<dd>
Food Lion obtained video outtakes which showed how ABC misled
viewers, but network stories Wednesday night insisted the accuracy
of ABC's story was beyond argument and, therefore, the decision
would have a chilling effect.<p>

On the January 22 CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced:<p>
<dd>
"A federal jury in North Carolina ordered ABC television today
to pay the Food Lion supermarkets five and a half million dollars
in punitive damages, that's in connection with an undercover news
investigation that proved to be true. But ABC News producers
covered their true identities to get jobs at Food Lion and jurors
decided that amounted to fraud."<p>
<dd>
After soundbites from two jurors, Rather continued:
"The ABC report accused Food Lion of selling spoiled food and
other unsanitary practices. Important to note that the truth of
the report was never at issue in the lawsuit, not even challenged,
only the journalistic techniques. ABC is appealing the verdict and
ABC News President Roone Arledge says, and I quote, 'If large
corporations were allowed to stop hard-hitting investigative
journalism, the American people would be the losers.'"<p> <dd>
The network in question, ABC, gave a fuller view of the issues
involved. Reporter John McKenzie began his story:<p>
<dd> 
"The jurors had already found ABC guilty of fraudulent job applications and
trespassing. Today's award, they said, was meant to send
journalists a message." Following two juror soundbites McKenzie
allowed Chris Ahearn of Food Lion to assert: "This case was about
wrongdoing on the part of ABC and the jury agreed with Food Lion
that ABC broke laws and today they agreed that ABC needed to be
punished for that illegal activity."<p>
<dd>
A bit later in the piece ABC News President Roone Arledge
expressed the widely held all or nothing media view:<p>
<dd>
"From the beginning, Food Lion has never been able to attack
the story itself. They have gone about attacking us because of the
way we gathered it. The reason that the award today is outrageous
is that this is precisely the kind of story for which
investigative techniques like these are appropriate."<p>
<dd>Arledge failed to consider another spin: Undercover reporting
that accurately and fairly documents wrongdoing is fine, but the public
doesn't approve of the media abusing its power and then delivering a
distorted story.<p>
<BR>
On NBC Nightly News Tom Brokaw declared:<p>
<dd>
 "NBC News In Depth tonight, Food Lion versus ABC -- punishing the messenger..."
    But reporter Bob Faw proceeded to provide the only story of
the night which explored why the media have turned off the public.<p><dd>
Faw began: "Insisting it had broadcast the truth, ABC said every American
should be troubled by the decision. One..."<p><dd>
    Bill Jeffries, ABC lawyer: "that vastly exceeds the actual
damages incurred by Food Lion."<p><dd>
    Faw: "That, said jurors, misses the point."<p><dd>
    Juror: "They're going to have to go about gathering the news
in a different way. You can't misrepresent yourself just to get
the news."<p><dd>
    Faw: "What we love on television, we condemn in the jury box."<p><dd>
    Faw went on to explain that the public believes the media
violate people's privacy, have a superior attitude and employ
trickery. Faw ran a soundbite from Richard Jewell and then let
former Senator Alan Simpson assert that investigative reports are
not done to reveal the truth but "to draw blood."<p><dd>
    Faw explained: "And, when like ABC, the press piously
proclaims that the ends justify the means, the public and jurors
say no, it does not."<p><dd>
   <b><I> MRC Chairman Brent Bozell</I></b>: "There's a growing sense of
alienation between the public and the press."<p><dd>
    Faw: "A public which ironically continues to say it wants the
media to catch the bad guys. Now, say investigative reporters,
that will be harder."<p><dd>
    Jane Kirtley: Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press:
"A decision like this is going to have a great chilling effect on
news organizations pursuing stories like this."<p><dd>
    Faw: "A decision where jurors said candid camera yes, sucker
punch no."<p><dd>
    Tom Brokaw then interviewed Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, who
insisted: "This is an alarming case because what it suggests is that you
can do a report that is substantially accurate and still be
penalized for it. And that can set a chilling precedent for
stories that news organizations want to do that might cause a lot
of opposition on the part of the subjects of the story."<p><dd>
   
 Instead of considering whether ABC went too far, Brokaw asked:
"Is there any doubt in your mind that we have to work a little
harder at getting the public to understand just what we do and why
we do it?"<p><br>
<a name="2"><dd>
2) But just how "true" and "accuate" was ABC's story? In the 
January 20 New Republic William Powers reported that "as part of the 
suit, Food Lion had obtained the full forty-five hours of hidden-camera
videotape shot by the Prime Time Live producers, of which only
about ten minutes wound up in the segment." Food Lion contended
that "ABC producers and editors used a combination of staged
events and selective editing to fit a pre-conceived story line and
systematically fabricate a story to deceive the public."<dd>
    Powers explained: "In one case found in the outtakes shown by
Food Lion in court, an ABC employee sold a piece of moldy kielbasa
sausage to two other ABC employees, while both parties to the
transaction filmed it with hidden cameras."<p>
<dd>
    Food Lion could not release this video while it was evidence,
but AP reported that after Wednesday's verdict they distributed a
highlight tape to reporters. <p><dd>
    Powers suggested why news magazines have an incentive to
exaggerate what they discover: 
<dd>
    "These hidden-camera investigations are costly, and it's hard
for producers to go back to the office and say the sorts of things
newspaper reporters tell their editors all the time: 'the story
didn't really pan out'....Unlike newspapers, the networks don't
have subscribers who will be back for the next edition no matter
what, and they can't bury a less than fab story on page B-19. They
have to draw in a large audience for every show, or risk losing
ratings and advertisers. And they do so by painting broad,
sensational strokes."<p><dd>
    For more on ABC's manipulations, see item #5 below.<p><br>
<a name= "3">
<dd>
3) In addition to the $5.5 million, the jury demanded that
Rick Kaplan, Executive Producer of Prime Time Live at the time of
the Food Lion story, pay $35,000. Food Lion had argued that Prime
Time producers had benefitted personally from the story. As
reported in the January 8 USA Today: <dd>
    "Food Lion's Mike Mueller said Prime Time Live employees who
worked on the story got big raises. Producer Susan Barnett, he
said, got a raise from $49,400 to $70,000 the day after she was
named in the suit in 1993. Producer Lynne Dale's pay rose from
$72,900 in 1992 to $100,000 in 1993. Other salary figures, to
which ABC did not object, showed that in 1993, former Executive
Producer Rick Kaplan made $700,000."<p>
<dd>
    Kaplan may soon take a top slot at CNN. Kaplan is now a
special events producer for ABC Television. He left Prime Time
Live in 1994 to become Executive Producer of World News Tonight
where he remained until about a year ago. <p><dd>

    Back on January 3 The Washington Post's John Carmody reported
that Kaplan "is being eagerly sought to take over a major job at
the 24-hour channel," elaborating that "speculation in Atlanta has
Kaplan being put in charge of all CNN programs and program
development."<p><dd>

    As examined in MediaWatch a few years ago, Kaplan is a Friend
of Bill who advised Clinton during the 1992 campaign -- a time
when Kaplan was working for ABC News. Here's an except from the
front page story in the January 1994 MediaWatch:<p><dd>

Kaplan, Executive Producer of Prime Time Live since 1989, advised
Clinton in 1992. When the Gennifer Flowers story broke in
February, "Clinton called Kaplan for advice," Los Angeles Times
reporter Tom Rosenstiel recounted in his campaign book Strange
Bedfellows. On the way to the airport, Clinton made another call
to Kaplan and the "night ended for Kaplan at 4am, when Clinton
called one last time."<p> 
Rosenstiel reported that Clinton "was considering doing 60
Minutes. If you do, Kaplan said, it should be with Mike Wallace or
Morley Safer or Ed Bradley. Otherwise tell them forget
it....[Voters] are going to remember that you stood up to Mike
Wallace."<p> 
Two months later as Clinton's campaign floundered in New York,
aides suggested an appearance on the Don Imus show. "The
appearance was clinched," CNN producer Matthew Saal recalled in
the January 1993 Washington Monthly, "when Rick Kaplan... called
the radio show host to see if he could get the pair together. The
answer was yes."<p> 
Kaplan's closeness has impacted coverage. In a March 11 Prime Time
Live story, Sam Donaldson explained that he added a positive
remark at the end of a pre-election Clinton interview because
Kaplan said "the overall [interview] atmosphere was too tough." In
the March 21 Washington Post Magazine, David Finkel quoted Kaplan
as he watched Donaldson's interview: "I'd just like to do this one
over again...I'm getting angry watching this...You didn't treat
Bush this way."<p> 
Kaplan kept up his cozy relationship after the election. He
"played golf with Bill shortly before the inauguration and watched
movies with both Clintons at the Governor's mansion," Jacob
Weisberg reported in the April 26 New Republic.<p><BR>
<a name= "4">
<dd>
4) While Kaplan may soon join CNN's ranks, the cable network
has just landed another network liberal: Garrick Utley. The New
York Post's Josef Adalian reported that Utley, Chief Foreign
Correspondent for ABC News since 1993, will work out of CNN's New
York bureau starting next month. Before ABC Utley spent 30 years
with NBC News as a reporter, anchor and for a little while, host
of Meet the Press.<p><dd>

    What views does Utley hold? Well, some quotes run in past
issues of Notable Quotables show he's not very conservative.<p><dd>

    Utley anchoring the October 17, 1992 NBC Nightly News:
<dd>    "When I covered Bush's 1980 primary campaign against Ronald
Reagan, he opposed Reagan's economic program. He called it 'voodoo
economics' -- said it wouldn't work. But then of course, Bush
agreed to be Reagan's running mate. For eight years, he supported
policies which, it is now widely acknowledged, contributed
mightily to our excesses then and our economic problems now; above
all, America being held hostage by debt. George Bush went along to
get ahead, and it worked. He became President. Now Ronald Reagan
is in happy retirement in California, and President Bush is left
to pay the price. The price for supporting something he did not
believe in to begin with. He knows it -- knows it is now too late
to do anything about that fateful bargain he entered into twelve
years ago. Going along to get ahead made George Bush President.
Now it may unmake him. The ancient Greeks wrote about this sort of
thing. They called it tragedy." <p><dd>

    Utley anchoring the January 25, 1992 NBC Nightly News:<dd>
    "Yes, times are tough because of mistakes we made in the past,
including voodoo economics supported by George Bush, among
others."<p> <dd>

    And to think that on Sunday's 60 Minutes Ted Turner complained
about how Rupert Murdoch infected the Fox News Channel with a
conservative tilt. -- Brent Baker <p>

<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) Many of you received two or three copies of the last 
CyberAlert. You aren't on our list more than once, CompuServe 
just sent out multiple copies, some blindcopied and some not. 
CompuServe is unable to tell me when this problem will be 
resolved and is not providing any short term solution, though 
they assure me it is "a high priority of the mail developers." 
This has been a problem for over a month now.
<br>
<dd>    
Everything works fine for those with a CompuServe address. I 
thought about sending this message CC to everyone since that 
would eliminate the long double-spaced list, but many e-mail 
systems (including AOL) put the Apparently To list after the 
message and CCing this would put all the addresses up top.
<br>
<dd>    
I have made my displeasure known to CompuServe, but three 
work days have passed since the last CyberAlert and the problem 
has not been resolved. Given the timeliness of the Gingrich/cell
phone and Paula Jones material and the fact that many of you have 
e-mailed to say that while annoying you'd rather get than not get 
CyberAlerts, I'm going ahead with today's edition.  
<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) A husband and wife active in Democratic politics by 
"coincidence" come across and record a cellular conversation 
among House Republicans. Even if the recording of the over the 
air broadcast is legal, the Democratic activists violate the law 
by passing the tape to a third party -- a top House Democrat, 
Rep. Jim McDermott. Instead of alerting authorities or refusing 
the tape, it ends up in the New York Times. 
<br>
<dd>    
But what most interests the media? Not exploring this series 
of immoral, unethical and/or illegal events. No, the networks 
worry that this controversy is "distracting" the focusing from 
Gingrich's ethics. 
<p>
<dd>
On Monday night's CBS Evening News (January 13) Dan Rather 
introduced a story by focusing not on the ethics of Democrats but 
on how Republicans are guilty of trying to change topics:  
<br>
<dd>    
"On Capitol Hill the House today was supposed to begin making 
full disclosure of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethical 
violations and tax problems. It didn't. And what's more, now 
there's an added ethics allegation based on what Gingrich said, 
in what he thought was a secret telephone call, which Democrats 
say is proof that Gingrich violated a promise to the House ethics 
committee not to mount a political damage control effort. But 
Republicans tried to shift the focus today away from what 
Gingrich actually said. Bob Schieffer has the latest."
<p>
<dd>
The next night, on the January 14 CBS Evening News, reporter 
Wyatt Andrews demonstrated how easy it is to tune in a cellular 
call and reviewed how the Martins claimed they caught the call, 
then concluded his piece: 
<br>
<dd>    
"...So now the Martins could be charged with a crime. 
Congressman James McDermott, who leaked the tape, could be 
charged with a crime and ironically, in the ways of Washington, 
mini-tapegate has for five days sidetracked substantive ethics 
charges against the Speaker of the House."  
<p>
<dd>
Wednesday night coverage of tapegate? Not a word on ABC's 
World News Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Not all sexual harassment is an evil that must be 
immediately redressed -- at least according to Time magazine's 
Margaret Carlson. Discussing whether the Supreme Court should 
delay the Paula Jones case until after President Clinton leaves 
office, Carlson opined on the January 12 Fox News Sunday:
<br>
<dd>    
"It also depends on the degree of harm. In fact, she didn't 
lose her job, she got her promotions. There's no claim of harm."
<br>
<dd>    
Not quite the media view of Anita Hill who took ten years to 
make her charge.
<p>
<dd>
The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Monday. That 
night on the CBS Evening News Rita Braver reviewed the history of 
the case: 
<p>
<dd>    
Braver began: "It was the women's vote that clinched the 
presidency for Bill Clinton and he prides himself on being a 
committed feminist. So the charges made by Paula Corbin Jones go 
straight to the heart of who Bill Clinton is. Because she claims 
he is the kind of man who would take advantage of a young woman, 
who would sexually harass her..."
<p>
<dd>
Question: If this long-scheduled case goes "straight to the 
heart of who Bill Clinton is" then why didn't CBS explore this 
subject last fall, BEFORE the election?
<p>
<dd>
Braver continued: "...But last fall, in a groundbreaking 
article, respected law reporter Stuart Taylor tracked down 
several new witnesses whose testimony persuaded him that Jones 
was probably telling the truth. And he noticed something else: 
women's groups who like Bill Clinton's policies had failed to 
rally to Jones's cause." 
<p>
<dd>
Taylor's story, with the new witness accounts, came out in 
late October. If the article was so "groundbreaking" why did CBS 
wait over ten weeks to report anything about it? 
<p>
<dd>
On Monday's NBC Nightly News Jim Miklaszewski noted in his 
overview of the case that when Jones first made her charges "Most 
mainstream media barely touched it. Others, like Newsweek's Evan 
Thomas, fell for the White House spin." 
<br>
<dd>    
Following a soundbite from Thomas, the Mik continued: "But an 
investigation by American Lawyer magazine showed that Paula Jones 
appeared to have a strong case for sexual harassment, even 
stronger than Anita Hill's claim against Justice Clarence Thomas. 
Reporter Stuart Taylor blames the media's initial negative 
reaction to Jones on political and cultural bias."
<br>
<dd>    
Taylor: "She was widely dismissed in the back rooms of the 
press conversations as Southern trailer park trash. Why should we 
listen to her."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski: "And by the time Jones' case hit the Supreme 
Court she made the cover of Newsweek."
<br>
<dd>    
Thomas: "If you really look at the facts of the case she is 
worth taking seriously."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski: "Paula Jones's attorneys say there's still time 
to cut a deal and avoid a trial if President Clinton would 
apologize. The President's lawyers had no comment."
<p>
<dd>
As with CBS, Taylor (who was on Meet the Press Sunday) made 
his first Nightly News appearance two and a half months after his 
article appeared. It's nice that some in the media are 
acknowledging their bias, at least with this issue, but may I 
suggest that their failure to report anything about Taylor's 
story reflects a continuation of that bias more than two years 
after Jones filed her suit in May 1994. 
<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Wednesday's Washington Times and USA Today carried 
stories on how Vice President Al Gore admitted to the AP that he 
used "a poor choice of words" when he insisted an April 1996 
fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple was nothing more than a 
"community outreach" event. The AP noted that three days before 
the event the DNC sent Gore a memo explaining how he should 
"extend appreciation for participant support and inspire 
political and fundraising efforts."
<p>
<dd>
Network coverage for this admission of earlier false 
statements? A full story by Brooks Jackson on CNN, but no mention 
on the Tuesday or Wednesday ABC, CBS and NBC evening news shows.
<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Weekend on Saturday, 
January 4 NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell suggested the issue 
of large donors staying overnight at the White House will become 
a big issue in 1997. As transcribed by since-departed MRC intern 
Jessica Anderson, Mitchell asserted:
<br>
<dd>    
"I've been working on that story and I kind of think that 
even though Republicans in the past have had their big 
contributors and have abused the soft money contributions, the 
money that doesn't have to be accounted for, people understand 
the selling of the Lincoln bedroom. You know, when the Lincoln 
bedroom becomes the Motel 6, that resonates with the American 
people."
<p>
<dd>
How will this "resonate" with the American people when the 
story Mitchell claims she's "been working on" has yet to be 
reported by her? The Washington Post revealed the Motel 6 
arrangements in a front page story on Sunday, December 15. Today 
show that morning and the next: no mention. There was no NBC 
Nightly News Sunday night on the east coast, but the next night 
NBC did run a Mitchell piece on Clinton's defense fund returning 
donations. On December 17 Mitchell contributed another story on 
the defense fund. She didn't do another political story until 
January 3, but still no mention of the Lincoln Bedroom.
<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) The Motel 6 story isn't the only Clinton scandal news 
ignored by NBC Nightly News. The day after Christmas the 
Democratic National Committee released a huge pile of documents 
on their fundraising activities. The papers showed how foreign 
donors to the DNC got special access to the White House and 
Clinton. The New York Times ran a big piece on the December 27 
front page. The Washington Post ran a lengthy story on December 
29. 
<br>
<dd>
The December 26 CBS Evening News led with the revelations and 
followed up with another story the next night. But not ABC or 
NBC. Neither ABC's World News Tonight or the NBC Nightly News 
uttered a word either night about the latest embarrassing 
revelation for Clinton. On December 27 ABC did run a story on 
Newt Gingrich losing support. John Cochran concluded: "Everyone, 
Republican and Democrat alike, agrees Gingrich is fortunate that 
his troubles have come over the holidays when most Americans 
aren't paying much attention." When it came to Clinton, ABC wasn't 
paying attention.
<p>
<dd>
Examining the same papers, in a front page USA Today story on 
December 30, reporter Tom Squitieri relayed: 
<br>
<dd>   
"The documents also show that Democrats were ready in case 
questions arose about the strategy [of coordinating DNC, White 
House and Clinton-Gore campaign activities to maximize 
fundraising.] For example, those caught in scandals were advised 
'don't lie' in one DNC memo. Next they were to 'announce an 
internal investigation, independent investigation or white paper 
to examine the matter' in order to buy time. Finally, they were 
to 'impugn the source,' the DNC advised."
<p>
<dd>
Network coverage of this cynical and divisive plan? Zilch. 
<P>

7) Dan Rather was the guest on Monday's Larry King Live on 
CNN (January 13). Here's a very illuminating exchange:
<br>
<dd>    
Larry King: "I'm told by our producers, that a lot of calls, 
so rather than make it microscopic here, are complaining about 
advocates being hired by television stations. Shapiro was on one 
side in the Simpson trial, he's hired. Stephanopoulos is now at 
ABC -- that we're not getting balance."
<br>
<dd>    
Dan Rather: "I think that's a valid criticism. I'm concerned 
about it. Look, a Bill Moyers came out of the Lyndon Johnson 
White House and became one of the great journalists of all time."
<br>
<dd>    
King: "But a major liberal, self-confessed."
<br>
<dd>    
Rather: "Ah, is he? I don't want to get into that, but he was 
terrific. I do think, personal opinion, it's gone too far. Here's 
what concerns me. In some cases, and I don't exclude CBS News 
from this criticism, what happens is they're brought on to, and 
they're allowed to give their opinion on the air and we don't say 
this is their opinion. They go into some political or highly 
partisan ideological rant, from where I sit. I have no objection 
to that being done, but I think it needs to be clearly labeled 
and also the other side or other sides need to be given a chance. 
I think this is valid criticism. I'm glad to hear the public is 
picking up on it."
<p>
<dd>
Good to hear that after 15 years as anchor Rather has finally 
noticed that the "public is picking up" on media bias.
<p>
<dd>
Back in 1989 PBS re-ran an anti-Reagan 1982 CBS Reports 
special narrated by Moyers. After the show, Moyers announced: 
"The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. 
While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first 
Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor 
have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The 
hardest hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-
poverty measures...Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And 
the middle class kept most of its subsidies intact. As a result, 
the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."
<p>
<dd>
Even Larry King realizes that's liberal.

     1) CompuServe has solved the problem that led to all those 
Apparently To lines that many of you received in the last four 
CyberAlerts. I've tested messages to two non-CompuServe e-mail 
addresses I have and all seems to work as it did before this 
problem arose in mid-December. 
<BR>
<DD>    
	Since the last CyberAlert my computer, on which the address 
list is saved, died. As a result, with the help of interns Joe 
Alfonsi and Jessica Anderson, we've restored the list from a 
couple of weeks old back up copy. But, some of you may now get 
two copies and others who had unsubscribed may be on the list.  
Please reply and we'll fix the error.
<BR>
<DD>
<P>
<a name="2">
    2) The January 10 New York Times ran a transcript of a 
December 21 phone call among top Republican aides and 
Congressmen, including Newt Gingrich. At least one participant 
was on a cellular phone in Florida, allowing someone there to 
pick up and record the call. 
<BR>
<DD>
    Anyone can monitor any communications in the airwaves from 
phone calls to police dispatching, but it's always violated 
federal law to divulge information you hear to a third party or 
to use it to evade law enforcement officers. However a few years 
ago Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
which specifically banned the sale of equipment that could 
receive cellular frequencies (though it is still legal to listen 
in since any such ban would never stand constitutional 
challenge). Although the ECPA is really meaningless since the way 
scanners work allow you to easily overcome this block, the New 
York Times must know that by publishing the transcript in 
probable violation of both communications and phone wiretap laws 
it helped facilitate a felony by who ever gave them the tape. Law 
enforcement officials must get a warrant before they can tape 
cellular calls.
<BR>
<DD>
    But the ethics of the New York Times' isn't what 
concerned Dan Rather Friday night. He stuck to Gingrich. On the 
January 10 CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced: "In Washington 
not just one but two bizarre new twists in the Newt Gingrich 
ethics and tax case. One could further delay public disclosure of 
the details of Gingrich's ethics violations and tax problems at 
an open hearing. The other raises a whole new ethics question 
about Speaker Gingrich. At issue, what he allegedly said in a 
secretly recorded telephone call. From Capitol Hill, Bob 
Schieffer is your guide to these latest twists and turns." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Schieffer reported: "Adding to the turmoil, the New York 
Times got a tape, apparently picked up by a police scanner in 
which Gingrich and top lieutenants are heard on a cell phone 
planning a public relations campaign to counter committee 
allegations, something Gingrich had promised the committee he 
would not do."
<BR>
<DD>    
	Following a soundbite from Republican Congessman John Boehner, 
Schieffer did mote that "Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde 
and other Republicans cried foul and urged the Attorney General to 
investigate where the tape came from."
<P>
<a name="3">

    3) On Monday the Supreme Court will hear arguments as to 
whether a President can be subjected while in office to a civil 
lawsuit. When decided later this year the Court will determine 
whether Paula Jones can proceed with her sexual harassment suit 
against Bill Clinton. Sunday's Face the Nation, This Week and 
Late Edition are scheduled to take up the Jones case, but...
<BR>
<DD>
    Three weeks before the Speaker vote the networks began 
running stories on ethical charges surrounding Newt Gingrich. The 
networks have provided no such coverage in the weeks leading up to the 
Jones case. Through Friday night the network evening news shows 
had yet to do a story on Paula Jones, though the January 7 CNN 
Inside Politics ran a piece by Bruce Morton on media coverage of 
her case that included a soundbite from the MRC's Tim Graham. 
Tonight (Saturday) neither ABC's World News Saturady or the NBC 
Nightly News mentioned Jones. (The CBS Evening News did bring on 
consultant Laura Ingraham to discuss the topic.)
<BR>
<DD>
    Still, on Friday's (January 10) Washington Week in Review on 
PBS host Ken Bode asserted: "Paula Jones, of all the things the 
Clinton White House faces - Filegate, Travelgate, Asian money  -- 
this is the one the White House seems most worried about. The 
coverage of the Paula Jones case languished until the American 
Lawyer magazine ran this cover story by Stuart Taylor called `Her 
Case Against Clinton.' And this week Newsweek put Paula Jones on 
the cover."
<BR>
<DD>
    Yes, Newsweek did put Jones on the cover this week, but the 
Stuart Taylor piece on the controversy Bode says "the White House 
seems most worried about," did not generate a single broadcast 
network news story other than a portion of one ABC story. Back on 
October 31 ABC's World News Tonight ran a story by Jeff 
Greenfield on why scandals don't hurt Clinton. Among the reasons 
he listed was liberal bias and to illustrate he allowed Stuart 
Taylor to charge: "Imagine if Paula Jones or someone just like 
her made allegations, just like this, with evidence just like 
this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich." In the American 
Lawyer Taylor concluded that "the evidence supporting Paula 
Jones's allegations of predatory, if not depraved, behavior by 
Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita 
Hill's allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence 
Thomas."
<P>
<a name="4">

     4) While on the non-coverage topic, MediaWatch Associate 
Editor Tim Graham suggested a review of how the media in 1994 
treated the Jones charge. 
<BR>
<DD>
    The June 1994 MediaWatch Study detailed the differences in 
reaction to Anita Hill and Paula Jones. MediaWatch examined the 
ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows, plus the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour 
and CNN's World News. MediaWatch explained: "On Sunday, October 
6, 1991 Anita Hill's story broke. In the five days before 
hearings began (October 6-10), all the networks led with Hill 
every night except CNN, which led with the story three times...
The five programs aired 67 stories in five days...
<BR>
<DD>    "When Paula Jones announced her charges on February 11 this 
year [1994], only ABC reported the story -- for 16 seconds. That's 
67 to 1. None of the evening shows touched it again until May 4, 
the day The Washington Post ran its long-delayed investigation of 
Jones. CNN's Wolf Blitzer led World News with it. ABC and CNN 
read brief stories on May 5. On May 6, the day Jones filed suit, 
all five networks covered the story, but none led the newscast 
with it. Only ABC and PBS did more than one story. In the first 
six days of the Jones story -- May 4-9 -- the networks reported 15 
stories, or less than three stories a day, for a Hill-Jones ratio 
of 67 to 15."
<P>
<a name="5">

     5) Dan Rather announced on the January 8 CBS Evening News: 
"In Miami today an armored truck overturned on an overpass and 
its doors flew open. Millions of dollars in bills and coins 
spilled out and before police could get control of the situation, 
hundreds people moved in and helped themselves to as much cash as 
they could grab. No tally yet on how much was actually lost."

    Rather provided a straight-forward report. But not ABC's 
Peter Jennings who felt compelled to put the story of thievery 
into a moral relativism/sociological analysis that suggested 
the thieves were justified: 
    "In Miami today, in the poor section of the city called 
Overtown, an armored car carrying a great deal of money flipped 
over during the morning rush hour. The police describe what 
happened next as pandemonium."
    Then, as viewers saw video of the scene, Jennings continued:
"It is a poor and needy neighborhood where the Brinks truck 
turned over and the money came tumbling out."
    Police officer: "Apparently, the word has spread that 
something like Pennies from Heaven."
    Jennings: "Quarters actually, along with the bills. Four 
hundred thousand dollars is missing according to Brinks. And 
while keeping any of the money certainly constitutes theft, many 
people here thought it was clearly more about need and good 
fortune."
    Man: "I think the whole neighborhood's up here this morning. 
I did deserve it. You know, these hard working people don't make 
enough money. God sent a truck."
    Jennings: "A Brinks team came in to recover what they could -
- they're the ones with the shovels -- but people were still 
searching by hand several hours later."

<P>
<a name="6">
     6) On NBC's Tonight Show with Jay Leno Wednesday night 
(January 8) ABC's Sam Donaldson compared Newt Gingrich's 
political strategy to Lenin's murderous tyranny: 
    "You know, the real smart guys are the ones who don't walk in the 
room and say, 'I'm the smart guy, I'm so brilliant.' They walk in 
the room and they let you find it out for, and you come in and 
say, 'Hey, you're a smart guy,' and they say, 'Oh, no, no, not 
me,' and then they . . . [trails off] Newt Gingrich's problem, 
I've always thought, he's like Lenin. They both made a revolution 
by shooting people -- Newt shot Democrats, Lenin shot everybody -- 
and then they didn't have sense enough to stop shooting once they 
won. So, I mean, once you win, you say, 'Okay, now I've shot all 
your relatives, but you're a good guy, let's work together.' 
Instead, Newt shut down the government and kept on trying to 
shoot Democrats."

    Imagine the reaction if Newt joked about how Bill Clinton 
acted like Hitler.  

<P>
<a name="7">
     7) It's barely been a week since the networks began 
providing ratings for their entertainment shows to help guide 
parents. But what do the ratings really mean? Most shows have 
been tagged as "TVPG" with fewer getting the more mild "TVG" to 
identify shows okay everyone to watch or the "TV14" rating for 
shows producers feel is inappropriate for those under 14.
<BR>
    CBS rates the Late Show with David Letterman a "TVPG." I'm a 
big Letterman fan and at 11:35pm ET it's aimed at an adult/older 
teen audience. So, is TVPG the correct rating for a show which 
included the following comedy bit Friday night?
<BR>
<DD>    During the letters from viewers segment Letterman read one 
which asked: "Is Andy Rooney older than the Statue of Liberty?"
Letterman said that the question provided an opportunity to 
introduce a new segment called "Biff Henderson, Resident Genius."
    Biff Henderson, a stagehand, then responded: "Dave, let me 
ask you a question. Do you have a mirror?"
    Letterman: "A mirror, no, not on me, why Biff?"
    Biff Henderson: "Because I want to see if I look like I give 
a rat's ass."
    Letterman: "That doesn't sound much like Biff Henderson, 
Resident Genius."
    Biff Henderson: "Oh, I'm sorry Dave. I thought we were doing 
Biff Henderson, Quick-Witted Son of a Bitch."
<BR>
<DD>
    You have to be 16 to sit in Letterman's Ed Sullivan Theater 
audience.

<a name="1">
1) "Conservatives dislike Gumbel so much that he's a regular
in the Media Research Center's bi-weekly Notable Quotables, a
compilation of comments by the 'liberal media.'" So noted USA
Today's Peter Johnson in a January 2 front page story. After a
quote from the MRC's Brent Bozell on Gumbel's ideology, Gumbel
defended himself but in so doing more than confirmed that he's a
dedicated liberal:
<BR>
<DD>    
"I don't know if I have a liberal bent,' Gumbel says. 'But if
it is fair to say it's very difficult for a black man in this
country to be of a conservative bent. That's a fair statement.
It's very difficult to be an African-American male, and have an
African-American son who is going to be 18 years of age, and hear
things like cops want to crack down and send more to prison, to
hear calls for tougher statutes, less welfare, less programs for
the poor, and less things for people of color. If that says I'm
not conservative, so be it."
<BR>
<DD>   
One wonders how welfare reform or arresting criminals will personally
impact a millionaire and his law-abiding family.
<BR>
<DD>   
The compilation of Gumbel quotes sent with the last CyberAlert
has led to some significant play for the quotes, including a
Washington Times editorial on Friday and a column Sunday in the
Ft. Worth Star-Telegram by WBAP's Mark Davis.
<P>
<a name="2">
2) In the midst of NBC's Friday morning (January 3) Today
tribute to Bryant Gumbel (which featured a lot of kissing among
men), Gumbel's replacement, Matt Lauer, offered some effusive
praise. As caught by MRC analyst Jim Forbes, Lauer asserted: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"I'm gonna tell you that in my opinion and many other opinions
you are the best interviewer on television, you are fair, you are
compassionate, you're probing, you always do the right thing. You
have shown me and created such a terrific example and set such
high standards for me. But most importantly beside from the
professional things you've done for me, I thank you for your
friendship. You have been my best friend over these past four
years and I'll miss working with you every day but I know we'll
see each other a lot."
<P>
<a name="3">
3) Clueless in Chicago. James Warren, Washington Bureau
Chief for the Chicago Tribune appeared on C-SPAN's December 27
Washington Journal, by coincidence the same day The Washington
Times ran MRC Chairman Brent Bozell's column on the Best Notable
Quotables on 1996. MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed the
exchange. 
<BR>
<DD>    
Brian Lamb observed: "Chicago Tribune again is in the news
this morning in Brent Bozell's column. Now if you knew that,
do you know Brent Bozell?"
    James Warren: "I know who he is, yeah."
    Lamb: "Do you know what side of the political fence he 
comes down on?"
    Warren: "Yes."
    Lamb: "What?"
    Warren: "Yes. Very, very, very right of Brian Lamb."    
    Lamb: (Laughter) "Anyway, he has a column in the 
Washington Times and the headline is, 'Quotes of note for 
the past year' and I just want to read you the first 
paragraph. 'On September the 5th the Chicago Tribune issued this 
remarkable correction. Quote, In her Wednesday commentary 
column, Linda Bowles stated that President Clinton and his 
former campaign adviser Dick Morris both were guilty of 
callous unfaithfulness to their wives and children. Neither 
man has admitted to being or been proven to have been 
unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error.' It goes on to 
say, 'Now if that strikes you as just about the dumbest 
quote you ve heard all year, then you would be agreeing with 
the panel of 57 judges who bid adieu to 1996 by selecting 
the Media Research Center's ninth annual Best Notable 
Quotables, noting the years worst reporting.'"
<BR>
<DD>    
Warren then responded, but confused Bozell with Bowles and
missed the whole concept that the quote of interest was the
Tribune correction, not the Bowles column: "If that's the best Mr.
Bowles could come up with, slow year. Linda Bowles is a syndicated
columnist who runs in the Tribune occasionally. That's one I
missed."
<BR>
<DD>
Since that last CyberAlert, the "Best of" quotes were the focus
of a December 29 Ray Archer column in the Arizona Republic, and
the entire editorial space in the December 31 New York Post and
January 1 Manchester (NH) Union Leader. Plus the topic on many
radio talk show hosts.
<P>
<a name="4"> 
4) On the December 28 Capital Gang on CNN Time's Margaret
Carlson asserted "If we didn't have Newt Gingrich having 
brought down Jim Wright on, on, I think, picayune, as picayune as
this, then I think there would be less hostility towards him at
this moment."
<BR>
<DD>   
Andrew Ferguson of The Weekly Standard countered: "Jim Wright
was trying to line his own pockets in the most sordid, squalid
sort of way...."
<BR>
<DD>   
Referring to Gingrich, Carlson shot back: "But he was lining
his own personal power pockets, which is just as bad."
<BR>
<DD>
A bit later Carlson said: "Jim Wright sold books to, you know,
people coming to his speeches and Newt Gingrich took money for
needy children and used it for his college course."
<BR>
<DD>
The next day on Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked U.S. Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT): "Not just maybe from a
technical point of view, but you had the Speaker, somebody who led
the assault on Jim Wright, he never ended up getting prosecuted,
he never broke the law. Doesn't the Speaker's credibility kind of
get diminished by this and doesn't he become a symbol of somebody
who broke the rules as opposed to somebody who followed the rules?
Doesn't this give you a credibility problem?"
<BR>
<DD>
As Robert Novak pointed out last week, the "took money from
needy children" charge is preposterous. To avoid the lengthy
process of creating a foundation to produce a television show,
Gingrich simply took control of a foundation aimed at helping
children, but which was inactive and had no money.
<BR>
<DD>    
Wright may not have gone through the criminal system, but he
resigned when his pocket-lining was revealed. As a December 30
Washington Times editorial explained, "To get around a House limit
on honoraria for speaking engagements, Mr. Wright and a long-time
crony set up a phoney book publishing deal in which Mr. Wright got
an astonishing 55 percent royalty...The Speaker's office then
encouraged organizations to buy the book in bulk as a quid pro quo
for an appearance...The committee found that Mr. Wright improperly
pocketed $54,600 from 1984 to 1987 from this ruse."
<P>
<a name="5"> 
5) As they always do at the end of the year, the Associated
Press surveyed newspaper editors and broadcast news directors to
determine the top 10 stories of the year. Number 6 on the list:
"Welfare Ends." In AP's story on the poll reporter Helen O'Neill
began the welfare item: "Acknowledging that the new law was
'seriously flawed,' President Clinton signed it anyway, ending
welfare as we know it." After summarizing the key changes, O'Neill
provided this less than balanced assessment of its impact: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Supporters said the new law would get people on their feet,
but criticism came from many quarters: from states that said they
couldn't meet the deadlines, from social workers who said the new
system will plunge more people into poverty, from three top
federal officials who resigned in protest. 'I think a lot of
people will start starving,' said Shawn Cornett, a 22-year-old
welfare recipient in Kentucky."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) CBS News can report whatever it wants, but Walter
Cronkite doesn't think the First Amendment should apply to
everyone. Asked in the December 28 TV Guide "What do you think of
the Internet?" Cronkite offered this contradictory response (Read
this all the way through, especially the last sentence):
<BR>
<DD>    
"It's at the moment highly dangerous; I hope that we pacify it
in the near future. A three-page, very slickly done presentation
alleged that I was drunk in an Orlando restaurant and spit in a
man's soup. And no way to trace it whatsoever. It seems to me that
these sources of so called information should have to identify
themselves. There should be a sense of responsibility placed upon
them to stand behind what they report. I just abhor any form of
censorship, but I do not think there's anything wrong at all with
banning anonymous information."
<BR>
<DD>
Hey, we're not all as gullible as Pierre Salinger. 
<P>
<a name="7">
7) In the James Brady "In Step With" interview in Sunday's
(January 5) Parade magazine Brady profiled Today weather reader Al
Roker. Brady related what prompted Roker to lose weight: "Let's
get down to the real news: losing all that weight. 'I'm 5 feet 8
and weight 255 right now, down from 310,' said Al. 'Last February
I was dressing one morning, and my daughter came in and said, 'You
have enormous breasts.' So I went to a gym."

8) Update: The "Apparently To..." problem many of you are
experiencing is caused by a "bug" in CompuServe's new mail
software that we were switched to in mid-December. I have had
conversations with Customer Service about trying to rectify this
inability to blind copy outside of CompuServe, but they are unable
to tell me how soon this will be resolved. In some cases the BC
names are being listed as CC. On the bright side, this is not a
problem with all e-mail software and some services, like AOL, bury
the list so most on AOL have probably never noticed it.
<BR>
<DD>    
Thanks to the over 100 of you who made me aware of the problem
and provided examples which I was able to forward as evidence to
CompuServe Customer Service. For those concerned about the
security of their e-mail address I am sorry and I delayed this
CyberAlert hoping the problem could be resolved. But, keep in mind
that it's the same group of 40 to 50 recipients who are seeing
your address each time, not new names each time or the whole 1,200
name list.

1) At the top of the Time magazine Man of the Year special
that CNN ran Monday night (December 23) at 10pm ET the Time
editors who picked the AIDS researcher explained why some others
were not chosen. As transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski,
our news division Officer in Charge this past week, here's what
Time Deputy Managing Editor James Kelly asserted: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Netanyahu was a possibility because his election was quite a
surprise. He had a lot of people hoping that he would in fact
grow in the job and become a peacemaker and so far that hasn't
happened."
<p>
<DD>
This very week Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has agreed to
follow the peace treaty and turn over another town, Hebron, to
the Palestinians. Meanwhile, as Jeff Jacoby, the Boston Globe's
conservative columnist pointed out December 26, the Palestinian
Authority (PA) continues to violate the Oslo Accords. On December
11 members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
fired into a car and killed a Jewish mother and her 12-year-old
son. Yasir Arafat refuses to let Israel prosecute the gunmen
despite, as Jacoby noted, "the explicit mandate of the Oslo
Accords which...obligates the Palestinian Authority to arrest and
extradite criminal suspects. (Israel has made 27 extradition
requests since the accords were signed. The Palestinian Authority
has denied them all.)"
<p>
<DD>
The accords also demanded that the PLO eliminate from its
charter the plank calling for the extermination of Israel. The
PLO has yet to comply. Sounds like it's Arafat who needs to "grow
in the job and become a peacemaker." 

<P>
<a name="2">
2) Under the headline "Clinton Budget to Offer Tax Relief:
Proposal Would Avoid Trims in Social Security Increases," the
December 25 Boston Globe ran a piece from Martin Crutsinger of
the Associated Press. In the eighth paragraph the AP Washington
bureau staffer wrote:
<BR>
<DD>    
"The President has called a balanced budget the top priority
of his second term. An attempt to accomplish that feat last
winter ended in bitter deadlock with the Republican-controlled
Congress."
<p>
<DD>
Gee, now that's why Clinton refused to sign the budget
resolutions. He wanted to balance the budget and those nasty
Republicans wouldn't let him.   

<P>
<a name="3">
3) In the December 23 Time magazine President Bruce Hallett
reported in his To Our Readers box: "Last month the New York
Association of Black Journalists honored us with four awards."
Among the winners: "National correspondent Jack E. White for the
second consecutive year received two prizes: one for 'overall
excellence in writing and reporting,' the other for his column,
Dividing Line."
<BR>
<DD>    
Hallett quoted White's reaction: "The goal in my column and
in other stories is to examine and expose some of the nonsense
that Americans continue to believe about race. Generally, whites
tend to downplay the extent of their racism -- and blacks tend to
overplay it. We could use a lot more openness and honesty."
<p>
<DD>
Well, let's go the Best Notable Quotables of 1996: The Ninth
Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting and see for what quote
White won the Timothy McVeigh Award (for blaming conservatives 
for violence).
<BR>
<DD>    
"The torching of black churches throughout the South
punctuates the ugly rhetoric of the Buchanan campaign....In fact,
all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative
action, more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern
and Border states have been torched....there is already enough
evidence to indict the cynical conservatives who build their
political careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of
race-baiting. They may not start fires, but they fan the flames."
<BR>
-- Time national correspondent Jack E. White, March 18 issue.
<p>
<DD>
White should know a lot about "nonsense."

4) From the December 26 Late Show with David Letterman, the 
"Top Ten Things Overheard at the White House on Christmas Day."

5) By my count Bryant Gumbel has co-hosted Today just seven
mornings in December, but I assume he'll be back most of the
December 30-January 3 week, his last. USA Today "Inside TV"
columnist Peter Johnson reported December 23 that CBS and ABC and
are fighting to land Gumbel: "ABC News is considered the front-runner, 
but ABC News chief Roone Arledge says not to count out NBC, which he 
predicts will make 'a major move to keep him.' Gumbel 'is terrific. 
Anybody would love to have him.'" Anybody, that is, interested in 
promoting liberals and denigrating conservatives.
<p>
<DD>
Below is the December 30 edition of Notable Quotables, the
MRC's bi-weekly compilation of the latest outrageous, sometimes
humorous, quotes in the liberal media. This week: A special good-bye 
salute to Bryant Gumbel, our bountiful Babylon of biased bombast. 
<P>
<center><i>December 30, 1996 (Vol. Nine; No. 27)</i></center>
<P>
<center><b>BYE-BYE BRYANT:</b> Gumbel's Years of Liberal Advocacy</center>
<P>
<b>Editor's Note:</b> January 3 will be Bryant Gumbel's last day after
15 years as co-host of NBC's Today. Here are highlights from 1989
through 1996. 
<p>
<center>1989</center>
<p>
"Blacks have looked at the past eight years and seen this
administration retreat from civil rights, retreat from
affirmative action, make South Africa no priority, continue to
see a greater disparity economically between blacks and whites,
foster a spirit of racism that hasn't been seen in 20-plus
years."<br> 
-- To Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, January 19
Today.
<P>
"Largely as a result of the policies and priorities of the Reagan
administration, more people are becoming poor and staying poor in
this country than at any time since World War II."<br>
-- July 17 Today.
<p>
"This test is not going to tell you whether you're a racist or a
liberal."<br>
-- Previewing his prime-time special The Racial Attitudes and Consciousness Exam, 
 September 5 Today.
<p>
<center>1990</center>
<p>
"It is certain the President won't mention the T word, and yet
taxes are very much at the heart of what all our potential
solutions are. How long can both sides pretend that a hike's not
needed?"<br>
-- January 31.
<P>
"The missteps, poor efforts, and setbacks brought on by the
Reagan years have made this a more sober Earth Day. The task
seems larger now." <br>
-- April 20 Today.
<p>
"The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed....It's
a Wednesday morning, a day when the budget picture, frankly,
seems gloomier than ever. It now seems the time has come to pay
the fiddler for our costly dance of the Reagan years."<br> 
-- Gumbel leading off Today, May 9.
<p>
<center>1991</center>
<p>
"Tonight the NBC News program Expos, looks at incidence of sexual
harassment in [federal low-income] housing....Well, I guess
that's where the problem began. Actually, it was when the budget
was taken out of the affordable housing market during the Reagan
years and thus, the problem came about."<br> 
-- To reporter Michele Gillen, September 20 Today.
<p>
Reporter Lea Thompson: "...So you can't depend on government
police to do this for you. We did find this flammable sleepwear
everywhere we went."
<br>
Gumbel: "Lea, Lea, real quick. Why is the government abdicating
its responsibility on this? Is this another holdover from the
Reagan years and the cutbacks?"
<br>
Thompson: "Absolutely. And somebody's gotta do something."<br> 
--Exchange on Today, November 13.
<p>
<center>1992</center>
<br>
"The boom years following World War II saw the economy take off,
giving rise to the growth of the great American middle class. The
rising standard of living meant homes, cars, TVS, college for the
kids -- all in all, a piece of the American dream. But in the
Reagan years, economic erosion set in, so much so that the middle
class now finds itself in ever-deepening trouble."<br> 
-- January 22 Today.
<P>
"We keep looking for some good to come out of this. Maybe it
might help in putting race relations on the front burner after
they've been subjugated so long as a result of the Reagan years."
<br>
-- On the Los Angeles riots, April 30, 1992 Today (Gumbel refused
to condemn the rioters).
<p>
<center>1993</center> 
<p>
"It's early yet, but for at least trying to address the deficit
in a more serious fashion than anyone in 12 years, what kind of
early marks do you give Bill Clinton?"<br> 
-- To author Gerald Swanson, March 17 Today.
<p>
"In the greedy excesses of the Reagan years, the mean income of
the average physician nearly doubled, from $88,000 to $170,000.
Was that warranted?"<br> 
-- To the AMA's Richard Corlin, March 31 Today.
<p>
"If I'm a young black man in South Central L.A., where poverty is
rampant and unemployment is skyrocketing, I see that Washington's
promises of a year ago have gone unfulfilled, I see that perhaps
for a second time, the court's inability to mete out justice in a
blind fashion, why shouldn't I vent my anger?"<br> 
-- To U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), April 15 Today.
<P>
<center>1994</center>
<P>
"It's been written that being black in America is like being a
witness at your own lynching. Why didn't your experience make you
more resentful than you are today?"<br> 
-- To criminal-turned-Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, March 22 Today.
<P>
"We've got an awful lot to talk about this week, including the
sexual harassment suit against the President. Of course, in that
one, it's a little tough to figure out who's really being
harassed." <br>
-- Today, May 10.
<P>
"You're aligned to a party which owes many of its victories to
the so-called religious right and other conservative extremists
who are historically insensitive to minority concerns. That
doesn't bother you?"<br> 
-- To U.S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), November 9 Today.
<P>
<center>1995</center>
<p>
"You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, 'trickle-down
terrorists who base their agenda on division, exclusion, and
fear.' Do you think middle class Americans are in need of
protection from that group?" <br>
-- To about-to-be House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, January 4 Today.
<p>
"Janet Reno has asked for an independent counsel to investigate
charges against HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros. Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown is being investigated. Questions have been raised about
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. Agriculture Secretary
Mike Espy resigned under pressure, as did Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders. The Clinton White House seems to be having a
hard time retaining high-profile minorities particularly. Do you
think, Senator, they are being held to a higher standard in
Washington than their white predecessors?"<br> 
-- To Senator Ted Kennedy, March 15 Today.
<p>
"This comes at a time when Republicans are looking to gut the
Clean Water Act and also the Safe Drinking Water Act. What are
our options? Are we now forced to boil water because bottled
water is not an economically feasible option for a lot of
people?" <br>
-- To Natural Resources Defense Council lawyer Erik Olson, June 1 Today.
<P>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is
still being treated as if he were guilty."<br> 
-- October 16 Today.
<p>
<center>1996</center>
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused enormous
suffering for those who were least able to afford it."<br>

serious." But, again, it's hardly big news on NBC.

<li><a href="#6"> Eleanor Clift announced her year-end awards.</a> She bashed Dornan

</ol>
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) To set up today's first item we need to review a comment
from Tim Russert and media coverage from late October. On October
25 a panel of judges authorized independent counsel Kenneth Starr
to investigate whether former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum
lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's involvement in the
FBI files matter.
<br>
<dd>    
On the October 28 Today, NBC's Tim Russert insisted: "This is 
dead serious. I mean the ethical problems of the Clinton Administration 
are now troubling even to the most partisan Democrats."
<br>
<dd>        
So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? The CBS Evening News didn't mention the news. On
ABC's World News Tonight anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item.
And how did Russert's NBC, where he is Washington Bureau Chief,
treat a story that he insists can't be dismissed nine days before
election day? NBC Nightly News offered viewers only a brief item
read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<p>
<dd>    
Now, fast forward to the Friday Today show of December 20.
Katie Couric interviewed Russert at about 7:20am. After asking
about Newt Gingrich she turned to the President and the decision
of Justice Department officials to probe Clinton's defense fund. 
<br>
<dd>        
Russert explained:
<br>
<dd>        
"Career officials in the public integrity section. Yesterday,
another bombshell. They we're not only going to look into
President Clinton re-election campaign fundraising, they're going to
look into fundraising for his legal defense fund. And they
subpoenaed documents throughout Washington. This is deadly
serious, Katie. It is career, professional investigators in the
Justice Department who are going to prove their independence. And
this investigation into the President's campaign and legal
campaign fund is going to be exhaustive and people at the White
House are quite concerned this morning."
<p>
<dd>    
Well they needn't worry about TV network coverage. The 7am
Today newscast didn't mention this development nor the front page
Washington Post story that day which revealed how Clinton had
included in a fundraising gathering the head of the Chinese arms
manufacturer accused of smuggling weapons into the U.S. But Today
dedicated three minutes to two stories on OJ. In fact, the defense
fund subpoena development was overshadowed by the Newt Gingrich
case. Here's a network evening show breakdown:
<p>
<dd>    
ABC's World News Tonight: On December 19 ABC ignored the
defense fund subpoenas, but did find time for a brief item on the
status of Newt Gingrich. On December 20: nothing.
<br>
<dd>        
CBS Evening News: On December 19 CBS aired a full Phil Jones
story on Gingrich followed by a brief mention from anchor John
Roberts about Clinton. On December 20 CBS was the only one of the
three networks to air a full story on the Chinese arms dealer.
<br>
<dd>    
NBC Nightly News: On December 19 NBC's Tom Brokaw relayed a
short item on Clinton followed by a full story on Gingrich from
reporter Lisa Myers. On December 20 anchor Brian Williams showed a
clip of Clinton commenting on the Chinese arms dealer during his
press conference that day after announcing the latest cabinet
picks. But no full story on NBC on either development.
<P>
<a name="2">
2) On the same theme (of what's big news on Sunday morning
isn't always reported on network newscasts), on the December 22
This Week George Will recalled the December 15 Washington Post
story on how Clinton is "treating the Lincoln Bedroom as Motel 6."
Cokie Roberts chimed in: "It's offensive. It's offensive to
anybody. I mean nobody can look at that and not be appalled."
<p>
<dd>    
Nobody apparently except producers for ABC's World News
Tonight, which failed to report the revelation of how large
contributors get a night in the White House. 
<P>
<a name="3">
3) The December 9 CyberAlert reported how in his first piece
for the New Republic William Powers, a former Washington Post
reporter, showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton
character issue during the campaign. Other reporters have not
appreciated his analysis. Powers and Newsweek's Jonathan Alter
are exchanging a series of memos on the Slate magazine Web
site (www.slate.com). 
<br>
<dd>        
In his December 11 shot Alter called the Powers piece
"ridiculous," contending Clinton's ethics got plenty of coverage.
On December 13 Powers responded: "I am sincerely stunned, and more
than a little intrigued, by the way you and other media watchers
have reacted to my debut New Republic piece. I seem to have broken
some secret, unspoken rule of the club. Your collective tone is of
incredulous disdain, as in: 'Whooooaa, what's up with this new guy?
He's got some ridiculous idea that the coverage of the Clinton
scandals was inadequate. Can you imagine? Must be some raving
right-winger. Is he insane?'"
<p>
<dd>    
Well, welcome to the club Mr. Powers.
<p>
<dd>    
In his December 17 retort, Alter dismissed Powers's series of
examples of under coverage: "As for Filegate, do you honestly
believe that Newsweek, or any other news organization, wouldn't
have loved a good, juicy Craig Livingstone story to liven up
October? Of course we would have. But what are we supposed to do -- 
make one up?"
<p>
<dd>    
Alter should read MediaWatch. As we reported in our October
Study, the networks largely ignored Filegate. On September 25
Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a six month gap in the log which
listed who at the White House accessed the FBI background files.
CNN's World Today did a story and it got one mention on ABC's Good
Morning America. But zilch on CBS and NBC as well as World News
Tonight.
<br>
<dd>        
On October 4 the Senate released the deposition of Mari
Anderson, a former aide to Livingstone. She verified that pages
were missing and that, in contradiction to Livingstone's testimony,
he knew they were getting files on Republicans. The Washington
Post put it on page one, but nothing appeared in the morning or
evening on ABC, CBS or NBC. CNN did note it on The World Today.
<P>
<a name="4">
4) Here's Number 7 from the December 23 Time magazine "Worst
Public Performances of 1996."
<br>
<dd>        
"Robert Dornan. B-1 Bob went ballistic after narrowly losing
his House seat in Orange County, California, to Hispanic financial
analyst Loretta Sanchez. Threatening to sue her for election
fraud, Dornan called Sanchez a 'liar' and said  the whole thing
stinks to high heaven.' Of course, sour grapes were to be expected
from the former fighter pilot who once grabbed a fellow
Congressman by the collar and called him a 'draft-dodging wimp.'
Sanchez's campaign manager, John Sullivan, spoke for many when he
said of Dornan, 'He's been, and continues to be, a national
disgrace. All we can say is Adios.' The bad news is that Dornan
will now have more time for his second job as Rush Limbaugh's
substitute host."
<P>
<a name="5">
5) A question listed in "Walter Scott's Personality Parade"
in the December 15 Parade, the Sunday newspaper magazine, asked
"if the federal budget was ever in the black?" The Parade writer 
explained that Louis Fisher, a political scientist with the Library 
of Congress, reported that there's been a surplus in 27 budgets this 
century. "The other years showed deficits, but most were manageable 
until 1981, when 'President Reagan's plan to increase defense 
spending while cutting taxes threw the deficit into the $200 billion 
range,' says Fisher."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) On this past weekend's McLaughlin Group Newsweek's
Eleanor Clift showed that the gap between the official White House
line and what she mouths is near impossible to quantify. The Group
issued its year-end assessments. Here are a few from Clift:
<p>
-- Biggest Winner: "Linda Sanchez who toppled Bob Dornan, the
scourge of all thinking people. And also awakened us to the power
of the Hispanic vote, even in Republican stronghold Orange
County."
<br>    
-- Most Decisive Campaign Moment: "Sadly, the flap over the
Indonesian campaign contributions. The only thing that moved the
polls all year. Probably cost the Democrats control of he House."
<br>    
-- Turncoat of the Year: "Sherrie Rowlands, the lady of the
night who ratted on Dick Morris and tarnished what would otherwise

That's not quite the line many liberals in the media took when
President Bush tapped Clarence Thomas.

<LI><a href="#dole">On Tuesday Bob Dole</a> called Clinton a tax and spend liberal. Covering Dole's speech, CBS asserts that the "ex-deficit hawk" must "do more than criticize." NBC says Dole's latest themes reflect a "campaign of fear."

<a name="dole">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Before the Economic Club of Detroit</FONT> on Tuesday Bob Dole
said Bill Clinton is a liberal bent on raising taxes. ABC's World
News Tonight on Tuesday (September 24) didn't mention the speech. 
<P>
On the CBS Evening News, Phil Jones charged that supporting a
tax cut means Dole is no longer concerned about the deficit.
Jones also worried that criticizing Clinton isn't the right
strategy. 
<P>
<DD>Jones reported: "The former Senator argued that voters have a
choice between two different visions of government."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He wants families to pinch their pennies so government can
spend more money. I've got a new idea. I want the government for
a change to pinch its pennies so the families will not have to
pinch theirs."
<BR><DD>Jones: "The ex-deficit hawk returned to the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>Dole: "I know the critics say you can't do this, you can't cut
taxes and balance the budget. What they're really saying is that
they cannot do it."
<BR><DD>Jones: "Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing
President Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason
for this attack. But between now and election day the Republican
nominee has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole
plan."
<P>
After showing some of the same tax soundbites from Dole, on
NBC Nightly News David Bloom ran a clip of a new Clinton ad which
criticizes Dole's Senate record, emphasizing Dole's length of
service. Bloom then charged:
<BR><DD>"So now Dole who's complained about Clinton's campaign of fear is
taking a similar tack."
<BR><DD>Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to the
White House."
<BR><DD>Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame. David Bloom, NBC News, Detroit."
<P>
<a name="hillary">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) "FDIC Report Says Mrs. Clinton's Work Was Used to
Deceive,"</FONT> declared the front page Washington Post headline on
Tuesday. The news was also played above the fold in The
Washington Times. But neither the Monday or Tuesday night ABC,
CBS or NBC evening shows mentioned the development. 
<P>
Post reporter Susan Schmidt's lead: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
drafted a real estate document that was used by an Arkansas S&L
to 'deceive' federal regulators in 1996 and pay more than $300,000
in questioned commissions to one of her law firm's well-connected
clients, a federal inspector general concluded yesterday. The
strongly worded report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
inspector general found evidence that Clinton and her former law
partner Webster Hubbell were involved in dealings on behalf of
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan that they have told federal
investigators under oath they cannot recall."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) An expert media observer</FONT> who had up close, insider
access to how the media covered Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election
campaign says reporters are going a lot easier on Clinton this
year. The expert: Sam Donaldson. With Brit Hume out ill last
week, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the first time
since Reagan's years. And things have changed, USA Today's Peter
Johnson reported Monday (September 23):
<BR><DD>"Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the
one that fueled their cries of 'Mr. President! Mr. President!'
during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson
isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on. Except
for CBS' Rita Braver, 'I have heard no reporter trying to ask the
President any question,' Donaldson said Friday....
<BR><DD>"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? 'You're not
going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,'
said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989.
'But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude
toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter agrees. In his "Politics" column on
Monday, Richard Benedetto wrote:
<BR><DD>"As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through
six states in four days last week, it did so virtually unimpeded
by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now
and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good
speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired
impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll....
<BR><DD>"In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept
President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would
rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive
with Clinton."
<P>We're bringing them to our side, one reporter at a time.

<LI> <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a> is losing. What's to blame? The fact that he's failed
to nail down his conservative base? No, ABC says -- surprise,
surprise -- that he's moved "too far to the right."

<li> <a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> urges prayer for children because of the welfare

<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="dole"></a>
<h3>1) </h3><dd>It could be argued that Bob Dole is losing because he
lacks conservative passion, that conservatives don't trust that
he'll follow through on his conservative promises. But that's not
a view ABC took Monday night. On the September 23 World News
Tonight reporter Dean Reynolds explored why Dole is behind in
Michigan's 8th congressional district, the Lansing area. In 1992
the networks didn't blame conservatives for Bush's impending loss
until October. This year ABC made an early start.
<dd>
    Reynolds found people happy with the economy and cynical
about the political process. Reynolds explained: "The same
cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton, seems to work
directly against Bob Dole with many voters here calling his 15
percent tax cut idea a political gimmick."
<dd>
    Following a soundbite from a teacher who asserted that you
can't cut taxes without increasing the deficit and who then
denounced Newt Gingrich, Reynolds relayed: "Many of the voters we
spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government shut down,
for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for attempts to trim
Medicare specifically."
<dd>
    Reynolds then aired a soundbite from Ron Bell, a man on golf
course: "I think that anybody that came out as strong as Mr.
Gingrich did when he first came out regarding Medicare was
committing political suicide and I think the Republican Party
took too long before they tried to quiet him down."
<dd>Reynolds: "And Ron Bell is a life-long Republican."
<dd>    Interviewer, off camera: "Your party. Did it move too far to
the right?"
<dd>    Bell: "Yes, far too far to the right."
<dd>    Reynolds: "That may explain why Dole is having trouble
winning over women voters."
<dd>    Woman in restaurant: "I am a Republican and I'm having some
troubles with the platform because I'm pro-choice."
<dd>    2nd woman in restaurant: "I think abortion is not a political
issue. It has no business in politics."
<dd>    Reynolds: "And where there is support for Dole, it often
sounds lukewarm."
<dd>    3rd woman in restaurant: "I will support Dole and most
probably vote for him, but it would have been nice if we had a
different candidate.
<dd>
    Reynolds concluded his story: "Across Michigan's 8th
district, from the city streets to the fields of corn, the Dole
campaign is struggling, trailing and has six weeks to catch up."
<dd>
    So busy portraying Dole as "too far to the right," Reynolds
failed to consider that maybe voters don't believe his tax cut
promise because Dole has a long record of raising taxes over
conservative objections. Reynolds also failed to look at how
Reagan and Bush managed to win with a pro-life message.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="reporter"></a>
<h3>2) </h3><dd>Monday's Washington Post "Reliable Source" column
revealed that "Former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers,
35, and New York Times White House reporter Todd Purdum, 36, are
engaged after dating seriously for about a year." Myers is now
the liberal co-host of CNBC's Equal Time.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="gumbel"></a>
<h3>3) </h3><dd>The Children Defense Fund's Marian Wright Edelman
appeared on Monday's Today show (September 23) to promote the
paperback release of her book titled Guide My Feet. It's a collection
of "prayers and meditations for children."
<dd>
    Bryant Gumbel asked her: "In light of the new welfare reform
bill, do you think the children need more prayers than ever
before?"
<dd>
    Yes, that when they grow up they won't have to watch biased
morning show hosts like Bryant Gumbel. -- Brent Baker

<H3> 1)</H3><DD>Ronald Reagan left office more than seven years ago,
but he's still fodder for liberal TV script writers. At the
beginning of Wednesday night's Rockford Files movie special on
CBS, "Jim Rockford" (a private investigator played by James
Garner, for those of you who missed the 1970s), arrives at a
birthday party for the father of a former girlfriend he hasn't
seen for 15 years. 
<DD>
Upon seeing Rockford, the father says to him: "I was glad to
hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I bet the Reagan years
were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor
fraud."
<DD>
Rockford responded: "Matter of fact."
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="Dole"> </a>
<H3>2)</H3><DD>A few hours earlier Wednesday night (September 18) Dan
Rather opened the CBS Evening News: "Bob Dole unloads his
strongest attack yet blaming President Clinton personally and
directly for rising drug crime."
<DD>
He then began the show with this assessment of the themes of
each candidate that put Clinton in a more positive light: 
<DD>
"Bob Dole and Bill Clinton targeted each other today, on
each other's turf. In California Dole gave star billing to
President Clinton in a new attack blaming both the President and
Hollywood for what he says is a lax attitude on drug abuse.
President Clinton's theme today was let's protect the
environment, parks and public lands together. He used the Grand
Canyon as his backdrop to declare almost two million acres of
Utah off limits to developers."
<DD>
Reporter Phil Jones reported on Dole and included some doubt
about the effectiveness of Dole's anti-drug slogan and concluded
by noting that "only eleven percent blame the Clinton
administration for the [drug] problem." Rita Braver then
reported on Clinton move "to stake his claim as the
environmental President." But Braver didn't include any
consideration of how Clinton's move was an anti-property rights
land grab. ABC and NBC at least aired soundbites from upset Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, but CBS aired no dissenting voice. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="CIA"></a>
<H3>3)</H3><DD>Thursday night's (September 19) InterNight on MSNBC
looked at the San Jose Mercury News story that the CIA 
coordinated cocaine sales in Los Angeles in the 1980s through a
Nicaraguan to pay for the Contras. The guests: the reporter
(Gary Webb), Jesse Jackson, a lawyer for a drug dealer,
Washington talk show host Joe Madison and his buddy, the wacky
as always Dick Gregory. The premise of course is that if the CIA
hadn't provided the drugs the residents of South Central would
not have become addicted to crack.
<DD>Here are a few of host Ed Gordon's less than probing
questions:
<DD>
    -- To Jesse Jackson: "Does it bother you that indeed, and I
think this is where you're going, the hypocrisy that might be
that those who backed the Contras at that time and said it was
for freedom fighters and the like would indeed turn their back
on this country's problems?"
<DD>
    -- To Dick Gregory: "Dick, I know that this is nothing new
to you in the sense of trying to keep people alert to what may
be going on across this country as relates to the government,
but as you compare it to things you've seen and heard in the
past where does this fall?"
<DD>
    -- To Joe Madison: "As Dick was saying, a conspiratorial
thing, something that is genocidal that many African-Americans
whisper and talk about that, or was it simply an economic
situation that they thought this was a quick way to make money
to send to the Contras?"
<BR>

<a name="Free"></a>
<H3>4)</H3><DD>Study, from the front page of the September MediaNomics 
published by the MRC's Free Market Project:
<DD><B>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Do Not Deficit Chicken Hawks</B>
<DD>"At the Republican convention, Bob Dole pledged to cut income
taxes by 15 percent, balance the budget, and leave Social
Security and Medicare untouched. Tough-minded reporters believed
none of it and shared their skepticism with a national
television audience," writes the Weekly Standard's David Frum in
the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<DD>But then, according to Frum, "Two weeks later, the Democrats met
in convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth
about their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al
Gore's words, of wanting to `give health insurance rip-off
artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for
our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace
Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.' Those remarks are
blatantly untrue, both about the Republican plans and about
Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing."
<DD>Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax
rhetoric than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media
Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about
either tax cuts or Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World Today during the
month of August. The MRC's findings: While network journalists
were ardent deficit hawks when reporting on tax cuts, they lost
their deficit-cutting zeal when Democrats denounced Republican
Medicare plans.
<DD>There were a total of 24 stories during the month that
questioned whether Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the
budget. Only two stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could
erase the deficit while not advancing Medicare reforms in his
second term.
<DD>The reaction to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same
across the networks. "Since Dole would leave Social Security,
Medicare, and defense untouched," reported CBS News
correspondent Phil Jones, "it's still unclear what would be cut
in order to pay for his tax cut." According to CNN's Gene
Randall, "Bob Dole has produced an economic plan that is getting
mixed reviews even from Republicans. The bipartisan Concord
Coalition on Sunday warned against election-year tax-cut
Santas."
<DD>NBC's Mike Jensen offered that "most analysts say it's not good
economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth of the tax cuts would be
paid for by an expanding economy, but the rest would have to
come from spending cuts, and those haven't been spelled out
yet." Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran claimed that "if
critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to budget deficits of the
size of those dating back to the Reagan era, then his campaign
simply isn't going to worry about it for now."
<DD>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics columnist
Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post, pointed
out that in the upcoming years "the only way to avoid (or
minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced
benefits and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On
Medicare, the Republicans proposed precisely such a
shift...Clinton's demolition of this effort confounds the CBO's
sensible advice."
<DD>
Only two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare
alone could be compatible with balanced budgets. "A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade," ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. "So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit
reductions will be impossible to sustain." ABC's Jeff Greenfield
reported that "with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in
about 15 years, those entitlement programs could take every
single dollar of the budget."
<DD>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters concerned about how
to "pay for" automatic Medicare spending increases. If Bill
Clinton won't reform Medicare in his next term, why aren't
reporters asking him which taxes he will raise?

<i>"They listened to those reports of the people turning down the
dials when negative responses were made in San Diego. He did it
on the high road. He said this was to be a campaign of ideas, not
insults, no personal attacks. And I think a final thought, Dan.
This was a convention that was well-planned and well-thought out.
They had their themes and they hit the mark every day. And the
President hit the mark tonight."<p>
 -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley,
after Clinton's speech.</i><p>

<h2><a name="nasty">"Nasty</a> Little Scandal" Prompts Some New Clinton Scrutiny;
 Dick Morris Story Mars Pro-Clinton Euphoria<p></h2></center>

    The networks generally praised Bill Clinton's acceptance
speech last night, but earlier in the evening coverage
concentrated on the resignation of Clinton campaign strategist
Dick Morris after revelations of a relationship with a
prostitute. The Morris news forced some networks to discuss
issues suppressed the first three nights: Clinton's character and
whether Morris pushed him artificially to the right.<p>

    "Two of the best and brightest of their political generation,
both baby boomers," marveled Tom Brokaw of Clinton and Gore.
ABC's Sam Donaldson offered: "Clinton always gives a great
speech, and this was another one of them. But the record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind." <p>

    -- CBS and NBC evening shows led with Morris, but ABC's Peter
Jennings seemed annoyed that he had to even mention the
allegations. "Here in Chicago," Jennings began World News
Tonight, "the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the
speech he will be giving to this convention and to the country
tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very upbeat
convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll
numbers to accompany it. And a very important set of statistics
about the economy today, which he will certainly point to as
evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along
comes a nasty little scandal to take the edge off the good news
at least for one day." <p>

    -- Questions about liberal influences on Clinton. Tom Brokaw,
on NBC Nightly News, asked Tim Russert "Does this open the door
then...to some of the President's old friends, who are more left
of center than right of center?" Dan Rather to Ted Kennedy in
prime time: "Bob Dole said today with Morris gone President
Clinton has only around him now liberal aides, and that's going
to hurt him?"<p>

    --  Character issue raised on CNN and NBC, which were the
only networks to detail the Morris story. On the 7pm ET Inside
Politics, Judy Woodruff inquired of Vernon Jordan: "Does it say
anything about the President's judgment that he would turn again
and again over 20 years to a man like Dick Morris with the sort
of personal problems that he allegedly has?" As prime time began,
only CNN's Bernie Kalb and NBC's Lisa Myers noted the Star
reported Morris used a Clinton campaign hotel room and that he
allowed the woman to listen in on phone calls with Clinton.<p>

    -- The rank hypocrisy of Al Gore's speech Wednesday night
went unmentioned Thursday morning and evening. Gore said his
sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco
crusade, but in 1988 he boasted of growing and selling tobacco.
The only exception came on CNN's Crossfire which showed the 1988
clip of Gore.<p>

<center><h2><a name="ted">The</a> Orator of "Robert Bork's America" Goes Negative Again 
Ted Kennedy's Hit Speech Goes Uncriticized</center></h2><p>

    Reporters continued to miss the hypocrisy of Clinton's
proclamation of an "ideas, not insults" campaign when matched
with the attack-dog rhetoric of podium speakers. Last night, Ted
Kennedy used the exact same literary device that two weeks ago
fueled media criticism of Republican Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison. <p>

    Said Kennedy of the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish
list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing,
Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating,
gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting....minimum
wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations
in San Diego" <p>

    -- NBC's Lisa Myers asked Hutchison in San Diego: "Do you
think you went too far?" On PBS, Tom Brokaw said last night:
"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in full voice after all these
years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the
liberal cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he
does every four years."<p>

    -- On CNN,Bernard Shaw asserted: "Sixteen years ago in New
York's Madison Square Garden, Sen. Edward Kennedy rallied the
Democratic Party. Tonight, he has done it again in Chicago." Ken
Bode added: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the
other party. You get it at any convention. Ted Kennedy does it as
well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."<p>

   -- CNN's Bill Schneider found code words: "What they're trying
to do is take advantage of Dole's age and portray him as sort of
out of it. He's kind of irrelevant. He's kind of a dupe. That the
ideas are the sinister ideas of Newt Gingrich, and even Jack Kemp
with his supply-side ideas." But that attack theme drew no
criticism.<p>

    -- Later, CNN's Judy Woodruff interviewed Kennedy: "Do you
really believe that the Republicans are as dangerous, that Bob
Dole is as dangerous, as you described in your remarks?" Bernard
Shaw queried: "You had a who's who of names tonight: Pat
Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed,
Pat Robertson. What were you driving at?"<p>

    -- On CBS, where Bob Schieffer asked Sen. Hutchison in San
Diego how she felt being "Attack Dog Hutchison," Dan Rather
interviewed Kennedy last night but failed to ask him about the
speech or its tone.<p>


<center><h2><a name="convention">Convention</a>-Inspired Ratherisms</center></h2><p>

    Special events often inspire the folksy aphorisms known as
Ratherisms: <p>

    This is your classic case of two pounds of politics in a
one-pound bag. This hall is only a third the size of the Houston
Astrodome, where the last Republican convention was held." -- 
Dan Rather, leading off Republican coverage, August 12.<p>

    -- "She's expected to hit President Clinton rhetorically with
everything short of a tire tube." -- Rather on Kay Bailey
Hutchison, August 13 convention coverage.<p>

    -- "It looks like California's Governor Pete Wilson is out of
the doghouse. You know from his view he's been put so far back in
the doghouse they had to FedEx him daylight." -- Rather during
August 14 Republican convention coverage. <p>

    -- "The Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee, age 48, is about to give an address in which he is
widely expected to hit Republicans with everything short of a
window weight." -- During August 28 Democratic convention.<p>

    -- "The consensus in the hall is that Albert Gore has scored
with what Harry Caray, the famous Chicago baseball announcer,
might call a home run ball." -- Rather during CBS Democratic
convention coverage, August 28. <p>

<h3>Dick Morris, Family Man</h3>

    Just a day before the Dick Morris prostitute story broke, USA
Today ran a profile. Susan Page's front page piece Wednesday
included this line: "He is a small man and a dapper dresser,
openly devoted to his no-nonsense wife."<p>


<h3>Moderate Liberalism</h3><p>

    Wednesday's New York Times insisted the Democratic Party
defined centrism, but the story listed some very liberal views.
The Democratic "platform takes a middle ground between the
unfettered capitalism and government-enforced morality es- poused
by Republicans and the welfare-state economics and Aquarian
values that once formed Democrats' image," reported David
Rosenbaum.<p>

    Four paragraphs later Rosenbaum summarized the "middle
ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a
strong commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco
regulations, a continuation of affirmative action programs and a
greater emphasis on environmental protection than on the
development of resources."<p>


<h3>Welfare Worries</h3><p>

    Clinton's promise to "fix" welfare reform didn't prompt
questions about his backing down on a promise. Instead, reporters
pressed from the left. On CBS last night Ed Bradley cornered U.S.
Rep. Ron Dellums: "I know you saw it not as welfare reform but
more as a budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" And,
"The President is expected to say tonight that he's going to
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is
that enough?"<p>

<i>"But with these guys coming [Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo], it
was kind of like your young love coming back and oh, I remember
when I was, you know, young and in love with this guy who was
totally unacceptable, and I did the right thing by marrying the

<center><h2><a name="ignoring">Networks Forget 1988 Tobacco-Growing Boast 
Ignoring Al Gore's Inaccuracy, Nastiness</a></h2></center><p>

    The networks delivered praise for Al Gore's speech last
night, ignoring his factual inaccuracies and failing to note how
he had boasted of growing tobacco as recently as 1988, four years
after the death of his sister from lung cancer. After Gore's
talk, in which he explained that his sister's death motivated his
anti-tobacco views, the networks did talk to tobacco-state
delegates. NBC's David Bloom spoke to a Tennessee delegate who
"does not agree with this demonization of this industry."<p>

    "Well, Dan, in a word it was a barnburner," gushed Bob
Schieffer on CBS last night. Though Gore said Republicans wish to
allow "more poison in our air and drinking water," Schieffer
didn't find him nasty: "This was an old-fashioned poli- tical
speech, the kind of speech that politicians used to give before
politics turned so nasty with all those commercials on
television." Though Peter Jennings noted the "attack dog" role of
a VP, no one  mentioned how Gore falsely accused the GOP of
"cutting" Medicare, of wanting it to "wither on the vine," or his
claim of 100,000 new cops on the street. Last Sunday
Scripps-Howard pegged the number at 12,000.<p>

    The New York Times reported July 3 that in 1988, Al Gore told
an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of my life, I
raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of
my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed
it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've
shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and
sold it." No network mentioned this boast, but ABC, NBC and CNN
did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco companies are
here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the Democratic
Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco
roots were highlighted.<p>

    -- Clinton's week of new spending promises hasn't generated
a flurry of questions about how his plans will be paid for, but
Dole's tax cut plan led to concern in San Diego about its impact
on the deficit. One exception: Early in prime time last night
CNN's Charles Bierbauer reviewed Clinton's spending plans and
noted "Republicans say that is the road back to big government."<p>

    -- In stark contrast to San Diego, the networks failed to
describe Tuesday speeches as harsh or mean attacks. The morning
shows didn't raise the idea in interviews with Democratic guests.<p>


    -- The power of unions within the Democratic Party finally
gets highlighted as ABC's World News Tonight and CNN in prime
time examine their role. See page 3. But for CBS the problem
isn't union influence moving the party left, but how President
Clinton is too conservative for the rank and file. <p>

<center><h2><a name="no">More Raves for Jackson & Cuomo, Citations of GOP "Sniping"
No Snarling Partisan Negativity in Chicago?</p></center></h2></a>

    Wednesday marked Day Two of ignoring negativity from the
podium in Chicago:<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings argued: "There
was a rather personal attack on President Clinton by Mr. Dole."
In the ABC clip, Dole said: "Tonight they'll bash Republicans.
Tomorrow night the President will sound to everybody 'If you're
for it, I'm for it. If Bob Dole's for it, I'm for it. If Jesse
Helms is for it, I'm for it. Whoever is for it, I'm for it, and
that's why you should re-elect me, because I don't have any
philosophy, I don't have any beliefs, I don't have any
commitments." Sounds a lot like network complaints about welfare
reform.<p>

    Jim Wooten raved over Jackson and Cuomo: "For a quick moment,
deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a
glimpse of conventions past, when liberals were still the lions
of the party and rhetoric roared....And the delegates, most of
them much more liberal than their convention projects of their
party, celebrated this little touch of yesterday." Wooten said
Hillary "answered Republican sniping at her book on raising
children."<p>

    -- CBS Evening News correspondent Bob Schieffer echoed
Wooten: "During the Republican convention, the Doles disparaged
Mrs. Clinton's book It Takes A Village, saying instead it takes a
family to properly raise a child."<p>

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw called Jesse Jackson "The father who
began on the outside looking in, the fiery liberal voice of
protest and change...The old lion still has his roar."
The Wednesday morning shows took the same approach to negativity:<p>

    -- CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart suggested: "Mrs.
Clinton, you know, has been the target of a lot of attacks by the
Republican Party. She decided not to answer them, although she
did say it takes a village."<p>

    -- On NBC's Today, Jim Miklaszewski proclaimed: "This was the
night for the liberals. Jesse Jackson electrified the delegates,
exhorting them not to abandon Democratic liberal traditions."
Bryant Gumbel asked: "Would it be fair to say she wasn't as
strident, as hard-edged last night as usual?" Miklaszewski
dissented from the media's party line: "If you listen closely, I
thought she was just as hard-edged as ever."<p>

    -- ABC's Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson
explained: "Mrs. Clinton expressed the core idea of the evening,
that government ought to be a proactive positive force, that idea
given forceful voice by two liberal icons who opposed President
Clinton's signing of welfare reform...the First Lady relied not
on her legal experience -- there would be no harsh edges on this
night -- but on her experience as a mother to push for new
legislation."<p>

    ABC interviewed Leon Panetta, and NBC interviewed the First
Lady, but asked no questions about negativity. Two weeks ago, the
morning shows all decried "bashing":<p>

   -- CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot reported August 14:
"It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San
Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with
a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

   -- "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack
dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the
President," Bryant Gumbel led off NBC's Today.<p>

    -- Good Morning America anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:
"Some of the harshest words were from Kay Bailey Hutchison, who
tried to paint the President as a tax-and-spend liberal." Charles
Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits."<p>


<center><h2><a name="where">Broder</a> Sounds A Rare Skeptical Note on Clinton, Welfare Fixer
Where Are Welfare Questions from the Right?</center></h2><p>

    Clinton officials assured conventioneers that he will "fix"
welfare reform after the election. That prompted The Washington
Post's David Broder, on CNN Tuesday night, to explain that
Democrats will be "the slickest sales people in the country" if
they cast Clinton as welfare's savior: "That's as logical as
saying that the guy who fumbled the ball on the two-yard line
ought to be put back in because he's the one who might carry it
through the next time." The networks have yet to suggest that his
welfare fix assurance might mean he really hasn't moved right on
the issue. Instead, liberal questions on welfare reform continued
on Wednesday night: <p>

    -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked Rep. John Lewis: "It's going
to be difficult, given the positions he's taken, particularly on
welfare, to get some people out?"<p>

    -- CNN's Gene Randall inquired of NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume:
"Do you think the President's signature on the welfare rights
bill will do him any harm politically in the African-American
community?"<p>

   -- On CNN Bob Franken asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan: "You of
course are very angry about the President signing the  welfare
legislation. But you haven't talked about it here. Why?" She
followed up: "Can the President, as many people suggest, fix the
welfare legislation in a second term?"<p>

    -- At the top of Tuesday's Nightline on the plight of
Chicago's poor, Ted Koppel warned: "They live literally in the
shadow of the convention in Chicago, but with their benefits now
in doubt, many feel betrayed by the President and the Democrats,
and look forward only to uncertainty."<p>



<center><h2><a name="labor">Labor's</a> Political Intolerance, Mob Ties Surface on TV
ABC, CNN Touch on Unions' Peculiar Politics</center></h2><p>

    While the labor unions have yet to receive the sort of Darth
Vader treatment reserved for Republican interest groups like the
Christian Coalition or the NRA, some reporters have presented
critical looks at the exercise of union power.<p>

    -- Last night, CNN became the first network to address the
issue of the unions' political intolerance, taking dues money
from Republican union members to elect Democrats. Reporter Wolf
Blitzer asked AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney: "Many of your members
are Republicans. How do you explain to them that you're using, in
effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"<p>

    -- CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a
story last night on the unions' political campaign in which he
observed: "So Bill Clinton says the era of big government is
over? Not at the Democratic convention, where unionized
government workers are suiting up for battle against
Republicans."<p>

    -- On Tuesday's World News Tonight, ABC's Brian Ross
reported: "In the world of big money and Democratic politics on
public display this week in Chicago, this man holds a special
place. His name is Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a
labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia,
the Laborers International has become one of the Democrats' top
money people, raising millions and gaining him special access to
the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the Clinton
administration has gone all out to court Coia and his union money
with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the
First Lady at a big union conference."<p>

    Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised
questions about whether the union's money to the Democrats had
bought it some kind of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the
allegations and instead quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that
let him keep his job and put him in charge of cleaning up the
union."<p>


<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Base Bias</h3><p>

    CBS Evening News is taking two different approaches to the
passionate poles that create each party's base. The day before
the Republican convention, CBS reporter John Roberts suggested
"hard-line anti-abortionists" controlled the Republican Party:
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them...so far
he rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots." <p>

    But on last night's broadcast, reporter Harry Smith's piece
on unions didn't talk about ideologically extreme unions pushing
around the party, but how Bill Clinton has failed to be liberal
enough for them:<p>

    "It still takes steel to make America's cars. It still takes
labor to get a Democrat elected President. But talk to the union
rank and file, and you'll find that their enthusiasm is less than
red hot.... We talked with United Auto Workers in Dearborn,
Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill Clinton's support
of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized labor will
invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this fall.
These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their
money's worth."<p>


<h3>Poor Ann</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw didn't ask about harsh negativity during a Tuesday
night interview with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who
"delivered that rollicking keynote speech against George Bush not
so long ago." Brokaw asked about strong women: "You paid the
price to some degree. You lost the governorship of Texas because
this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it, about the
role of women in American politics?" <p>


<h3>Brokaw: Right is Wrong</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw was hit Tuesday with an anti-GOP comment he made
in San Diego. Freelance newsman Marc Morano showed him a quote,
cited in Media Reality Check '96, in which Brokaw asked rape
victim Jan Licence after her speech: "Do you think this is a
party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated
by men as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very
much about what happens in America with rape?" <p>

    Brokaw read the quote, admitted "I did ask her that, which I
think is a fair question," then walked away. Earlier, Morano
asked why GOP delegates distrusted the media but Democrats don't.
Brokaw asserted that it's just because conservatives don't like
change: "I think a lot of reporters in fact, come from working
class, activist backgrounds. But I don't think that it really
colors the way that they report things and the conservatives
generally stand for the status quo and news is about change."<p>


<h3>Here's My Room Key!</h3><p>

    Great publicity isn't the only thing Bill Clinton picked up
on his train trip. Reporting on crowd reaction to Clinton's stop
at Michigan State University, NBC Nightly News on Wednesday found
one very giving student. Answering what she could give the
President, she yelled, "I'll give him my room key!" <p>


<h3>Used to Double Standard</h3><p>

    Reporters complained about the lack of hard news in San
Diego, but aren't doing so in Chicago. Radio host Don Imus asked
CBS's Bob Schieffer Wednesday morning why. Talk Daily reported
his response: "I guess we kind of got used to it."<p>

<i>"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that
applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people have
been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" <p>
-- NBC's Maria Shriver in an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton
after her August 27 speech </i>><p>

<center><h2><a name="networks">Networks</a> Concede It was a Liberal Night, But...
Hillary Asked to Respond to "Bitter Attacks"<p></center></h2>

    On Tuesday night the networks declared that speakers Mario
Cuomo, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton were liberals, but
instead of castigating Cuomo and Jackson for their negative
speeches, as they did with speakers in San Diego, they praised
their eloquence.  Like Monday night,
the Democrats again escaped any scrutiny of their intolerance on
abortion as the three broadcast networks each aired stories on
the disastrous impact of welfare reform.<p>

    -- Hillary portrayed as the victim of unwarranted Republican
attacks and given plenty of opportunities to fire back. Just
after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her nine
softball questions. See quote of the day below. For instance,
"You are credited with really redefining the role of First Lady
and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a
little less?" On CBS, Bob Schieffer asked her: "Weren't you a
little offended when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to
your book]?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer inquired of her: "What goes
through your mind when you hear some of these bitter attacks
against you?"<p>

    -- The three big speakers were tagged liberal by all but CBS.
Peter Jennings called Cuomo and Jackson the "senior liberals in
the party," and ABC's Jeff Greenfield described Hillary Clinton's
speech as "liberalism lite." Tom Brokaw referred to Cuomo's
"traditional liberal litany." CNN's Bill Schneider noted Hillary
Clinton's "liberal policy agenda." Whitewater was mentioned twice
by NBC last night; CNN's Judy Woodruff mentioned it Monday night.<p>

    -- The wealth of Democratic delegates and the quota system
that selected them have gone unmentioned in prime time so far. A
graphic on last night's NBC Nightly News reported 35 percent earn
over $100,000. In San Diego, 38 percent fell in that category,
prompting CBS, CNN and NBC to ask if the GOP delegates were out
of touch. Some reporters have noted that Democrats are split
50-50 male-female, but none has wondered if the quota system
might contradict party rhetoric about opposing quotas.<p>

    -- Abortion, the focus of the networks in San Diego, has been
blown aside in Chicago. Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and a supporter of partial birth
abortion, addressed the convention. But her early evening speech
failed to spur any talk about extremism. The Democrats at the
last minute also allowed pro-life Rep. Tony Hall to speak, but
that action didn't generate any media interest in why the
Democrats felt compelled to make the move. Abortion came up only
on CNN, but before prime time, as Judy Woodruff interviewed
former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey on the 7pm ET Inside
Politics.<p>

    -- Welfare reform reported from the viewpoint of potential
victims on ABC, CBS and NBC without any voices in favor of the
new law. <p>



<center><h2><a name="Kay">Slashing</a> Attacks on GOP Never Scorned As Negative
Reporters Swoon Over Cuomo, Jackson</center></h2><p>

    On Tuesday night in San Diego, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Rep. Susan Molinari made jokey remarks about President Clinton
and were tagged as "attack dogs." Last night, Jesse Jackson
declared: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense
against the Newt Gingrich contract, America's right-wing assault
on our elderly, our students, and our civil rights." Mario Cuomo
announced: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the
real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our
children. They are the real threat to clean air, clean water, and
the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells
hope and Republicans spell disaster." Did the media see "slashing
partisan attacks"? Hardly. Note each network's contrast: <p>

    -- CNN's Ken Bode oozed: "Convention rhetoric has not been
much better than it was tonight, particularly with Jesse Jackson.
And of course, no one's going to forget for some time the First
Lady's speech, which was also terrific."  Farai Chideya gushed:
"Jesse Jackson's speech was extraordinary in its sense of hope,
purpose, and vision." Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo: "It was
quite a scene watching as they listened to the speech. You really
are a fan of his speaking style. It's amazing, isn't it?"
In San Diego, CNN's Judy Woodruff declared: "Well, they said it
was going to be a Clinton-bashing night at the Republican
convention, Bernie, and I think that is just what we heard from
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bernard Shaw replied: "And the
bashing will continue when the keynote speaker, Susan Molinari,
steps up there."<p>

    -- Last night, ABC's Peter Jennings asserted: "Just a little
earlier this evening going out of their way, the Democrats were,
to show they embrace the differences among them or between them,
they put forward to speak two of the senior liberals in the party
who did more than anything else on this day to energize this
crowd."<p>
    In San Diego, Jennings began: "Expect tonight to see very
much the attacks on President Clinton ratcheted up to a much
greater degree than they have been so far." Sam Donaldson added:
"Tonight, as you say, Peter, they are expecting red
meat...Tonight they want to hear President Clinton bashed." <p>

    -- Last night, Dan Rather suggested on CBS: "Mrs. Clinton
received a ringing defense during what was clearly the most
stirring speech of the convention so far." Bob Schieffer added:
"The man who made that speech was Jesse Jackson, who can make a
speech when he sets his mind to it. But his biggest applause line
came when he said that Democrats must set up a line of defense to
protect the old and the young from the Republican assault, and
then he said, and to set up a line of defense against their
vicious attacks on the First Lady. The place just went wild when
he said that."<p>
    In San Diego, Rather said Hutchison "is expected to hit
President Clinton rhetorically with everything short of a tire
tube." Schieffer asked the Senator: "I must say it's Attack Dog
Hutchison tonight. How do you feel in this new role?" <p>

    -- Last night, Tom Brokaw noted: "The old lion has not lost
its roar. There are very few speakers left in America who can
switch on a hall like Jesse Jackson. He has done it so many times
in the past. He began tonight in more muted tones, but of course,it's almost irresistible for him, and it grows out of a very deep
passion." Tim Russert added: "The crowd is letting loose a little
bit because the passion and the philosophy of Jesse Jackson is
something they very much ascribe to, and by him bridging the gap
and endorsing Bill Clinton so wholeheartedly, it's a plus for
Bill Clinton."<p>
    In San Diego, Brokaw told NBC viewers: "The party knows
better than anyone else it has to lower the threshhold of
perceived meanness on the part of the country." Russert
underlined the point: "Key words: mean-spirited and extremist.
They want to avoid those labels...I think the speech by Senator
Hutchison is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean."<p>



<center><h2><a name="most">"Most Economists"</a> Blame Spending, Not Tax Cuts for Deficit
New Survey Proves Dole Tax Cut News Wrong</center></h2><p>
    A just released survey of 700 economists found that "52
percent blame the growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on
increased government spending more than on the Reagan tax cut,"
which was blamed by 48 percent. The fact that economists are
about evenly split contradicts many recent media reports.<p>

    "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the
budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced
reporter David Bloom on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague
Mike Jensen insisted a few minutes later that "most analysts say
it's not good economics."<p>

    The next morning a headline over a Washington Post news story
declared: "Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a
Boston Globe news story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's
Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big
Payoff."  <p>

    The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association
discovered that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts
increased economic growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see
the next Congress put a high priority on both restraining
government spending and cutting taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp
promise.<p>

    William Adams, a public administration professor at George
Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.
Though reported in this week's Weekly Standard and in Tuesday's
Washington Times, none of the above-mentioned outlets have yet
bothered to revise their claims.<p>


<center><h2><a name="voices">Voices</a> In Favor of Welfare Reform Vetoed by Networks
Welfare-State Television Sells the Liberal Line</center></h2><p>

    All three networks featured stories last night critical of
the new welfare reform law:<p>

    -- On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view: "There
are serious questions about what happens to these people after
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to
Indiana to look at the conflict between fixing the system and
doing the right thing by people." Mitchell featured no welfare
reform proponents, just social workers, Jesse Jackson, and
impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will get benefits for two
years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not she finds a job.
That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find work, she
is terrified."<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested:
"Maybe if he is reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to
reverse himself on welfare reform. Many of these delegates hope
so." Reporter Erin Hayes asked where the jobs would come from to
support welfare recipients: "An Urban League study found in
Chicago there are six times as many people who need work as there
are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no voices favoring
welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern as well:
the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an
answer. With so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is
no wonder there is fear out there."<p>

    -- On the CBS Evening News, reporter Harry Smith also ignored
taxpayers and focused on victims: "We talked to four welfare moms
from across Chicago. They feel like they are this year's
political target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last
week when he signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many
Americans support, but cuts these women think go too far." Smith
concluded: "Neighborhoods like Cabrini-Green have more than their
share of misery. Folks around here think misery is only going to
grow. Their long faith in the Democratic Party has been shaken,
and the actions of President Clinton confirm their fear that the
poor just do not count."<p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</center></h2><p>

<h3>Jack E. White Hot</h3><p>

    Time's Jack E. White exemplified the media's left-wing anger
against welfare reform in the September 2 issue: "Did anyone else
find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a
welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children
into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy
celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his
party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette,
Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms." White complained: "As Jesse
Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes
little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a
conservative Republican."<p>


<h3>Harshly Negative Attack</h3><p>

    In the same issue, Time columnist Margaret Carlson lit into 
the marriage of Bob and Elizabeth Dole: "Any time the Doles play
the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and
remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that
suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency
divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was
17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the
pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the
Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and
staying married gets you an inquisition."<p>


<h3>No Liberal Bias</h3><p>

    CBS News reporter Bob Schieffer told freelance newsman Marc
Morano in Chicago on Tuesday that the media don't tilt left: "I
think the media pretty well reflect American society. You know,
it's like when we had a draft army. You'd find one example of
everything there."<p>


<h3>Bayh vs. Molinari</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw put GOP keynoter Susan Molinari on the defensive
when he interviewed her two weeks ago on the NBC Nightly News,
but last night he took a more deferential approach in
interviewing Democratic keynote speaker Gov. Evan Bayh.
Molinari faced seven straight questions about abortion and women:
"So they look at the platform. It's pretty rigid in its language
on abortion. Then people like Susan Molinari and Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole say don't pay attention to the platform, pay attention
to what we do."<p>

    Brokaw also pressed Bayh from the left, but only made him
answer one hostile question: "If there is a debate in the party
at the moment, it is about welfare reform. A lot of Democrats, in
Congress especially, think we have gone too far, too fast, that a
lot of children, more than a million, could be put below the
poverty line." <p>

    Unlike with Molinari, Brokaw played up Bayh's rising star
status: "When you walk out tonight to deliver that keynote
speech, all over this hall and in the television booths and in
the print section, people are going to be saying `Evan Bayh,
future candidate for President of the United States. This is a
big moment for him.' You can't completely erase that from your
thinking?"<p>


<h3>Calling J.C. Watts</h3><p>

    Two weeks ago, ABC, CBS, and NBC carried none of Rep. J.C.
Watts' speech, which occurred during their live 10pm ET hour,
though GOP delegates loved it. Last night, ABC ran excerpts of
the pre-10pm ET addresses of Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo (and
on Nightline). CBS showed some Jackson clips.<p>

<center><h2><a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY</center></h2><p>

<i>"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of
your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet,
late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as
you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other welfare experts are
saying is going to throw a million children into poverty. Does
that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked
for over the years?"<p>
-- CNN's Judy Woodruff to Hillary Clinton,
August 26 interview</i><p> 

<center><h2><a name="Another">Another</a> Day of Questions from the Left
Liberal Delegates, But Party's Too Conservative</center></h2><p>

    Viewers of last night's network coverage could have learned
how Democratic delegates are outside the mainstream, but they
heard nothing about controversies like abortion, as the networks
again worried Clinton had gone too far right.<p>

    -- CBS and CNN attempted to make Hillary Clinton the martyr
of harsh San Diego attacks and ask her welfare questions from the
left. <p>

    -- Network reporters worried that the party has become too
conservative as they grilled Democrats for not opposing the
welfare reform bill. <p>

    -- ABC, CNN and PBS mentioned the liberal nature of the
delegates at least once, but not NBC or CBS in prime time. "We
know from our survey that these delgates are far to the left of
the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the
mainstream," ABC's Sam Donaldson declared last night. Unions also
got brief attention. Tom Brokaw referred to "a very unusually
high representation of labor down on the floor" and on CBS Dan
Rather also noted the labor angle.<p>

    -- Three networks mentioned tobacco funding of the
convention, but none noted the hypocrisy of Democrats taking
money from an industry they rail against. On CNN in prime time
Bill Schneider explained that the NRA and tobacco lobby are the
"least popular" special interests "and those are the two that the
Democrats are going to try to showcase as linked to the
Republican Party." On World News Tonight yesterday ABC's intrepid
Brian Ross cited a brunch cruise for delegates "put on by the
Brown and Williamson tobacco company" and how "Philip Morris has
the most extensive operation with the same group of back room
operatives who ran things in San Diego." NBC's Tom Brokaw
referred to a tobacco-sponsored event where delegates wore "Keep
the FDA off the farm" buttons. <p>

    -- Only two reporters questioned the authenticity of
Democratic claims to moderation. During the PBS-NBC joint
broadcast, Lisa Myers asked a delegate: "You have a President who
talks like a Republican, you have a platform that is so centrist
that some critics say it's a con job. Is this essentially,
though, a liberal party?" CNN's Judy Woodruff asked Bob Kerrey if
Clinton will go left after the election.<p>

    After scant attention Sunday, Democratic suppression of
abortion debate fell completely off TV screens.<P255D> In all of
Monday's prime time coverage no reporter or anchor raised the
topic, though Bob Casey, the pro-life former Governor of
Pennsylvania, gave a speech at another Chicago location on the
party's intolerance. <p>

<center><h2><a name="poor">CNN, CBS Ask First Lady About Harsh GOP Attacks, Welfare:
Poor Hillary, Wondering If It's Worth It</a></center></h2><p>

   In 1992, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff gave a soft convention
interview to Hillary Clinton in July, but blistered Barbara Bush
in August in Houston with a welter of accusatory questions about
the inappropriateness of Bush campaign tactics. On last night's
Inside Politics on CNN, Woodruff devoted her interview to
eliciting Hillary Clinton's responses to Republican attacks:<p>

    -- "Let me take you back to San Diego. Bob Dole said it
doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, which he said
has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. Is this
something that is going to become a major issue in this fall
campaign?"<p>

    -- "Also in San Diego, former president George Bush told the
delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the
dignity and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with
respect. And then he added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the
White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.' Does that
hurt coming from your immediate predecessor?"<p>

    -- "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of saying
that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?"<p>

    -- When Mrs. Clinton failed to answer sharply enough,
Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing a contrast
there...you're not hurt?"<p>

    Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics,
such as her reported role in firing and lodging criminal
accusations against seven workers of the White House Travel
Office, did not prevent CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart
from also presenting the First Lady as the beleaguered martyr of
unfortunate Republican attacks: <p>

    -- "In the San Diego Republican convention, you were the
subject of much conversation, and I think the target, I think
many would say, of some very serious attacks."<p>
 "Do you ever, seriously, in the White
House, when all the doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this
worth it'?"<p>

    Diaz-Balart also asked the First Lady two welfare questions
from the left: <p>

    -- "One thing you care very deeply about is children, and
even your supporters that work for children's rights have
criticized President Clinton's decision to okay the welfare
reform bill. What were your conversations with him when he was in
that period of really making a determination?"<p>

    -- "What would you say to the people in the Children's
Defense Fund [the liberal group she used to chair] who have
criticized it? What is your response to them?"<p>

    Woodruff also peppered the First Lady with welfare reform
questions, all six of them from the left. Here are three, another
is the quote of the day.<p>

    -- "Your close friend, Marian Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund, said the President's signing and this is
a quote, 'makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children,'
she said, 'it will leave a moral blot on his presidency and the
country that will never be forgotten.'"<p>

    -- "But if the bill is so flawed, why sign it? Why not work
to fix it, and sign it later?"<p>

    -- "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again
just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements
with the President to herself in private, but there were times
that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there
ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="networks">Democrats and Clinton Have Gone Too Far to the Right?
Networks Worry Democrats Not Liberal Enough</a></center></h2><p>

    Last night network correspondents worried how wise it has
been for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party to have moved to
the right and, in so doing, abandoned their liberal princples.
Tom Brokaw placed the party, which fought Republican efforts to
slow the rate of growth of government, to the right of center.<p>

    -- During PBS-NBC coverage, Margaret Warner asked Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center: "Does the President pay any
political price for turning his back on traditional liberalism,
that is, among enthusiasm among traditional Democrats?"<p>

    -- Later during NBC's solo time, Tom Brokaw interviewed VP Al
Gore and then observed to NBC's Tim Russert: "The Vice President
was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the Republicans,
we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first
place. But since 1994 they have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by the
name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to
be more pragmatic."<p>

    -- On CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's
been running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats
now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?" <p>

    -- Talking to Tom Hayden, Ed Bradley of CBS wondered:
"Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic Party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election,
they've given up their principles. Your response to that?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="For">For</a> Second Day, Focus is on Evils of Welfare Reform
"Slightly Terrified" of New Democrat Promises</h2></center><p>

    Just as on Sunday, last night the networks repeatedly pressed
Democrats from the left on Bill Clinton's signing of the welfare
reform bill. A PBS reporter wondered if it meant the dismantling
of the "safety net that took so long to put together."<p>

    -- CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Illinois Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun: "How does it feel, tell us, you voted against the
welfare reform bill, you're now obviously very supportive of the
President, tell us do you feel that he sort of betrayed some of
those values that you expressed. How can you go forward now and
support him after his decision to sign that welfare reform bill
into law?"<p>

    -- HHS Secretary Donna Shalala got it from the left during
PBS-NBC coverage as Tom Brokaw inquired: "If you were a poor
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the
right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real
skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next
two years?"<p>

    -- Earlier in the evening, Elizabeth Farnesworth of PBS
grilled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes: "We're
looking tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are.
Did the President turn his back on fundamental Democratic
principles when he signed the welfare bill?" She also forwarded a
liberal argument: "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing
the welfare bill is unraveling the safety net that took so long
to put together?"<p>

    -- ABC's Jeff Greenfield highlighted bewilderment in network
ranks about the acceptance of Clinton's retreat from liberalism
on the issue. Interviewing Congressman Charles Rangel, he asked:
"Congressman it used to be said that when the Democrats make a
firing squad they form a circle, they love to rebel against an
incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and the move
to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the
country, why is the dog not barking in the night? Why are you
staying with the President given that discontent?" <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></h2></center><p>

<h3>Harsh or Enthusiastic?</h3><p>

    Bill Clinton and Bob Dole attacked each other on Sunday, but
for CBS This Morning, only Bob Dole was harsh. Sandra Hughes
reported Monday: "Dole's big moment yesterday came when he
stormed Chicago, and launch-ed a harsh attack against the man of
the hour there, Bill Clinton." <p>

    But a few minutes earlier Bill Plante reviewed Clinton's
train trip, admiringly noting that "at each whistle stop Mr.
Clinton threw himself enthusiastically into campaign mode,
leaning deep into every crowd and lacing his remarks with
partisan fire." <p>

    So are the Democratic candidates avoiding harsh personal
attacks? On Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked
Senator Christopher Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the
word out,' that I don't want to hear personal attacks against the
Republicans at this convention. Yesterday on his train trip the
President accused Republicans of blackmail to get their budget.
Al Gore, yesterday, accused the Republicans of ignorance and
audacity, talked about the two-headed monster of Dole and
Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of the House, of the
Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said they're
radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"<p>


<h3>Gumbel's Gripe</h3><p>

    Monday Bryant Gumbel couldn't stop from taking one more shot
at Republicans for an image he helped create. Interviewing
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley on Today, he queried: "The
Republicans, as you know, took a lot of criticism for the
scripting of their convention and for presenting an image that
was contrary to their platform. How do you figure this convention
is going to be different?"<p>
<h3>Ignoring Casey's Case</h3><p>

    Former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, banned from the
Democratic convention podium for the second party gathering in a
row, gave an impassioned pro-life speech yesterday at Chicago's
Fischer Center. Despite a reported heavy media presence at his
speech (which he wanted to make at the convention), none of the
networks aired the Casey speech story on last night's evening
news shows. <p>

    In his new book Fighting For Life, Casey remembered the 1992
platform hearings: "There were many Democrats, I said, who
opposed our party's embrace of the radical pro-abortion lobby.
Often it seemed the Democratic National Committee had become
little more than an auxiliary of NARAL -- the National Abortion
Rights Action League."<p>

    On Monday's Nightline, ABC's Chris Bury gave Casey 15 seconds
of fame: "The Democrats in Chicago, like the Republicans in San
Diego, have tried to script any spontaneity right out of the
program. Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, whose strong
anti-abortion views defy the party's position, had to find
cameras outside the convention hall."<p>


<h3>At Hillary's Side</h3><p>

    As a CBS camera panned the United Center last night it came
upon a man standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton. Dan Rather
identified him: "The gentleman in the dark suit to the right of
the frame, who was just framed out, Les Moonves of CBS. And the
chant takes up `four more years.' The lady, the First Lady from
Chicago with the smashing smile, is age 48. She and President
Clinton have been married for 20 years." Moonves's job with CBS?
President of the entertainment division.<p>

<i>"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that
with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform
bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor
children on the street?"<p>
-- Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an
interview on the August 25 CBS Evening News</i><p>


<center><h2><a name="Weekend">Weekend</a> Shows Fail to Apply GOP Level of Scrutiny
Democrats Not Portrayed as Intolerant, Extreme</h2></center><p>

    Unlike Republicans two Sundays ago, Democrats yesterday did
not come under assault from the networks over their intolerance
on abortion. While the subject was raised a few times, the
networks spent more time raising liberal criticisms of the
welfare reform bill President Clinton just signed. Findings from
weekend coverage:<p>

    -- Democrats faced about one-third as many questions about
abortion and the exclusion of dissenting speakers. Two weeks ago,
the Sunday morning shows asked 27 questions about the GOP split
on abortion and the failure to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to speak.
Interviewers asked only 10 questions yesterday, perhaps because
unlike inviting pro-choice Wilson and pro-life Bay Buchanan weeks
before, pro-life Democrats like Gov. Bob Casey were not booked,
despite Casey's Friday Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking the
"intolerance" of a "gag rule party." CNN's Late Edition asked
only two questions, compared to 11 posed to the GOP; NBC's Meet
the Press asked six questions, compared to nine for the GOP.
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley had two questions instead of
four, and CBS's Face the Nation offered zero abortion questions,
compared to three in San Diego.<p>
 
    -- No mention of corporate contributions to the Democratic
convention, not even of the hypocrisy of accepting funds from
tobacco companies while Clinton attacks them with rhetoric and
new regulations. Two weeks ago on Meet the Press, David Broder
twice asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour about the hypocrisy of
accepting corporate money for the convention while promising
campaign finance reform. On the Friday, August 23 World News
Tonight, however, ABC's Brian Ross did do a story on the top ten
corporate contributors to the DNC, including "a labor union under
federal investigation for its ties to the mafia."<p>

    -- No questions were posed about how unions have taken over
the Democratic Party. A Washington Post survey of Democratic
delegates found 34 percent belong to a union. Friday's Wall
Street Journal noted that "more than 400 delegates -- roughly one
in ten -- will be members of the National Education Association."
But that failed to generate questions about who controls the
party. <p>

    Only 21 percent of GOP delegates said they were part of the
religious right, but in San Diego CBS worried about their having
too much influence. On Sunday August 11, Face the Nation guests
got five ominous questions. "There are a number of Republicans
who are very uncomfortable with what they feel is the power, the
control that the conservative religious right has. Are you
concerned about that?" CBS reporter Phil Jones asked Texas
Governor George W. Bush.<p>

    -- Democrats called too conservative, charged from the left
with going too far on welfare reform.



<center><h2><a name="Just">Just</a> as in San Diego, Networks Attack from the Left
Network Stars Line Up for Welfare Status Quo</center></h2><p>

    The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in
San Diego, and on Sunday they also came at Democrats from the
left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about welfare
reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray himself
as a centrist. Dan Rather wondered if the party had gone "too far
to the right?"<p>

    -- Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal set the tone of liberal
anger on Saturday night's CNN Capital Gang: "Jesse Jackson and a
few others will complain and I think a majority of the delegates
here privately agree with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that
supporters of this bill, quote, 'will take this disgrace to their
graves,' end quote. They know Bill Clinton put his own political
interests ahead of the well being of little children." <p>

    --  Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of DNC
General Chairman Chris Dodd: "It's an issue of morality to many
people, and how can you defend a President who basically said to
the Congressional Democrats: Listen, that's your view, but I'm
doing this, because -- was it politically expedient?"<p>

    -- Talking with Democratic strategist James Carville later in
the show, Russert reminded viewers that he once toiled for former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo: "But the Democratic Party for
sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee
payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you
have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this
is what I stand for'?"<p>

    -- On yesterday's Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked Chicago Mayor Richard Daley: "The party looks a lot more
united right now. But we have a sense that there are some
underlying divisions and particularly this week with the
President signing a welfare bill that a lot of people think is
going to put children into poverty. And I guess the question is
that in a city like this, aren't you scared about what is going
to happen? Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of
hungry children?"<p>

    -- Minutes later while interviewing Indiana Governor Evan
Bayh, Braver pictured the Democrats as being too conservative: "I
just wondered what you think is the really big difference between
the Democrats and Republicans in this election? What would make
people go Democrat when it seems like the Democrats are moving so
close to Republican positions?"<p>

    --  Last night Dan Rather joined the chorus, inquiring of
Braver on the CBS Evening News: "Rita, how worried are the
Democrats about protests from some here that the party is running
too far to the right, particularly on welfare reform?"  <p>

<center><h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks for the Week to Come:</a>
A Look Back at San Diego</center></h2><p>

    Before the networks begin their prime time coverage in
Chicago, here's a brief summary of how they covered the
Republican convention in San Diego. <p>

    -- Labeling. Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates
were described as conservative more than three times as often as
moderate, but reporters also used more extreme labels than
moderate labels. The networks employed 46 conservative labels
(including 16 references to extreme conservatism) to only 13
moderate labels.<p>

    -- Agenda of Questions. Reporters posed more than seven times
as many questions from the liberal agenda as they did from a
conservative agenda: 51 questions from the left, compared to only
six questions from the right.<p>

    -- Controversies. Reporters referred to the Republican
Party's split on the abortion issue, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
"disinvitation" to speak, on 55 occasions in prime time. In 1992,
the Democrats' spiking of Gov. Bob Casey surfaced only six times
(once on NBC, five times on CNN). ABC and CBS never acknowledged
the Casey flap.<p>


<center><h2><a name="Sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Unpopular Koppel</h3><p>

Most people think Ted Koppel was wrong to leave the Republican
convention early, a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found. On
yesterday's Fox News Sunday, host Tony Snow reported that when
asked if Koppel was "justified in leaving," 52 percent said no,
31 percent responded yes and 16 percent were undecided. On
Tuesday of the GOP gathering, Koppel announced Nightline would
leave because "this convention is more infomercial than a news
event." <p>


<h3>Moderate" Democrats?</h3><p>

"Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation"
declared the headline on the front of the Sunday Washington
Post's convention section. Four pages later the Post headline
over a story on a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning
More Liberal Than Their Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82
percent favor affirmative action, 65 percent are against a
balanced budget amendment, 72 percent oppose "reducing spending
on social programs," but 65 percent want less defense spending.<p>


<h3>Hillary the Revolutionary</h3><p>

Sam Donaldson identified Hillary Clinton's problem on yesterday's
This Week with David Brinkley: "I think much of the opposition to
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a strong-willed
woman doing things in a man's arena, and we men don't seem to
like that." <p>
After George Will pointed out that politics is the arena of many
women, from Margaret Thatcher to Indira Gandhi, Cokie Roberts
retorted that she's been an "agent of change" and "it's very
difficult for the world to accept people who have been
revolutionaries."<p>

    <h2><center>Three items today:<p></center></h2>

1) The Republican Party has been "captured by the extremists" and
"Don't you get mad" when the First Lady is criticized, just two
of Dan Rather's statements and questions to Bill Clinton for 60
Minutes on Sunday night.<p>
2) For a former Washington Post reporter the Republican
convention reminded her of slaughtered Indians and of Reagan's
mean policies.<p>
3) Just about everyone in Hollywood showed up at or served as
host for President Clinton's 50th birthday bash Sunday night. One
major celebrity shouted that "Dole sucks!"<p>

 1) Sunday afternoon Dan Rather interviewed President Clinton
for that night's 60 Minutes. Dan Rather started out by asking:
"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying, 'yes
the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a
pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's been
captured by the extremists in the Republican Party, the radical
part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich. Is that
what you think?"<p>

    Rather showed Clinton video of criticisms from Bob Dole and
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at the Republican convention. Almost
apologetic, Rather noted, "You said your hope is it can be fought
out on the issues, but one more thing from the convention, then
I'll give you a chance to respond to it. As you must know,
whether you watched the convention or not, the Republicans fired
a number of shots at the First Lady. Some samples. Former
President Bush said, quote, 'Mrs. Bush upheld the honor of the
White House, and did it with class and style and caring and
love.'....I don't know of anyone in the convention who didn't
take that as a difference of the present First Lady and the
former First Lady."<p>
    
    After Clinton responded, Rather implored: "Don't you get mad,
Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"<p>

     2) And before you forget the media's animosity toward the
Republican convention, here's a portion of a commentary piece in
Friday's USA Today by Jill Nelson, a former Washington Post
reporter: <p>
    "I found it hard not to cringe. I was embarrassed by the
specter of everyone's favorite black man, Colin Powell, lecturing
us on why he became a Republican and referring to a  divine
providence that gave us this land.' Tell that to the Native
Americans who were slaughtered in the name of 'divine
providence.' I felt manipulated, not moved, by Nancy Reagan's
tribute to her Ronnie as some sort of caring everyman,
considering that under Reagan the rich got richer, the national
debt skyrocketed, and working Americans were left holding the
bag."<p>

    3 ) Sunday night the Democratic Party held a series of
birthday parties in New York City and around the country for
President Clinton. The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove reported
Monday that in addition to emcee Whoopi Goldberg that attending
celebrities included Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Jon Bon Jovi,
Aretha Franklin, and James Earl Jones. <p>

    Monday's New York Post added these names to the celebrity
list: Leslie Nielsen, Tim Conway, Ted Danson and Mary
Steenburgen. The New York Post's Cindy Adams reported: "The party
was beamed around the country by satellite so other celebs could
get a chance to host a shindig of their very own: In L.A.,
Nicolas Cage and his wife, Patricia Arquette, played host. In San
Francisco it was Michael Keaton, who has never, ever done
anything political before. In Baltimore, it was Valerie Harper;
in Boston, Judy Collins; in Nashville, L.L. Cool J; in Denver,
C.C. Wayans...."<p>
 
    The Washington Post's Grove relayed that at one of the NYC
bashes, "Comedian and morning television host Rosie O'Donnell
entertained the crowd by shouting, 'Dole sucks!'"<p>

    A very inclusionary and tolerant message. -- Brent Baker.<p>

<center><h2>Quote of the Day</h2><p></center>

<i>"Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a Russian 
television reporter said today that this is as tightly controlled 
as anything the Communist Party ever put on, Tom." <p>
-- Reporter 
David Bloom from the convention floor to anchor Tom Brokaw, 
August 14 NBC Nightly News.</i><p>
<center><h2><a name="finally">Finally Find a Republican They Like, But Still Attack 
Rest Elizabeth Dole: "Masterful"</h2></center><p>

It took until the third night, but Wednesday evening the networks 
finally found a Republican they could respect: Elizabeth Dole. 
However, they still spent yesterday morning and evening 
disparaging speakers who had criticized President Clinton and 
questioning the credibility of Jack Kemp for changing his 
position on affirmative action and immigration.<p>

"Absolutely powerful performance," gushed Dan Rather after 
Elizabeth Dole finished her reflections on Bob Doles life. "It 
was masterful," agreed Tim Russert on NBC where Tom Brokaw 
explained: "In the language of this summer, ladies and gentlemen, 
that was a gold medal performance." ABCs Peter Jennings 
pronounced it "an unquestionably brilliant piece of stagecraft by 
Mrs. Dole."<p>

Yesterday, network viewers also heard:<p>

Jack Kemp has "damaged his credibility" by altering his positions 
on affirmative action and immigration. Lesley Stahl asked if he's 
selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?" ABC suggested it 
fights the very image that hes built for himself as an 
independent thinker." Kemp adjusted two views, all of Clintons 
are usually in constant motion. Will networks focus on that in 
Chicago? <p>

Networks come to Clintons defense and say Tuesday night speakers 
went too far in their harsh criticism of Clinton. CBS insisted 
Susan Molinari went after Clinton "with a vengeance" and Good 
Morning America's Elizabeth Vargas claimed "some of the harshest 
words were from Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bryant 
Gumbel wondered if anyone is "seeing any evidence" of tolerance 
from Republicans. And NBCs Maria Shriver asked "how ugly" 
Republicans will make the fall campaign. <p>

Reporters may like Elizabeth Dole, but they still hold a grudge 
against Marilyn Quayle. ABCs Michel McQueen recalled the 
"strident tone" of her 1992 convention address as NBCs Tom 
Brokaw also charged last night that Mrs. Quayle was "too 
strident." <p>

<center><h2><a name="gop">GOP</a> Criticized for Attacking Clinton*s "Eating Habits";
Decrying "Bash Bill Night"</h2></center><p>
Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came through loud and clear Wednesday morning and night. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged The New York Times.<p>

"Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant Gumbel began Wednesday's Today.<p>

NBC*s morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions. Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the contrary?"<p>

Today's Katie Couric inquired of Republican Charles Black: "Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP. How do you address that?" Couric asked Pat Buchanan: "Your speech at the 1992 Republican convention, where you talked about a religious war, was considered by many to be very polarizing, a real turn-off, self-righteous, superior, exclusionary. Do you regret giving this speech?"<p>

CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot declared: "It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted: "Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." GMA co-host Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap, Republicans have had problems attacting minorities, a party that has traditionally been home to the angry white man."<p>

Last night NBC*s Lisa Myers demanded of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "Some of the focus groups which had watched your speech...voters found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect do you think you went too far?"<p>

Calling conservatives "extremists" has been a Democratic mantra for two years, but NBC*s Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken Khachigian: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this going to get?" No uglier than the media in San Diego.<p>

<center><h2><a name="clinton">Will</a> Clinton Be Held to the Same Standard in Chicago?</h2>
<h3>Jack Kemp, the Political "Acrobat"</h3></center><p>

The choice of Jack Kemp as Dole's running mate prompted the media to point out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified those two views to reflect the party's platform, the media are accusing him of abandoning principle.<p>

While reporters portray President Clinton's flip-flops on every issue as "moving to the center," they don't see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to 
attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, in prime time last night CBS's Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"<p>

Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility?"<p>

On World News Tonight ABC's Jackie Judd asserted that "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She then looked at his affirmative action change, noting "that left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned." She concluded: "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker."<p>

<center><h2><a name="cheese">Want</a> Some Cheese With Your Whine? </h2>
<h3>Koppel Cops Out of San Diego</h3></center>

Ted Koppel is angry. As quoted by Martha Moore in the August 14 USA Today, he complained that convention planners always exert as much control over coverage as possible, but this year, "`I think the politicians are ahead,'" says ABC's Ted Koppel, who took his Nightline show back to Washington today, two days early. `They have more control over what we put on the air this week than they have ever had before.'"<p>

Just how successful have planners been? According to USA Today ABC filled a bit over half of their broadcast on Monday, 34 minutes out of an hour, with actual convention proceedings. On Tuesday, ABC aired even less of the convention, 26 out of 66 minutes broadcast. ABC filled the rest with interviews, analysis and ads.<p>

Koppel sounded like a restless child in his Tuesday Nightline announcement: "This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event. Nothing surprising has happened, nothing surprising is anticipated. Frankly, we expect the Democratic convention in Chicago to be much of the same. Indeed the only reason we were planning to originate these Nightline broadcasts from Chicago in another couple of week was a sense of fairness. And then it occurred to us that perhaps we should learn from our experience. There was a time when the national political conventions were news events of such complexity that they required the presence of thousands of journalists , but not this year. If anything important happens we will certainly have an adequate staff here to cover it and we will send an equivalent unit to Chicago. But we don*t all have to be here so most of us from Nightline are going home tomorrow."<p>

Such is the sad state of American journalism: Koppel's Nightline broadcast five stories about Tonya Harding in 1994, many more about O.J. Simpson, but will only turn in two on the 1996 Republican convention."<p>

Reporters couldn't help but praise Elizabeth Dole, but Marilyn Quayle 
still hasn't lived down the media's feminist fury over her 1992 convention 
speech. On Tuesday night, ABC's Michel McQueen said: "I ran into Marilyn 
Quayle today, who gave a speech in 1992 that was kind of a 'peel the 
paint off the walls' speech that was described later on as contributing 
to a rather strident tone of the '92 convention. She told me she was 
shocked by the way it was received afterwards."<p>

After Dan Quayle's speech last night, NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled: "Marilyn 
Quayle, who spoke at the convention four years ago, and many people 
thought that her speech was too strident, talking about the place 
of women, critical of the feminist movement in this country at the 
time."<p>



<center><h2><a name="rapping">Rapping</a> Reagan's Film</h2></center>
<p>
Remember Bill Clinton's "Man From Hope" video during the 1992 Democratic convention? The sugary-sweet film was shown on all the networks and was widely praised for adding insight into Bill Clinton. But the Republican*s equally sweet video of President Ronald Reagan on Tuesday night touched off a round of media carping as to the video*s value as news.
<p>
As James Bennet reported in Wednesday*s New York Times, Jeff Zucker, Executive Producer of NBC coverage, said: "Let me say if I had to do it again, I would really give that a second thought...I*m not as convinced, Monday morning quarterbacking myself, that it was as newsworthy as I thought going in."
<p>
CBS officials clucked about their decision to pass over the video, hoping for more of a movie of the week flavor. "Lane Venardos, a CBS vice president, sounded equally comfortable with his decision to ignore the film almost completely. "We decided on news value alone not to run it," he said. "There was not one scintilla of new information." Mr. Venardos said convention planners had promised the video would include "new pictures of the former President, never-before-seen post-Alzheimer's-onset pictures."
<p>
<h3>Clinton: Fiscal Conservative</h3>
<p>
In the August 19 edition, Newsweek's six-million-dollar "anonymous" author, Joe Klein, declared the GOP faithful "entered their convention on a mild, quasi-delusional wave of enthusiasm. The rest of us will be forgiven for yawning: the Dole tax cut stands, to all but hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the budget? Does anyone actually believe this? The trouble is, after all the deficit reduction of the past few years, there isn*t much non-incendiary matter left on the federal level to cut."
<p>
Time's George Church sneered: "Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not seem to add up." Church concluded: "A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton."
<p>
<h3>Candace Capitalizes</h3>
<p>
On Wednesday's Today, NBC's Jamie Gangel did a feature on  Candace Gingrich which painted a very unsympathetic portrait of the lesbian*s half-brother Newt: "Gingrich went on to call Candace a sinner. He's also compared homosexuality to alcoholism and is against legislation that would protect gays from being fired because of their sexual orientation." 
<p>
Gangel said to Candace: "You're being very polite about the fact that your brother says terrible things about homosexuals....He doesn't return your phone calls. He doesn't answer your faxes. He doesn't respond to his own sister. That's okay with you?"
<p>
Gangel never attempted to understand how the Speaker might feel: that Candace has capitalized on her half-brother's fame (complete with a guest star appearance on Friends by making him look insensitive, and that replying to any call or fax might lead to another batch of negative publicity.
Gangel simply claimed: "Candace says she is not trying to hurt her brother. She just wants equal rights and hopes people will learn to accept gay relationships."
<p>
<h3>Kemp's flip flops.</h3>
<p>
	When Bob Dole announced his choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, the media quickly pointed out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified his views to reflect those of the party platform, the media is accusing him of flip-flopping.
<p>
	On CNN's coverage of the convention, political analyst Ken Bode was quick to attack Kemp: "Today Jack Kemp did a double back dive ten degree of difficulty on the issues of immigration and affirmative action." Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, CBS' Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole."
<p>
	While reporters consider President Clinton's flip-flops "moving to the center," they don*t see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On the August 14 CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn*t that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility."
<p>
	The questions were no different on the floor of the convention. On the August 14 World News Tonight, ABC's Jackie Judd got her angle from a liberal California delegate, claiming Kemp had "abandoned" that wing of the party. She started her story: "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions to get in line with Bob Dole." It's not so unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to accommodate the views of the presidential candidate, but Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he*s built for himself as an independent thinker."

<h3>Speaking of Infomercials...</h3>
<p>
As network stars grumble about the tightly scripted "infomercial" the GOP convention has become, perhaps they should remember the infomercial-like tone some reporters employed to promote the Clinton-Gore ticket at their New York City convention in 1992:
ABC*s Jim Wooten introduced the convention on July 13, 1992: "That*s the ticket. Not a liberal in sight and that*s the picture Clinton wants the convention to leave with the country. Democrats happily moving from their liberal past to their centrist future...So Clinton and his moderates have captured the Democratic Party for the moment."
<p>
In the next morning's New York Times, reporter David Rosenbaum echoed ABC: "The views that dominated the party for so long, what was proudly called liberal, are hardly in evidence in Madison Square Garden this week...Mr. Mondale, who in 1984 was the last down-the-line liberal to win the Democratic presidential nomination and who lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in November, said he was resigned to the change."
<p>
On the evening of July 14, 1992 Dan Rather announced: "Delegates approved the Clinton-Gore center-of-the-road Democratic Party platform, trying to move the party closer to the voters around the malls in America*s suburbs."
<p>
CBS This Morning reporter Bill Plante touted Clinton's momentum: "Everything seems to be going Clinton's way. They couldn't be happier here. They say that the candidate*s numbers are improving every day. They have their moderate platform. And things are just generally where they would want them to be."
<p>
Peter Jennings claimed on July 15, 1992: "He's become a little more disciplined, Bill Clinton, but you know he loves a crowd. And he has, don*t want to get carried away here, but he has the kind of hands people respond to."
<p>
From the floor of the convention NBC's Maria Shriver merely tried to get Elizabeth Glaser to repeat her nasty attack on Ronald Reagan: "You place responsibility for the death of your daughter [from AIDS] squarely at the feet of the Reagan administration. Do you believe they are responsible for that?"
<p>
Before savaging Barbara Bush in August, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff asked Hillary Clinton: "The Clinton campaign has been saying that this is a week that they were trying to tell the American people more about who Bill Clinton really is...What is it that you think the American people should know about your husband that they may not know or may not understand?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="women">Women</a> Naturally Scared by Republican Policies</h2> 
<h3>Morning Lectures on Tolerance</h3> </center><p>
 
Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated interviews on Tuesday's Today and Good Morning  
America.<p> 
 
Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whittman and  Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, GMA's Charlie Gibson laid out why women are  
turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party that did  
take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the  
prime beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party  
that took the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and  
Medicaid. It is the Republican Party now that is trying to make  
an issue of denying education and benefits to the children of  
illegal immigrants. It is the Republican Party that has rejected  
in the last week or so, tolerance language on abortion in the  
platform."<p> 
 
Then he asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform  
hearings to get language included in the platform that simply  
asked for toleration of dissenting views particularly on  
abortion. It was language that Bob Dole wanted in the platform.  
The party rejected him, it rejected your views, all three of you  
in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel comfortable in it  
with its position on tolerance?"<p> 
 
Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the  
party platform trouble you? Does the fact that that some of these  
governors opted not to speak because they were told they could  
not discuss their views on abortion, do all those things make you  
basically doubt that this is a big tent here?"<p> 
 
Tom Brokaw wondered: "Gen. Powell, the difference between having  
a position in your heart and campaigning on something as Jack  
Kemp now is going to be forced to do, is going to say to a lot of  
black Americans and a lot of people who feel that they are denied  
full access to the privilege of being a citizen in this country,  
`thats just utter hypocrisy. What is there in this platform or  
in this party tonight that says to the rest of the African- 
Americans out there, come on in, theres a place for you?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="reporters">Reporters</a> Stick to "Extremist" Labels on Republicans  
</h2> 
<h3>Media Echoes of Clinton Consultants</h3></center> <p>
 
Using the description extreme to tar the Republican party did  
not begin in the convention aisles of San Diego, but in the  
sullen liberal reaction to the Republicans electoral sweep in  
1994. Clinton consultant Dick Morris advised his White House  
clients to tag their opponents as extremist while at the same  
time stealing many of their positions. The media echoed the  
Morris strategy. MediaWatch analysts used the Nexis news data  
retrieval system to search for the word extreme within 25 words  
of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time,  
Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) and USA Today from  
January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. <p> 
 
Analysts discovered reporters did not use many extremist labels  
in 1993 and 1994  41  but 26 of those were applied to  
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only  
five for the Democrats who ruled both ends of Pennsylvania  
Avenue. Liberal moves to insure abortion on demand, gays in the  
military, nationalized health care, and massive tax increases  
werent beyond the media pale.  <p> 
 
But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were  
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found  
"extremes" on both sides. Just two mentioned "extreme" Democrats.  
In total, these six print outlets employed 149 extreme labels for  
Republicans to just seven for the Democrats.<p> 
 
USA Todays Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican  
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff  
upper lip as they continue to oppose `extreme GOP cuts." Many of  
these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came  
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borgers March 11, 1996  
U.S. News suggestion that "taking on Buchananism would be good  
for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich was  
Washingtons resident extremist."<p> 
 
U.S. News & World Report reporter Kenneth Walsh claimed on March  
25, 1996: "Clintons feuds with some allies will make it harder  
to label him a liberal extremist, George Bush in 1988 caricatured  
Michael Dukakis." On October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted:  
"President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge against the  
Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews.  
Democrats are rallying to his side as he defends the poor and  
elderly against GOP `extremism."<p> 
 
The "extreme" pattern also occurred in television coverage of the  
1996 presidential primaries. MediaWatch analysts studied the  
application of labels in primary stories from a week before the  
New Hampshire primary (February 13) to the South Carolina primary  
(March 2). Republicans and their supporters were labeled on 73  
occasions  45 of those extreme labels, almost all applied to  
Pat Buchanan. On February 25, 1996, CBS weekend anchor John  
Roberts asked consultant Joe Klein: "Some call Buchanan an  
extremist. Others call him American as apple pie. What is this  
fellows appeal?" Answered Klein: "He is both. He is an extremist  
and as American as apple pie." Using the same research parameters  
for a similar three-week period during the 1992 Democratic  
primaries, featuring ultraliberals like Tom Harkin and Jerry  
Brown, reporters used no extremist labels and only four  
applications of "liberal," all in the first two days of the study  
period.<p> 
 
In 1995, the networks introduced GOP presidential candidates by  
noting their "extremism." In 40 network stories introducing  
potential Republican challengers to Clinton, network reporters  
used 54 labels, 49 of which were "conservative" or more extreme.  
In fact, 19 labels, or 35 percent of the total, were labels such  
as "right," "far right," "hard right," "hard-line," "extremist,"  
'Republican fringe," and "ultraconservative fringe." On the  
February 24, 1995 CBS Evening News, reporter Linda Douglass  
alleged: "For years, critics have called [Sen. Phil] Gramm an  
extremist. But he argues these days his ideas are in the  
mainstream." In 27 stories introducing the Democratic candidates  
in 1991, none ever used an extreme term like "far left" or  
"ultraliberal."<p> 

<center><h2><a name="bryant">Bryant</a> Gumbel Scolds Delegates for Lack of Inclusion
But NBC Calls GOP-TV Unfair</h2></center> 

To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media, NBCs 
Bob Faw reported Tuesday morning the RNC launched GOP-TV to 
provide complete convention coverage. Faw asserted: "What GOP TV 
calls unfiltered, doesnt even begin to pay lip service to 
balance or fairness." NBC should know.<p> 

Heres how Bryant Gumbel opened the Tuesday Today: "Good morning. 
Retired general Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, 
addressed the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers 
with accounts of why he became a Republican and why hell vote 
for Bob Dole. But although his speech was generally well-
received, the reception was restrained, and there were boos 
whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed 
and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of 
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can 
expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."
Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that 
"Jonathan Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP TV has started something 
deceptive and unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political 
propaganda, masquarading as news, and thats a problem."<p>

Political propaganda masquerading as news? Sounds like Bryant 
Gumbel.<p>

<center><h2>Republican Officials Grilled by Network Reporters
A <a name="Tax">Tax</a> on Credibility</h2></center>

The credibility of Bob Doles tax cut proposal arose as a topic 
for skeptical questions Tuesday night.<p> 

On PBS, referring to a Concord Coalition official, Margaret 
	Warner inquired of Dole economist John Taylor: "Does Martha 
Phillips have a point that its hard to credibly make the case 
that you can both cut taxes and balance the budget?"<p>

NBCs Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Governor Christie Todd 
Whitman: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Doles proposal for the 
economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. 
Why is he wrong?"<p>

Early in the evening, Tom Brokaw demanded of Virginias George 
Allen: "Governor, are you not at all concerned about what happens 
to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that 
weve done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent 
tax cut?"<p>

And: "But if you say to your constituents in the state of 
Virginia, Listen, were going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but 
I cant touch 60 percent of the budget that were dealing with 
here, and thats the reality thats facing Bob Dole because of 
Medicare and defense spending and other things, do you think that 
we can get home-free here in seven years and balance the 
budget?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="Hutchison">Hutchison</a> Speech Tagged "Dangerous" by NBC: Republicans Pummeled from the Left </h2></center>

"Tonight they're ready to take on the Clinton record and try to convince 
a lot of undecided voters that this party is more inclusive than its 
reputation," Peter Jennings announced at the start of ABC's convention 
coverage Tuesday night. But the networks wouldn't let the Republicans 
succeed. NBC Nightly News on Tuesday night devoted its "In 
Depth" segment to "a major problem for the GOP, the gender gap, moderate 
women feeling left out."<p>

A few hours later NBC's Tim Russert relayed as accurate the Democratic 
analysis of the address by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He 
charged: "Key words: Mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid 
those labels. They have thus far after two days and that's why you're 
not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time tonight. I think the 
speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she 
uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."<p>

Before the speech, Dan Rather offered a classic Ratherism: "Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison has now come out to the podium. She's expected 
to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with everything short of a 
tire tube." But for the second night in a row Republicans were 
bombarded with questions and analysis that portrayed them as extreme 
and intolerant of anything outside their "rigid" views.<p>

The networks peppered the Republicans with questions from the liberal agenda. 
While the majority of questions dwelled on poll numbers and tactical gambits, 
interviews in the first two nights of prime-time network coverage 
featured 35 questions and statements from the left, to only four from 
the right. The evening newscasts contained eight liberal questions 
to zero conservative inquiries. One observation from the right last 
night: CNN's Judy Woodruff noting that "as a pro-life delegate said 
to me this morning..'I was interested in what Colin Powell had to 
say last night but I'm wondering when we're going to hear from a pro-liife 
point of view at the podium?'" For liberal questions, see pages 2 
and 3. <p>

Coverage focused on gender gap and intolerance on abortion as 
reporters suggested it's rational for women to not back the GOP. 

<center><h2><a name="Speechless">Speechless</a> Networks</h2></center>

In their "coverage" of the convention last night, none of the 
three broadcast networks gave any live airtime to prime time 
speeches by Reps. John Kasich and J.C. Watts and Gov. Christie 
Whitman. While ABC and CBS did show Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchisons 
speech in its entirety, NBC aired less than 2.5 minutes of it. 
While Hutchison was still speaking, NBC cut to Tim Russert, who 
gave the Democratic "rapid response" to it  even before it was 
over.<p>

Russert quoted the Democrats press release: "Once again the 
Republicans have showed the face of Bob Dole and Newt Gingrichs 
Republican Party through Sen. Hutchisons speech. It is nasty, 
gratuitous attacks against the President of the United States and 
mean-spirited." According to Russert, Hutchison gave the 
Democrats "what they wanted in order to respond in this way. 
Viewers just had to take his word for it.<p>

<h3>Summary or Pillory?</h3>

Tuesdays New York Times "convention summary" trashed the GOP 
platform: "The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, 
careening to the right on social issues like immigration, 
welfare, and homosexual rights, and omitting the word 'tolerance 
in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter 
intraparty debate."<p>

<h3>Two CBS Spins on Powell</h3>

Monday night Dan Rather said: "General Colin Powell was generally 
applauded by most of the delegates. There was a point, however, 
when he was clearly booed by many of the delegates in this hall. 
It wasnt just a case of scattered boos when Colin Powell said `I 
support a womans right to choose on abortion, and `Im a 
supporter of affirmative action. Thats the point when the boos 
came."<p>

On Tuesdays CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart delivered 
a different take: "General Colin Powell was the four-star hero of 
the evening, moving the crowd to numerous standing ovations and 
even cheers for his most controversial comments."<p>

<h3>Attention Bill Paxon</h3>

Keynote speaker Susan Molinari isnt married? During Tuesdays 
World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings posed this question to 
an ABC reporter: "I want to go down to the floor for a moment to 
ask a fairly important question of Michel McQueen. Susan 
Molinari: single, white professional woman is going to be up 
there. You could argue that shes going to look out of place in 
some respects at this convention, couldnt you?" A few minutes 
later Jennings admitted he had `goofed.'<p>

<h3>A Bit of Media Intolerance?</h3>

As three MRC employees were leaving the Horton Grand Hotel in San 
Diego on Tuesday, they were approached by a woman wearing a 
Dateline NBC hat, traveling with three credentialed NBC 
cameramen. She inquired if their `Team Clinton' T-shirts were 
pro-Clinton, to which one MRC employee replied, "No, you have to 
read the whole thing." After she read the `pro-Clinton press 
corps' caption on the shirt featuring a drawing of three TV 
anchors, she quipped, "Oh, theyre anti-media. I guess the term 
`extremist still fits, huh?"<p>

<center><h2>Republicans Called Unconcerned About <a name="rape">Rape</a> Victims:
Another Round of Media Intolerance</h2></center>

Prime time and the evening news shows again emphasized how the 
Republican Party is shutting out pro-choicers and on how women 
are turned off by the party's stands. See page one for a tally on 
the agenda of questions.<p>

Keynoter Susan Molinari got grilled from the left by Tom 
	Brokaw on NBC Nightly News: After asking about how women can 
relate to a platform  that's "pretty rigid in its language on 
abortion," he posed this question: "In the convention hall itself 
tonight, as you try to reach out to American women across all 
spectrums of American life, you have here a delegates [sic] by a 
factor of two to one, white males, many of whom are making more 
than $100,000 a year. Doesnt that make it difficult for a lot of 
American women to identify with...."<p>

Just after rape victim Jan Licence's speech on victims rights 
last night, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled: "But why [speak 
out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that 
they dont think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is 
supportive of womens issues. Why make this stand here?" Tom 
Brokaw interviewed Licence later and asked: "Do you think -- this 
is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is 
dominated by men as well...Do you think before tonight they 
thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"<p>

ABC's Peter Jennings endorsed the "rights" spin of women who 
oppose the GOP's abortion plank: "Polls commissioned by the 
Republican party show they have lost nearly ten percent of women 
since they have voted the Republican majority into the 104th 
Congress in 1994. The right to abortion has never been an over-
whelming issue for women at election time. But this fight within 
the Republican party has many Republican women questioning how 
far this party is willing to go to limit their rights."<p>

Michel McQueen of ABC found the Democratic quota system to be 
better: "When you go to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 
two weeks youll see that half the delegates on the floor are 
women. And thats a powerful message when half the voters are 
women. But dramatically its also true that women have not 
responded well to a message that at times been considered too 
harsh, too mean."<p>

Iran-Contra affair. But for the members of this party, there is  
no more beloved figure." <p>

<P> 
<P> 
Monday's coverage of the Republican convention was a near carbon  
copy of the themes emphasized over the weekend. Viewers of Monday's  
morning shows heard repeated questions about why the Republicans excluded  
pro-choice voices. On the evening shows and in prime time coverage  
they heard references to the GOP's harsh, and extreme platform.  
Several reporters used retired General Colin Powell's speech as a  
foil to contrast his themes against the media-promoted image of the  
1992 convention. 
<P> 
Looking at the bright side of the Jack Kemp pick, on Today 
Monday morning NBC's Tim Russert argued it might prevent the  
GOP from employing a certain strategy: "This may be an enormous  
public service. If Jack Kemp's presence on the Republican ticket  
neutralizes the race issue, if the race card is not played in 1996  
because of Jack Kemp, he will have achieved more than any national  
figure in a long time. In 1988, the Willie Horton ad. Jack Kemp has  
said that was just absurd."

Couric posed seven questions about abortion, even demanding that Dole's  
daughter Robin explain her abortion views. She asked Senator Kay  
Bailey Hutchison: "Do you still believe you can call the Republican  
Party an inclusive party?" See page 3.

Conventioneers Battered with Abortion Questions All Day 
<P> 
The networks stayed on message in harping on Republican exclusion  
of pro-abortion podium speakers. Just after noon Pacific time  
CNN's Charles Bierbauer asked Congressman Sam Brownback of  
Kansas: "But haven't some of those who might feel that abortion  
rights defensible, haven't they been excluded?" Candy Crowley  
asked pro-abortion Sen. Arlen Specter: "Do you think there is  
ever going to be room on the Republican ticket for someone like  
you?" 
<P> 
On NBC's Today on Monday, Katie Couric posed at least seven  
abortion questions.  To Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You know a  
lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive  
party, one that can embrace the views of various people. Given  
the way the platform has worked out vis a vis abortion, and the  
fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking  
because they felt, as if they were being censored. Do you still  
believe you can call the Republican Party an inclusive party?" 
<p> 
During the 1992 convention, Couric only asked Clinton's mother  
Virginia Kelley puff questions: "I also read in the many things  
that have been written about your son and his childhood that he  
used to walk to church alone with a Bible under his arm.' But  
Couric felt compelled yesterday to ask Dole's daughter Robin:  
"You all don't agree on all things political. I know you differ  
with him in terms of his views on abortion. Do you have  
discussions? Do you talk about it, talk it out, exchange views?" 
<P> 
But CNN exemplified an ironic new twist: excluding or downplaying  
conservatives wasn't censorship, but cleverly manipulative stage  
management. Reporter Frank Sesno declared Monday afternoon: "The  
placement of the various speakers at this convention is very  
purposeful and during this session, during this afternoon, some  
of the more hard line conservative speakers, such as Sam  
Brownback, were placed. We're not going to hear that rough edge  
tonight in prime time. Sesno's tone grew sharper: "The keynote  
speech will be delivered by a woman by the name of Susan  
Molinari. She is someone who is here with a very deliberate aim,  
and that is to take a belt sander to some of the sharper edges of  
the Republican Party." 
<P> 
ABC's Peter Jennings told Monday's San Diego Union Tribune:  
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain,  
isolate, or box in other voices , and both parties do it , then  
you almost invariably attract the attention of journalists." But  
Jennings ignored the Democrats' spiking of Bob Casey in 1992.  
Whether he lives up to his own statements this year will be  
tested in two weeks in Chicago.

Following Colin Powell's speech, reporters quickly pointed out the difference between this convention and  
the "divisive" Houston convention in 1992.   
<DD>  
Andrea Mitchell declared on MSNBC: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat Buchanan set  
the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the same prime time starring role on the first night  
of the convention and that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George Bush's chance  
of winning re-election because it set a very narrow, exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had  
the contrast of Colin Powell."  
<DD>  
On Monday's Good Morning America, host Charles Gibson couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention  
that is going to be harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat of Houston  
1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention." While never mentioning that raising taxes  
could have cost Bush the election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one thing  
that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter  
divisive convention four years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for re-election. Dole  
knows that only too well."

With the GOP showcasing the inoffensive lineup of former  
Presidents Ford and Bush as well as retired General Colin Powell,  
the networks made sure viewers learned that the Republican  
platform still upheld the party's ideological hard line. 
<P> 
NBC's David Bloom announced an amalgam of antis on Monday's  
Nightly News: "But not a word today from Bob Dole about the tough  
anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action, anti-abortion platform  
adopted this afternoon at the convention hall." Later in the  
show, NBC's Lisa Myers ended a story: "One Dole strategist has a  
different standard [of convention success]. He said he'll  
consider this convention a hit if the viewers end the week  
thinking Republicans aren't quite as scary as they thought." 
<P> 
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote,  
harsh, extreme, even radical. Do you see it that way?" Dan Rather  
asked Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS Evening News.  
<P> 
During prime time, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl added: "The whole  
purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is to  
diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's what's  
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the  
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was  
yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin  
Powell, he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find  
that extreme. It's turning them off." 






<CENTER><H2><a name="gutless">Gutless</a> Moderates?</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
In the August 19 Newsweek, Senior Editor Jonathan Alter gave pro- 
abortion Republicans his recipe for political success. In a piece  
titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice Republicans  
insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates are  
too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country." 
<P> 
The crux of Alter's wisdom? Attack your most loyal voting block:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his  
position in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was  
such a supporter of family planning as a congressman that he was  
called 'Rubbers,' but by the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is  
pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform  
language and planks that he has raised basic questions about his  
leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis Schlafly, how would  
he handle a Saddam Hussein?" 
<P> 
Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party  
that shut Governor Bob Casey out of its  1992 convention for his  
pro-life views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should  
emulate: "The only real way to change the Republican Party is  
for...a pro-choice candidate to run for President in  
2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate Republican will take  
a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and enter a few  
primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can finally  
pitch that big tent they like to talk about."

Two reporters cheered Colin Powell's denunciation of corporate  
welfare last night, but they failed to mention which party tried  
to reduce it or how NBC is a recipient. 
On MSNBC, correspondent Andrea Mitchell never reflected on the  
hard choice her own network made when NBC decided to make money  
in prime time by joining up with PBS for convention coverage:  
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin  
Powell's speech is that he did talk about the hard choices and he  
said, 'Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have  
to give up corporate welfare as well and that entitlements are  
the real issue.'" 
<P> 
PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to Gary Bauer after Powell  
left the podium: "You heard the reaction in the room at the  
conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that  
when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the  
wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you  
think this crowd is really receiving this message."

<CENTER><H3>Tax Plan Declared Failed Reaganomics</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
The offering of tax cuts is universally seen as good politics,  
but that doesn't mean reporters won't try to make them unpopular.  
Bob Dole's new tax cut proposal and selection of Jack Kemp as his  
running mate may be making headway in the polls, but journalits  
are trying to put on the brakes. For reporters all tax cuts are  
bad.     
<P> 
Brand new CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart declared  
Monday: "It will be interesting to see if Bob Dole, who'd been  
skeptical of supply-siders like Jack Kemp in the past, can sell  
this to the American people without being perceived as a  
hypocrite." Other reporters assumed that supply-side economics is  
a failed doctrine and that tax cuts will "balloon" the deficit as  
they allegedly did in the Reagan years: 
<P> 
Just before noon Pacific time on Monday, CNN's Bob Franken asked  
George Shultz on the convention floor: "I wanted to talk to you  
about the fact that you worked with Republican Bob Dole on his  
economic plank. Were you pleased that there were tax cuts in  
there, and do you worry about the budget deficit ballooning as a  
result?" 
<P> 
On Inside Washington just before Dole released his plan, Newsweek  
Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas declared: "There are millions  
of quotes from Bob Dole all through the '80s saying, Look, you  
can't just cut taxes and expect the economy to do much better.  
Now he's screeched around, 180 degrees, and he's sounding like a  
pie-in-the-sky, Reaganomics professor. It's, it doesn't suit his  
character and he's giving up some high ground. Now Bill Clinton  
looks like the responsible guy." 
<P> 
Headline in the August 5 USA Today: "Dole's Tax Plan Could  
Backfire, Experts Say: Deficits, interest rates could rise."  
NBC reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5,  
Nightly News: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did  
worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan."  
Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They  
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did  
during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by  
future generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." 
<P> 
Minutes after Dole's tax cut address that day, U.S. News & World  
Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer suggested on CNN that the  
people didn't care about fiscal realities: "I think it's going to  
sell very well among those who, for one thing, think that  
government is taxing them too heavily and don't have a  
calculator, don't particularly care about the details of federal  
fiscal policy and don't particularly want to add up the  
dimensions of the problem or stare into the future that we know  
we face." 
<P> 
<P> 
Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman stressed in the August 12 issue  
that Dole "risks his most cherished asset: his credibility...Now  
he's embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career , so late in his  
campaign , it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that  
the annual deficit on his watch , and that he's a champion of  
fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole." 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="reality">Reality</a> Check:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's Investor's Business Daily pointed out: "Just turn to  
page 369 of the 'Economic Report of the President'...A table  
shows that receipts from individual income taxes rose to $446  
billion in fiscal '89, President Reagan's last budget, from $286  
billion in fiscal '81, the year Reagan began to slash personal  
rates. That's a 56 percent gain. Annualized, tax receipts grew  
faster than the period's average 4 percent inflation. The problem  
was clearly NOT a fall in revenues. It was the other side of the  
ledger: Spending grew even faster. Look at the 'total outlays''  
column in the same table. Spending rose to $1.143 trillion in '89  
from $678 billion in '81. That's a 69 percent gain. It's no  
surprise that Clinton, a professional politician, would brush  
over such inconvenient facts. Media figures who claim to have no  
hidden agendas, on the other hand, have no excuse."  
<P>
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="inside">On Inside</a> Washington:</H3></CENTER>

Evan Thomas, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief: "I think 
this is really disappointing. 
<P> And more advice from the left from Thomas: "Maybe pandering  
works,  
but the polls don't show that. The polls, I think, even Dole's  
own  
polls show that most people reject this tax cut because they  
don't  
believe it. They got conned in the 1980s by Reagan, they got a  
tax cut, 
but they still got a, it didn't do what he predicted it would do 
to the economy. They're in a highly cynical mode, I don't think 
they believe his pandering. In fact, if you ask the question, 'Do 
you approve a tax cut if it would increase the deficit?' only 11 
percent of the country, according to one reputable poll, went 
for it, so I think it's lose-lose." 

<CENTER><H2><a name="millionaire">Millionaire</a> Anchors Tag GOP Delegates As Out of Touch with Middle America</h2></center>
<P> 
<P> 
Early in Monday's PBS/NBC coverage, Tom Brokaw asked: "The big question, of course, what is the  
Republican Party these days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are overwhelmingly white  
and male, male by a factor of about two to one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of  
the people here earn more than $100,000 a year." Some additional examples from Monday of how the  
networks created an image for viewers of an out of touch elite gathered in San Diego: 
<P> 
Ed Bradley on the CBS Evening News last night: "For the most part they are white, male, and they are  
older than the average American. They are also more conservative than the average American. They are  
also wealthier , about a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<P> 
Dan Rather in prime time: "Delegates in this convention have been selected, inspected, detected,  
categorized by the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly male,  
overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and almost one in five of these delegates is a  
millionaire." 
<P> 
CNN's Judy Woodruff to Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What?  
43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that  
send to the country, you think? 
<P> 
Woodruff again last night: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and asked him about, among other  
things, the fact that not only not just the language in the platform , only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is not a convention that is  
necessarily representative even of the broader Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much  
less the electorate overall." 
<P> 
So, will these reporters apply equal treatment to the unreprersentative Democrats gathering in Chicago in a  
few days?  <p>

<h3> Quote of the Day:</h3>
"Governor, looking at this platform writing the last week, what

independent voter in this country?" -- CBS correspondent Phil
Jones to Texas Governor George W. Bush, August 11 Face the
Nation.

<h3>Call GOPers Mean, Intolerant & Hard Line
Media's Unwelcome Greeting</h3>
<p>
Republicans and conservatives came under media assault in the
days  and hours before they assembled at the San Diego Convention
Center. The intolerance of conservatives, their hard line stance
on abortion  and mean-spirited nature were the dominant themes of
weekend coverage  on the networks. Though VP nominee Jack Kemp
largely escaped condemnation,  network analysts used praise of
him as an opportunity to impugn conservatives overall.
<p>
<h3>Inside today's edition:</h3>
<p>
Mean-spirited and hateful  Republicans. CBS, CNN and ABC all
refer to "mean-spirited" conservatives. The Wall Street Journal's
Al Hunt tagged the  platform as "mean-spirited." CNN's Bill
Schneider charged that "they're  supposed to be haters" as "most
conservatives these days," such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
"come across as mean." CNN's Judy Woodruff  said that at least
Kemp does not like the idea of "yanking money away  from welfare
mothers with small children." See page 2.
<p>
Intolerant Republicans Bar Wilson from Speaking. On four Sunday
network mornings shows
Republicans were pounded with 22 questions about why pro-choice
Governors Pete  Wilson and Bill Weld were not going to be allowed
to speak. That's  a dramatic contrast to what happened in 1992
when the networks virtually ignored the Democratic Party decision
to bar pro-life Governor Bill Casey from speaking to their
convention. Wilson apeared on ABC, but  the network didn't
interview Casey in 1992. See page 3.
<p>
"Rogue Elephants" Take Over GOP and Spell Sure Defeat. Using
labels to paint delegates as extremists, CBS aired several
stories about the ominous takeover of the Republican Party by, in
Dan Rather's words, "the hard right." CBS reporter Linda Douglass
worried that if Bob Dole appears to be "under the thumb of
religious conservatives" he'll go down to defeat. See page 4.

<h3>GOP Called "Mean" & Conservatives Dubbed "Haters"
TV Analysts Turn Nasty</h3>
<p>
A  "mean-spirited" and "divisive" convention attended by "haters"
is how some network reporters and analysts, especially CNN s Bill
Schneider, have described the Republican convention and
conservatives over the past few days. Often, the comment came in
backhanded insults in stories praising Jack Kemp s tolerance.
Here, in date order, are some specific examples:
<p>
CBS s Russ Mitchell. On Friday s CBS This Morning, co-host Russ
Mitchell asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992
convention was called, even by some Republicans, divisive and
mean-spirited. How will this convention be different?"
<p>
CNN's Bill Schneider. Hours later on Inside Politics Bill
Schneider, CNN s polling analyst, praised Jack Kemp by impugning
conservatives: "He is a rare combination a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They re
supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute ago about the
frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp is buoyant, he s
effusive, he s inclusive of everybody in the country, not just in
the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that ticket."
<p>
ABC s Cokie Roberts. Then on Friday night's World News Tonight
Cokie Roberts also insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good
choice: "He s very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for
affirmative action. And I think that s very important for this
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen
somewhat dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with
a big smile on his face saying you all come, and I m going to cut
your taxes while I m at it is not a bad thing for the
Republicans."
<p>
CNN s Al Hunt. On the August 10 Capital Gang Saturday night Al
Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal,
disparaged the platform while praising the Kemp pick: "But, you
know, privately the Democrats know that this is an enlightened
choice, whatever Chris Dodd may say publicly. Jack Kemp is gonna
not only excite this convention, but he cuts across regional,
racial and generational lines, across all of America, and I think
that he and his incredibly attractive family are going to add
lustre and intellectual firepower. Now there are some risks. He
has a few flaky views, the gold standard for one, and more
important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who cares about all
people and that s going to put him at odds with a platform that
is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration, insensitive to
racial minorities."
<p>
CNN s Judy Woodruff: During live coverage Saturday of the VP
announcement in  Russell, Kansas,  Judy Woodruff declared: "On
welfare, up through the last few years, he s advocated more
moderate policies than those that were passed this month by the
Republican-controlled Congress. Jack Kemp does not like the idea
of taking money yanking money way from welfare mothers with small
children."
<p>  
CNNs Schneider. On Saturday s Inside Politics Schneider again
impugned conservatives as he praised Jack Kemp s tolerance: "Kemp
also has a rare combination of qualities. He s a nice
conservative. There haven t been too many of those since Ronald
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video
of Newt Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan]. Kemp is
tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship with
minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration
measure in California. Kemp is not a hater." 
<p>
So most conservatives are? Sounds like a bit of mean-spirited
name calling on behalf of the media.

<p>  
<h3>Networks That Ignored Casey Dive Into GOP Controversy
The Fascinating Wilson Flap</h3>
<p>  
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked Dole adviser Donald Rumsfeld on This
Week with David Brinkley yesterday: "We just heard Jim Wooten
talking about [California Gov.] Pete Wilson not talking at this
convention. Governor Weld is also not talking at this  
convention. Republicans for years have been talking about the
Democrats not allowing [then-Pennsylvania Gov.] Bob Casey to talk
at their last convention. What s different here?" What s
different is that the lack of speaking assignments for Weld and
Wilson are spurring major media interest. 
<p>
Just during the Sunday morning interview shows, the networks
asked 22 questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans.
During the entire Democratic convention week in 1992, Casey s
predicament drew absolutely no mention from Cokie s network, nor
any attention from CBS; NBC aired just one interview with Gov.
Casey, as did CNN, which added four other mentions of the
underplayed controversy  in prime time. Yesterday, 11 questions
about the GOP s  exclusion of moderates were posed on CNN s Late
Edition, compared to five on NBC s Meet the Press, four on ABC s
This Week, and two on CBS's Face the Nation.
<p>
If pro-choice forces cannot prevail, then why even hold a
convention asked one morning show host last week. Today co-host
Matt Lauer asked Gov. Wilson on  August 8: "You said a second ago
that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your
side on this issue, but the majority of people who ll attend this
convention are not. Why then even hold the convention if it
doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people
in the party?"

<p>  
<h3>Sixty TV Stories on the GOP to One for the Democrats
Abortion Plank Imbalance</h3>
<p>  
As the surf arrives on San Diego s beaches, once again the
national media are hanging ten on their favorite convention
story: Republican fratricide over the platform s abortion
plank. Since April 30, when Governors Weld, Wilson, Whitman, and
Pataki declared their intention to challenge the platform s
traditional pro-life plank, the networks have focused like a
laser beam on the story, while ignoring any debate within the
Democratic party:
<p>
>From April 30 to August 9, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and
NBC) have favored the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1.
They  aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, to only one
ABC World News Tonight story on the Democratic abortion debate on
June 12. The network morning shows have aired another 30 full
stories or interview segments on the GOP abortion debate, to
nothing on the Democrats. (That doesn t include five anchor
briefs on the evening shows and 34 anchor briefs on the morning
shows.)
<p>
CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories
and ten anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one
anchor brief on the Democrats. CNN s Inside Politics was
intensely interested in the story, with 38 full stories or
interview segments on the GOP to two segments on the Democrats.
<p>
Perhaps the dramatic imbalance of stories will change when the
Democrats hold their platform hearings? Wrong. The Democrats
already held their platform hearings (on July 10 and 11, then
concluding on August 5) with absolutely no notice from ABC, CBS,
or NBC. You also couldn't read about them in Time, Newsweek, or
U.S. News & World Report. Even daily newspapers such as the Los
Angeles Times and USA Today, with hundreds of pages of newsprint
to fill every week, spiked the story.
<p>
Judd, June 12: "An ABC News survey shows that a third of
Democrats oppose all or most abortions, but centrists and
liberals have no intention of surrendering any ground." Judd
dismissed the threat of pro-lifers actually leaving the party:
"The issue of abortion has not splintered the Democratic party
because those who couldn t live with the party's position
bolted years ago." She concluded: "So given their reluctance to
publicly fight with the party mainstream, abortion opponents will
probably be seen, but not heard at their party's convention this
summer."

<h3>Networks Worry About Ominous Party Takeover by Christians
"Rogue Elephants" No More</h3>
<p>
Colin Powell and Susan Molinari are set to deliver major speeches
to the Republican convention, but network news reporters over the
weekend portrayed the Republican Party as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Christian Right, painting that as an ominous
development. 
<p>
On Friday, August 9, Dan Rather introduced a CBS Evening News
piece by asserting: "For many self-described Christian
conservatives and other members of what is generally known as the
hard right of the Republican Party, they ve been pretty much
having their way at the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp
news late today was one more cause for celebration. But there
could be pitfalls ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda
Douglass."
<p>
Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate." Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she
continued: "The Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted
here, even forcing Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance
to supporters of abortion rights. Religious conservatives say
they now hold the key to a Dole victory in November."
<p>
After a soundbite from the Christian Coalition s Ralph Reed,
Douglass continued: "But veterans of past Republican presidential
campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of appearing to be under the
thumb of religious conservatives. Some analysts believe Gerald
Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a conservative faction.
Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said Dole must be careful." 
The same night on PBS s Washington Week in Review host Ken Bode
claimed that "it turns out that this platform committee that met
is a far more conservative group of delegates, than we've
seen even in Republican conventions of the past."
<p>
On Sunday s Face the Nation, CBS correspondent Phil Jones seemed
obsessed with the topic. Jones asked Governor George Bush, "There
are a number of Republicans who are very uncomfortable with what
they feel is the power, the control that the conservative
Religious Right has. Are you concerned about that?" Jones also
accused Pat Robertson of swallowing the Republican Party: "A lot
of moderate Republicans have watched what s going on here in the
last week in the writing of the platform, and they say you
people, you, Pat Robertson and your wing of the Republican party,
Christian conservatives, have taken over."
<p>
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them," warned
Dan Rather on last night s CBS Evening News. Taking a look at the
Texas delegation, reporter John Roberts found that "so far the
rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots: winning the
platform battle over abortion and heavily influencing Bob Dole s
choice for Vice President." 
<p>
Employing some extremist labeling, Roberts said that "hardline
anti-abortionists" tried to keep Texas Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison from becoming a delegate. But in the end, Roberts
assured viewers, the conservatives really won't win: "This
exercise in gaining political influence may turn out to be just
that: an exercise. Bob Dole says he has not yet read the party
platform and even if he does he says he will not feel bound by
it. And it could be a case for the Texas delegation of
winning the battle but losing the war. Their views against
abortion are in contrast with the majority of Americans who
support a woman s right to choose. That could turn out to be a
contentious issue come November."

<p>
<dd>    Two topics today put together with the assistance of Tim
Lamer back in our Alexandria, Virginia office:
<ol>
<li>CNN and ABC praised the likely choice of Jack Kemp as VP
nominee by contrasting him with most conservatives who are
"mean" and "haters." 
<li>CBS reporter Linda Douglass filed a story Friday night in
which she argued that the appearance that Dole is "under the
thumb of religious conservatives," what Dan Rather referred to
as "the hard right of the Republican Party," could doom his
campaign.
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<dd><li> On Friday's CBS This Morning, Russ Mitchell asked RNC
Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992 convention was called,
even by some Republicans, divisive and mean-spirited. How will
this convention be different?"
<p>
<dd>    Hours later on CNN's Inside Politics Bill Schneider praised Jack
Kemp by impugning conservatives: "He is a rare combination -- a
nice conservative. These days conservatives are supposed to be
mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute
ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the
country, not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different
face on that ticket."
<p>
<dd>    Then on Friday night's World News Tonight Cokie Roberts also
insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good choice: "He's
very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive, reaching out to
minorities, to women, being for immigration, for affirmative
action. And I think that's very important for this particular
convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat dour,
and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile
on his face saying you all come, and I'm going to cut your taxes
while I'm at it is not a bad thing for the Republicans."
<p>
<dd><li>Dan Rather introduced a Friday night Evening News piece:
"For many self-described Christian conservatives and other

<h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>    One item today: <p></center></h3>
A Media Reality Check '96 fax report released Wednesday 
afternoon. Back on June 22, 1992 CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn 
announced: "Making headlines this morning: Bill Clinton comes up with a 
plan for the economy. Tax the rich, cut the deficit, and help just about 
everyone else." That's not quite how reporters have greeted Bob Dole's tax 
cut plan. In this report we compared and contrasted how media outlets which
have tried to discredit Dole's proposal were the very same outlets which
praised Clinton's economic and health plans.<p>
    The following is the text of the report put together by Tim Graham with 
the assistance of Tim Lamer and the rest of our crew in Alexandria: <p>

<center><h3>The Voodoo Gap: The Media's Partisan Economics</center></h3><p>

<i>SAN DIEGO, CA</i> -- Bob Dole's tax cut proposal was quickly denigrated by 
reporters as the unwelcome return of irresponsible Reaganomics, but the 
outpouring of media skepticism about Dole's tax proposal in no way resembles 
the national media's salesmanlike reaction to Clinton proposals in 1992 and 
1993.<p>

"Raising questions about how Bob Dole's going to cut taxes and balance the 
budget is fair," said MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III. "What's not fair is 
attacking Dole's credibility after you've swallowed Clinton's bizarre fiscal 
estimates whole. After passing on the fantasy of a self-financing Clinton 
health plan and 1,000 descriptions of Medicare `cuts,' the media ought to
think about their own credibility on budget matters before they pretend to be 
nonpartisan skeptics of Dole." Among the outlets with a bad case of partisan 
economics:<p>
 
NBC. Reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5, 1996 Nightly News:  
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and 
many are skeptical of Dole's plan." Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" 
minutes later: "They say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as 
they did during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by future 
generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." NBC did not note as 
columnist James Glassman pointed out Tuesday, that according to Clinton's own
Economic Report of the President, tax revenues increased from $601 billion in 
1983 to $991 billion in 1989, but spending rose from $808 billion in 1983 to 
$1.143 trillion in 1989.<p>

Clinton often drew praise. NBC reporter Lisa Myers raved on the February 18, 
1993 Today: "The President deserved great, great credit for having the courage 
to come forward with a plan to deal responsibly with the deficit." NBC's Andrea 
Mitchell worried about his image on the May 2, 1993 Meet the Press: "This is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do something 
about deficit reduction and take on health care, and somehow he's not selling 
that. He's still being perceived as an old-style Democrat."<p>
 
CBS. Reporter Linda Douglass declared on the July 23, 1996 CBS Evening News: 
"Dole will have to tread carefully as he promotes his tax cut. Each of the 
proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and 
Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive up the deficit."<p>
 
But on the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, Douglass simply passed on 
Clinton's notion of paying for 37 million uninsured Americans' health care -- 
with a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide for much new in the way of 
taxes, just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come 
from savings in spending." The Clinton health proposal was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office to cost $784 billion in its first seven years.<p>

U.S. News & World Report. Senior Writer Susan Dentzer was the first to 
condemn Dole's tax cut on CNN just minutes after Dole was finished: "The old 
joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a ditch gets out
of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there are a fair amount of 
assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan that really, I think, under
intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." Appearing on Nightline a few 
hours later, she called the Dole plan "a free lunch."<p>
 
Dentzer, on the other hand, applauded Clinton's micromanagement of the 
economy in the March 15, 1993 U.S. News: "Amid a broader economic plan that 
has its share of flaws, Clinton's well-crafted stimulus is a piece worth 
keeping...The sorts of spending the President has picked -- for example on 
education or on long-planned highway projects -- tend to create lots of jobs, 
many which carry high wages and benefits."<p>
 
Newsweek. Reporter Howard Fineman wrote in the latest issue that Dole "risks 
his most cherished asset: his credibility....Now he's embracing supply-side 
economics, years after it came (and went) in GOP circles. So late in his career 
-- so late in the campaign -- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag 
that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a 
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."<p>

Fineman had a different idea of who was responsible for the deficit on the 
October 11, 1995 Fox Morning News: "He [Clinton] really doesn't have to put 
numbers on the table. It's the Republicans who have said they're the 
revolutionaries. They're the ones with the responsibility."<p>
 
Time. Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame declared on September 20, 1993: 
"The Clinton plan is surprisingly persuasive in supporting the long-time 
claim of the Clintons and their top health care strategist, Ira Magaziner, 
that [health] reform can be almost entirely from savings, without broad-based 
new taxes and with enough left over to reduce the federal budget deficit." 
But in the January 29, 1996 issue, Goodgame described the 1980s as "when top
tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-
siders are often described as optimists." <p>

<h2> ***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center><p>
 <center><h3>One item today:</h3></center><p>
    A Republican Party platform subcommittee passed a plank stating:
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes 
differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength."<p>
    Nonetheless, the very networks which barely touched in 1992 the refusal
of the Democratic Party to allow Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey to make a 
pro-life speech at their convention, pounced on the GOP Tuesday night for 
intolerance.<p>
    --  Here's how Peter Jennings opened the August 6 World News Tonight: 
"Good evening. We begin tonight with what you could certainly call zero 
tolerance. As much as Bob Dole would like to have the nation focus on his
very sweeping tax cutting proposals of yesterday, the men and woman who
will join him at his party's political convention in a few days are once 
again involved in a power struggle about abortion. Today by the time Mr. 
Dole spoke by satellite to his party's delegates, who were already gathered
in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had 
disappeared from the party's platform."<p>

    -- On the NBC Nightly News reporter Gwen Ifill's piece ended by showing 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld saying in a soundbite: "I don't want to 
drum the pro-lifers out of the party. I just want there to be room for me 
and them within the same description of the party."<p>
    Ifill then concluded: "But there's not enough room for the words abortion 
and tolerance to co-exist in this party's platform. Dole is gambling that 
voters care more about the economy and taxes than they do abortion. But he 
has undercut moderate Republicans at a time when he needs every vote he can 
get. Gwen Ifill, NBC News, San Diego."<p>

     It just shows that it pays to suppress any dissent. When you allow debate
and what reporters consider the wrong side wins they call you intolerant. <p>

<h3>Brokaw Attacks Clinton from Left</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 16, 1996
<p>
One item today: Tom Brokaw challenges President Clinton from
the left in the premiere of "Internight," the 8pm ET interviewshow on the new MSNBC cable network.
<p>
Here are two questions posed by Brokaw in his live July 15 interview:
<p>
    > Brokaw: "Let's talk for a moment about welfare. The
Republicans have a bill that they think you will sign, on the
Hill. It eliminates the federal guarantee of cash assistance for
poor children in this country, a guarantee that we've had in
place since the early 1930s. Are you prepared to have that
happen?"
<p>
    Clinton: "Depends on what else is in the bill."
<p>
    Brokaw: "But you can foresee the possibility that we'll take
away the ultimate safety net of no federal cash assistance to
very poor children?"
<p>
And a couple of segments later:
<p>
    Brokaw: "Mr. President, before we get back to the internet
questions, I wanted to follow up just for a moment on welfare if
I can. If in fact you sign the Republican bill that's likely to
come down from the Hill, all the projections show that that will
push, at least short term, more than a million youngsters in this
country below the poverty line. That's a high risk for youngsters
in this country who are already in peril."

Another network, another pile of bias to document. -- Brent

<h3>Chancellor Reality Check</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 14, 1996
<p>
One item in this MRC Alert: 
<p>
> John Chancellor is being praised for his fairness, but a reviewof his commentaries show he used his position to promote liberalideas and attack conservatives.
<p>
As you may know, NBC News veteran John Chancellor passed away
at age 68 on Friday evening. From 1970 to 1982 he anchored the
NBC Nightly News, then provided commentary through 1993. During
the Johnson Administration he presided over the Voice of America.
His passing has generated a series of tributes to his
fairness and impartiality from his media colleagues. On the July
13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams
observed: "He was a role model for all who care about truth,
justice and fairness. John Chancellor died last night of cancer,
two days short of his 69th birthday. He helped define what TV
news should be."
<p>
Let's take a look at the views expressed in some of his
Nightly News commentaries in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
<p>
    -- April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans,
federal, state, and local, is actually quite low....The fact is
Americans could pay more taxes and the country wouldn't go down
the tube. Taxpayers don't believe this because they are being
conned by the politicians...The truth is that the United States
needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders
are now starting to say that, but until more say it, the country
will remain in trouble."
<p>
    -- August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap,
so there are lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so
women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home
in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody even talked
about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
<p>
    -- March 12, 1992: "Greenpeace, the public interest
organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000.
Allied military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The
disparity is huge and somewhat embarrassing. And that's
commentary for this evening, Tom." 
<p>
    -- Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican
convention: "I think that the convention -- and certainly all the
polling data indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in the country who thought it was too religious
and too hard-edged." 
<p>
    -- February 16, 1993: "There is no mystery in how [the
deficit] can be brought down...the U.S. simply has to choose from
a menu of unpalatable options that include deeper cuts in defense
spending, tougher controls on medical services, higher taxes on
federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption,
preferably both. We know how to do this. Impose measures already
commonplace in other industrialized countries. The weapons are
there. It's the will to use them that's the problem."
<p>
    -- April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots: "It's not a
big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the
white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in
downtown Los Angeles rioted and people died....Politicians have
fanned these flames with code words about `welfare queens,'
`equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language designed to turn
whites against blacks. With two-party politics that favored the
rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
    -- November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold
War by spending so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt
trying to keep up. That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency
the United States itself became a bankrupt country."
<p>
    -- November 7, 1990: "The fact is that most government
spending cannot be cut. The way out of the mess is for the
government to raise some money through taxes and at last that's
being done. And there's encouraging news in the returns from
yesterday's elections. Six states from Massachusetts to
California rejected measures designed to limit taxation. Can it
be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is coming to an end? If
true, maybe the country can get on with the business of balancing
its books in a sensible and logical way." 
<p>
    -- June 20, 1989: "Thousands may have been gunned down in
Beijing, but what about the millions of American kids whose lives
are being ruined by an enormous failure of the country's
educational system...We can and we should agonize about the dead
students in Beijing, but we've got a much bigger problem here at
home."
<p>
    -- Finally, here's the July 1990 MediaWatch newsbite on
Chancellor's 1990 book. He's no fan of Ronald Reagan:
<p>
Once anchor of NBC Nightly News, John Chancellor now offers his
opinions thrice weekly. His commentaries have recently been
distilled into a book on what's wrong with America, Peril and
Promise.
<p>
So what's wrong? The deficit, which he attributed to a Reagan
recipe of "big tax cuts, big increases in defense spending, and a
hair curling recession." Pardoned from blame: congressional mismanagement. And though federal revenues went up swiftly in the
'80s, Chancellor remembered only that "cuts in taxes and domestic
spending resulted in the first redistribution of income in favor
of the affluent since the 1920s and a reduction of the federal
government's obligation to the poor." Another Reagan error was
the Grenada liberation which Chancellor called "a sham triumph,"
a "tragicomedy," which "might not have been necessary."
<p>
Chancellor harped on America's faults for 130 pages, but
dedicated fewer than 40 pages to suggesting solutions. He called
his remedies to America's woes neither conservative nor liberal,
yet higher taxes remained the pillar of his plan. Another major
objective: mobilization of a national corps of volunteers because
"The poor and disadvantaged need help, especially after the
cutbacks in social services during the Reagan years."
<p>
I'll be sending another e-mail late tonight with some more
recent bias from Sam Donaldson and coverage of Dole and the
NAACP. -- Brent Baker

<p>
<h3>More Hate Radio; Dole Fuels "Racial Divides"</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 12, 1996 
<p>
Four items today:
<ul>
<li>A Time magazine reporter attributes the First Lady's problems
not to any wrongdoing but to the fact that "Mrs. Clinton has
changed the role of First Lady."
<li>Eleanor Clift charges that the evil "right-wing mafia" are
fueling "hate radio."
<li>Newsweek's Joe Klein finds a bright spot in the public's lack
of concern over controversies dogging the Clintons: It may lead
to the end of such distracting scandal-mongering. 
<li>NBC portrays Bob Dole's lack of appearance at the NAACP
convention as "an insult to African-American voters" which "may
reinforce...racial divides along party lines."
<p>
> 1) This quote was picked up by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen fromthe June 28 Washington Week in Review. Time magazine Washingtonreporter Michael Duffy thinks the First Lady is surrounded bycontroversy because she's doing so much more: "I also think thatMrs. Clinton has changed the role of First Lady so much, youknow, by getting so involved and so active and paid such a highprice for it."
<p>
> 2) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday July 1,
Eleanor Clift offered this explanation as to who is to blame for 
the Gary Aldrich book: "One thing we haven't really mentioned is
the people who are surrounding Mr. Aldrich and in fact they are
members of what I would call the right-wing mafia. I mean they
were there for Paula Jones and they are fueling a lot of what we
hear on hate radio." MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens found thatquote.
<p>
> 3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this conclusion to
Newsweek Senior Editor Joe Klein's July 8 piece on filegate: "But
if Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the `-gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most
memorable public service." 
<p>
    Funny how he didn't feel that way until the scandals hit a
Democratic President.
<p>
    > 4) After summarizing Bill Clinton's attack on Dole over the
assault weapons ban, on the July 10 NBC Nightly News reporter Jim
Miklaszewski proceeded to review the controversy over Bob Dole
not addressing the NAACP convention. Here's the last two-thirds
of his Wednesday night story as transcribed by MRC intern Jessica Anderson:
<p>
Miklaszewski: "No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as
no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak to the
convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already
committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball game. To those
at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<p>
[Woman at NAACP convention: "When you want to be President of the
United States of America, you cannot afford to write any American
off."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Back in Washington, Dole's Democratic critics had
a field day."
<p>
[Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D) Michigan: "He's saying, 'I don't
care about the black vote in November,' and I think that the
black vote in November will not care about him."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "That already appears to be the case. The latest
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton has a lock on the
African-American vote; only five percent would vote for Bob Dole.
[On-screen visual shows Clinton with 87 percent and Dole with
five percent, plus or minus seven percentage points.] But even
Colin Powell believes that Dole should have made an appearance."
<p>
[Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.): "I wish he didn't have a scheduling
conflict. I think it would have been useful for him to present
his views to the NAACP."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "It would have been a tough crowd."
<p>
[Anonymous man: "I think he made the right move he didn't come
because perhaps he might get booed."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Nevertheless, by not showing up here, Bob Dole may
reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the
anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign
Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC
News, Charlotte."
<p>
So, when Bill Clinton fails to address a Christian Coalition
convention that's an insult to all Christians? -- Brent Baker

<p>
<h3>Taxes vs. Cuts; Carlson Hypocrisy; NBC's Victims</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 11, 1996
<p>
<b>Four items today:</b>
<ul>
<li>Some real bias in Katie Couric's interview with Bob Dole that
got lost in the publicity over smoking. She sees tax cuts and
budget balancing as contradictory.
<li>Time magazine's Margaret Carlson blasts her industry for
publicizing the Gary Aldrich book, but a bit of hypocrisy comes
through when you look at an article she wrote in 1985.
<li>NBC Nightly News discovers and cries over a new class of
"victims" -- those who don't get paid for overtime.
<li>Asked to rate the media's bias from right to left on a scale
of 0 to ten, Eleanor Clift puts the media right in the middle.
</ul>
> 1) The now famous Today exchange about smoking took place
in part two of a three part interview. On the first day, July 1,
Katie Couric displayed the conventional media wisdom about tax
cuts and balancing the budget: you can have one but not the
other. Here are her challenges to Bob Dole as he tries to explain
how he'll achieve both:<br>
    -- "So you don't support across the board tax cuts?"<br>
    -- "What's more important to you, tax cuts or balancing the
budget, if you had to choose?"<br>
    -- "If you had to pick one?"
<p>
     > 2) Margaret Carlson opened her July 15 Time column on
attention to the Gary Aldrich book by charging that "the press
has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for the
truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it." In her
last paragraph, she wrote: "There was a time when by common
agreement a book like Aldrich's would die for lack of oxygen. Now
the mainstream media strive to get every sensational rumor 'in
play.'"
<p>    
Well, as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham reminded me,
let's flip through Carlson's clip book. The July 1989 MediaWatch
quoted this paragraph from Carlson's November 1985 article in
Esquire magazine previewing the 1988 Republican contenders:
<p>
"What one does in Washington behind closed doors generally
stays out of the paper. But the persistent rumor that one of the
potential 1988 presidential candidates has a homosexual past is
testing the unacknowledged code of silence among reporters."
<p>
   > 3) On Tuesday night (July 9), the day the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase bill, Tom Brokaw announced that "the Labor
Department has discovered that millions of American workers are
being shortchanged on another front: overtime. They're working it, but they're not getting the dividend." As transcribed by MRC
intern Jessica Anderson, here are some excerpts from the story
that should have generated little sympathy from those with
salaried jobs.
<p>   
Reporter Mike Jensen began by talking with Becky Perkins who
"raises two children and works long hours as a parole officer in
Texas." She explained: "There's no way you can leave at 5:00. I
mean, you're staying there 'til six, seven, eight, doing just
paperwork alone, not to mention going out into the field to make
home visits."
<p>   
But, Jensen reported, "In spite of the long hours, the state
refused to pay Becky overtime, but the U.S. Labor Department
investigated. It said money was owed, that Becky had been
shortchanged....Workers like Becky are gypped out of an estimated
$20 billion a year in unpaid overtime. The worst offenders?
Construction companies, garment factories, toy makers, auto
repair shops, and food stores. Hundreds of thousands of victims
and very few complaints, says attorney Joan Keyok" [spelling
approximated].
<p>    
Following a soundbite from her, Jensen returned to the
"victim" theme: "Many of the victims are minimum wage workers
afraid of being fired, or immigrants who don't know their rights,
or older workers concerned about downsizing. They never see the
time and a half pay that's legally theirs."
<p>
    > 4) On a 0-10 scale of media bias from right wing to left
wing bias where does Eleanor Clift place the media? Here's her
answer from McLaughlin Group last weekend: "The press is right in
the middle. It's a five. The bias is for bad news."
<p>
    Another sign of progress: Not even a committed liberal like
Clift dares to say anymore that the media are biased to the
right. -- Brent Baker

<Title>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many in the media have accepted, and passed on as fact, the Democrats' party line that Republicans were out to cut and even destroy Medicare. CNN's Frank Sesno, on the December 17 Late Edition, set the record straight.
<p>
He first interviewed President Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin. Sesno confronted Rivlin with the facts: "Take Medicare, for example. You said, the President, rather, yesterday said, `They would let Medicare wither on the vine into a second class citizen.' Now, you don't really believe that the Republicans are going to let Medicare wither on the vine? They're not talking about that. And as you well know, and as they say as many times as they are able, even with their cuts in the rate of growth of the program, it still grows into an ever larger piece of the pie."
<p>
When Rivlin balked at such an analysis, Sesno remained adamant. "In the interest of truth in advertising here, do you really believe that the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate want to destroy Medicare?" he asked. "Isn't this part of the Mediscare debate that your critics accuse you of engaging in?"
<p>
After Rivlin, Sesno interviewed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (along with GOP Senator Trent Lott). He pointed out to Daschle that "in the health care reform debate, of not very long ago, of which you were a part, there was a great deal of talk that expenses had to be controlled. You had something called global budgeting. I mean you were going to hold everybody down. So why is it unfair to do that in the case of Medicare?"
<p>
Later, when Senator Daschle called the Republican plan to slow Medicare's growth "the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare. Biggest by far. Three times more than has ever been proposed." Sesno corrected him: "Biggest cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, not absolute cuts."
<p>
Kudos to Sesno for giving Democratic rhetoric the same scrutiny reporters usually reserve for Republicans.

<Title>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</h2>
<p>
<h3>Donations Rise as Funding Threatened</h3>
</center>
<p>
At this time last year, leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Television (PTV), and National Public Radio (NPR) were calling their viewers and listeners stingy. Not in so many words, of course, but that was in effect their argument when they warned that they would not be able to make up any cut in or elimination of public broadcasting's federal subsidy.
Conservatives, looking at history, argued that when taxes were cut (as Republicans planned), people gave more to organizations they support, including public broadcasting, and that if people truly liked public broadcasting, they would not let it die.
<p>
<b>Who was right?</b><br>
Looking at the results of last year's public broadcasting pledge drives, as reported in the Public Broadcasting Report, it looks like conservatives were correct. Even without a tax cut, merely the threat of cutting public broadcasting's subsidy spurred massive increases in private donations early in the year. Later, when it was clear that the federal subsidy would be kept, donations began to level off.
<p>
Conservatives, in making their arguments, were standing on strong historical ground. During the 1980s, when tax rates were cut, individual donations to public television, for example, increased every year. In fiscal year 1980 there were 2.6 million members of PTV who gave an average contribution of $29.96 for a total of almost $78 million. By fiscal year 1989 the number of members had doubled (to 5.2 million) and the average contribution had increased steadily (to $50.38), giving public television a total of $262 million from individual members. In fiscal year 1991, after the Bush tax increase, the number of individual public television members dropped to 5.07 million.
<p>
Last year, when Republicans in Congress threatened to eliminate or substantially cut public broadcasting's federal subsidy, donations skyrocketed. The first bit of good news came in February. KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, California announced that it had set a record for on-air fundraising by a public radio station in its February 6-14 winter subscription drive. According to the Public Broadcasting Report (PBR), the station "raised $1.09 million from 14,314 new and renewing subscribers," a 26 percent increase over the previous year. General manager Ruth Seymour told PBR that the debate over federal funding spurred the massive increase: "I think our audience understands that we are committed to the effort to keep public radio noncommercial."
<p>
Then public television stations began to note a striking increase in donations. PBR told its readers on March 24 that "PTV stations across the country reported very successful spring pledge drives." The Arkansas Educational Television Network, for example surpassed its $350,000 goal despite reducing the time spent in pledge breaks by ten percent. KRMA-TV in Denver and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. had record-breaking drives, with KRMA reporting a 13 percent increase over 1994 totals and WETA garnering almost $1 million from 12,600 pledges, 62 percent of which were from new members. KCET in Los Angeles finished its spring pledge drive with $1.68 million, exceeding its March, 1994 drive, which lasted three days longer, by $205,127.
<p>
Nationwide, PBR reported, the number of pledges for March were "12.9 percent above March 1994 returns" and the total dollars pledged were up 15.3 percent. Public radio had similar success. According to PBR, "on average, stations did 15-40 percent better during this drive than they did during last year's campaign." The public radio stations that did "only" 15-20 percent better than the previous year were "those who stopped once they reached their goals."
<p>
The momentum was sustained through the summer. PBR reported on August 25 that "indications are that the August PTV pledge drive will be another hit in a year of overwhelmingly successful campaigns that many have attributed to publicity involving projected federal budget cuts." The number of pledges had increased a dramatic 18 percent over the previous August and pledge dollars were up 16 percent.
<p>
By December, though, when it had become clear that Republicans were not going to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, or even cut it substantially, pledge growth slowed. The December pledge drive, according to PBR, collected seven percent more than the December 1994 pledge drive, a healthy increase, but not at the level of the astronomical increases of March and August.
<p>
The moral of the story: Viewers value public broadcasting enough to increase their donations when federal funding is threatened. But when it's clear the government will pay for it, they don't feel the need to pay as much.
<p>
This should reassure public broadcasting executives. During last year's debate, they didn't express much confidence in their supporters. CPB Chairman Henry Cauthen predicted that if federal funding were foregone, 87 public television stations would have to be closed down. (He didn't point out, of course that this would still give PBS more television stations than ABC, CBS, or NBC.)
Public Broadcasting Service president Ervin S. Duggan told TV Guide: "I don't think public TV could survive and maintain its mandate without federal funding. Survival would come at a cost of becoming commercial. We'd be driven by ratings, not quality."
<p>
As the debate continued Duggan became so convinced that individuals wouldn't ante up support for a privatized PBS that he began to speak in harsh tones about the future of the network, comparing privatized television to prostitution. He worried that "commercialized public television is likely to resemble, for all the world, Thomas Hardy's ruined maid: `no longer pure and simple, brazenly working the streets in her new commercial finery, doing whatever necessary to survive.'"
<p>
The evidence suggests Cauthen and Duggan were wrong. When federal funding decreases, private funding increases. If members of Congress really want to strengthen public broadcasting, then they should wean it from the federal government and cut taxes.

<center><h2>Focus on Fortune 500 misses real trends</h2>
<p>
<h3>Lamenting Layoffs, Ignoring Job Rise</h3>
</center>
<p>
The current wave of layoffs at several large companies seems to confirm in many reporters' minds their view of how the business world works: Corporate America racks up record profits for wealthy shareholders while laying off millions of workers.
<p>
That's how the networks have reported the layoffs. But with a little digging these reporters could have found that corporate profits are not unusually high, that shareholders are not just rich people, and that more jobs are being created than destroyed.
<p>
Anchor John Roberts set the tone of the layoff coverage on the December 26 CBS Evening News: "The market has been hitting one record high after another. But as Economics Correspondent Ray Brady reports, many workers have paid a heavy price." Brady then interviewed "ex-Wall Streeter" Michael Thomas, who told viewers what he seemed to think was shocking: "Executives are running companies exclusively for their stockholders."
<p>
This focus on the interests of stockholders, Brady explained, has meant layoffs at such established companies as 3M and AT&T, which caused their stock prices to jump. "Who pays the price for this stock market prosperity?" Brady asked. "Come to any job center, where laid off middle managers scramble desperately for work. Corporate America announced more than 41,000 layoffs last month alone, up 45 percent over the same month a year ago."
<p>
Martha Teichner, Brady's colleague at CBS, joined the chorus on the January 7 Sunday Morning. "For all of 1995, the figure was nearly 450,000, but, hey, that's the good news. In 1993 it was 615,000," Teichner reported. "Here's a statistic for our leaner and meaner times. Since 1980, Fortune 500 companies, America's biggest and most profitable corporations, announced layoffs of more than eight million people. That's like laying off the entire population of New York City."
<p>
Over at NBC, on the January 4 Nightly News, Mike Jensen agreed. After saying that some companies had to downsize in order to survive, he said, "Some companies simply decided to make more money by firing people. Corporate profits totalled about $400 billion last year, up 25 percent. What all those companies did was obliterate one of the keystones of the American Dream, the security of a job for life. They created anxiety for everyone, even those who didn't get fired."
<p>
But just how high are corporate profits? According to the January 4 Investor's Business Daily, which quoted a study by the Employment Policy Foundation, corporate "profits have dropped from an average of 12 percent of national output in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s to about 9 percent currently -- a decline of about 25 percent in profits' share of total output."
<p>
About those supposedly greedy stockholders, the newspaper pointed out that they may not be who viewers were led to believe they were: "With more than half of all Americans now owning stocks through retirement, mutual, and individual shareholder accounts, it is the average American who benefits most from corporate profits -- not some fat cat on Wall Street."
<p>
And here's a statistic for Teichner: "Little noticed among the repeated headlines of Fortune 500 firms cutting jobs are the literally thousands of small and medium-sized firms that are adding new workers at a frenetic pace. Since the start of 1994, more than five million new jobs have been created in the U.S. economy -- more than enough to sop up all the new entrants in the work force."
<p>
Reporters seem to think the entire business world begins and ends with the Fortune 500. Until they start looking at the entire economy, they won't be able to tell the entire story.

<CENTER><H3>A Flat Tax Fact Sheet</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Virtually every Republican presidential candidate has endorsed some version of 
the flat tax, as has the Kemp Tax Reform Commission. This support is mirrored 
by public opinion, with polls showing anywhere between one-half and two-thirds 
of taxpayers prefer the flat tax over the current system. Needless to say, with 
all this attention, it comes as no surprise that many in the media have begun 
writing about and describing this revolutionary proposal. Unfortunately, this 
new-found publicity has been accompanied by frequent errors. In order to 
maintain accuracy, reporters should avoid these two most common mistakes:
<P>
Mistake #1: Many reporters write that the flat tax contains a huge loophole for 
the rich because they have trouble understanding how income is taxed under a 
flat tax. This error shows up in several ways. Some report that dividend and 
interest income is tax free. Others write that only labor income is taxed.
<P>
Reality: The source of these common mistakes is that the most well-known 
versions of the flat tax collect taxes on capital income at the source. Under 
the Armey- Shelby flat tax, for instance, a corporation must pay tax on behalf 
of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends. This 
approach, which reduces administrative costs and ensures greater compliance, 
makes a dividend check similar to a worker's paycheck in that both are 
after-tax payments. The same is true for interest income. Under the flat tax, 
businesses and financial institutions pay tax on interest payments they make, 
so there is no need to collect the tax a second time at the individual level. 
Once again, the motive for taking this approach is simplicity and compliance.
<P>
Message: Reporters can argue that the tax should be collected at the individual 
level. They can even argue that the income should be subjected to two or more 
layers of tax. Honesty demands, however, that they acknowledge that all income 
is taxed with a flat tax, but only taxed once, and that tax is collected in the 
least costly fashion possible.
<P>
Mistake #2: The flat tax will increase the deficit and/or boost taxes on the 
middle class. Many news reports assume that a flat tax will require a tax rate 
of 21 percent or more to offset reductions in excessive tax rates on the rich. 
Even with the generous personal allowance, this tax rate would adversely affect 
the middle class. Failure to levy a rate that high, on the other hand, would 
cause larger deficits.
<P>
Reality: With a 17 percent rate, the Armey-Shelby flat tax explicitly is 
designed to reduce the amount of money the government collects. As a result, 
even without making any assumptions about faster economic growth expanding the 
tax base (the supply-side effect), it is possible for all income classes to 
enjoy a lower tax burden. With regards to the deficit, the plan imposes strict 
new limits on government spending. Enforced by automatic spending control 
mechanisms, this ensures that the deficit will not climb. The key principle is 
that the flat tax is accompanied by spending savings to keep the overall 
package deficit-neutral.
<P>
Message: Conclusions that the middle class is harmed are based on analysis of a 
revenue-neutral tax proposal which does not exist. Reporters can condemn the 
proposal for reducing the amount of money the government collects, and they can 
write that the growth of government would have to be significantly slowed to 
keep the plan deficit neutral as sponsors propose, but it is inaccurate to 
assert that the middle class will pay more or that the deficit will increase.
<P>
With help from biased sources such as the Clinton Treasury Department and the 
union-funded Citizens for Tax Justice, many reporters have unwittingly (we 
hope) made one of these mistakes. Some, like Al Hunt of  The Wall Street 
Journal and Ann Reilly Dowd of Money, have made both mistakes in the same 
article. Fair and accurate reporting depends on the public receiving 
information in a straight- forward fashion. Avoiding these two mistakes will 
help ensure the upcoming tax debate is marked by legitimate policy issues 
rather than distorted media messages.

<h3>Reporters Crash, Viewers Burned</h3>
</center>
<p>
Just when you think reporters couldn't get any more hostile to industry, they do. Consider two mid-January television reports on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Both stories contain mistakes which often plague reports about automobile safety, and both ignored the trade-offs safety regulations inevitably require. 
<p>
At issue were federal standards for rear guards on tractor trailers. These "U"-shaped metal rods are specifically intended to keep cars that hit the rear of a truck from riding under it. The regulatory standard for the guards has been set at 30 inches from the ground for the past fifty years, although the voluntary industry standard has been 22 inches for several years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) merely codified this standard with the cooperation of the trucking industry.
<p>
That's the news part. But reporters portrayed this issue as a grand conflict, with industry as a hostile force and supposedly-impartial "consumer advocates" as society's protectors. The question for reporters was how to criticize industry without panning the government in a situation where both agreed. Here's how they answered it:
<p>
Neither report mentioned that industry was already producing 22-inch guards. ABC's Lisa Stark, on the January 19 Good Morning America, reported that "under the new standard, rear guards...must be lowered to 22 inches above the ground. They're now at 30 inches." Tom Brokaw stated in his introduction to the January 17 NBC Nightly News segment, "The government is about to take an action that should save lives." Robert Hager was more explicit in the NBC segment, saying that the government will require new tractor trailers "to be made with big rods on the back, bigger than any currently in use."
Neither report pointed out that most tractor trailers already have the 22-inch guards -- voluntarily.
<p>
Hager employed questionable data. "Nearly 700 [people] a year die in [ride-under] accidents," he declared. But both NHTSA and the trucking industry put the number of deaths at 60 each year. (ABC's Lisa Stark used the NHTSA figure.)
<p>
Both reports projected skepticism of the new standard -- but not of the government -- as insufficiently stringent without offering evidence. In Stark's report, Gerald Donaldson of Citizens for Reliable & Safe Highways (CRASH) stated that the new rule "was not selected on the basis of what would really be a big contribution to improving public safety... [but] on the basis of what the trucking industry would buy into."
<p>
The ubiquitous Joan Claybrook, representing CRASH in Hager's report, said, "We don't think this rule makes significant enough changes....Very few people are going to be protected under this standard." Hager didn't ask Claybrook why, if she was so concerned, she never acted on the rear guard issue when she was head of NHTSA from 1977-1981.
<p>
Neither report was skeptical of these supposedly objective "consumer advocates." The media look at funding only when it comes to industry associations or conservative advocates. That's why we hear about "tobacco-funded groups," but not "trial-lawyer-funded groups." The fact that a group is funded by parties who have a stake in certain outcomes does not necessarily mean that what they say is incorrect. Still, it would have been interesting if the reporters had asked who funds CRASH; they would have discovered that CRASH is substantially funded by the railroad industry.
<p>
Regulations intended to increase safety by decreasing one risk often backfire by creating new risks. For example, the risk of keeping the rear guard at 22 inches means that some small cars could still slip under the truck. But making the rear guard lower means that trucks could get caught on railroad grade crossings or have difficulty maneuvering around rail yards and ports, causing different kinds of accidents. ABC touched on this issue dismissively; NBC only mentioned the dollar cost of the changes.
<p>
When it comes to government regulation of safety, even the most skeptical reporters become true believers. Too eager to criticize industry, and too receptive to "consumer groups" which invariably advocate more government regulation, reporters often believe that we can have more safety at no cost. But overlooking the trade-offs involved in government regulation does not help anyone, and could, in fact, be deadly. Who pays this price? The very people reporters are trying to inform: consumers.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</Title>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</h2>
<p>
<h3>A Bumpy Road for the Flat Tax</h3>
</center>
<p>
The newest rage on the political scene is the flat tax. It has propelled the presidential candidacy of Republican Steve Forbes, causing most of the other GOP candidates to formulate a version of their own. The flat tax is a simple tax system with complex arguments both for it and against it. Covering such an issue is, therefore, a difficult task. To be fair and balanced, reporters at the very least must present the best arguments for it and against it. But so far, the best arguments for the flat tax have rarely made the news.
<p>
Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the flat-tax stories on network evening news shows (ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News) and in national news magazines (Newsweek, Time, U.S. News & World Report) during the month of January. There were 16 stories which presented arguments for or against the flat tax. (There were more about the Forbes campaign generally.) In those 16 stories, arguments against the flat tax were presented 51 times, while arguments in favor of the flat tax were presented only 24 times.
<p>
Double Taxation. The argument against the flat tax most often presented -- 24 times in the 16 stories -- was that it would not tax interest income or investment income, and thus overly benefit the wealthy. For example, ABC's Dean Reynolds, on the January 29 World News Tonight, said the Forbes flat tax would mean "no taxes on inherited wealth or stock portfolios." Newsweek's Marc Levinson and Rich Thomas contended that "investment income would be tax-free." According to Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "There would be no capital gains tax, no tax on interest earned at the bank, or for money you've made through investments. A millionaire living solely on dividends or inherited money wouldn't have to pay any tax."
<p>
Only twice did a reporter point out that such a millionaire, under a flat tax, would in fact be taxed. Flat-tax proponents argue that investment income would indeed be taxed, but only at the corporate or bank level. As the Heritage Foundation's Dan Mitchell wrote in the January MediaNomics, under the flat tax "a corporation must pay tax on behalf of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends." Flat-tax proponents argue that, as in the case of withholding, savers and investors currently get less money because it has already been taxed, but still must pay an additional income tax on the money. Only Newsweek's Allan Sloan, in an anti-flat tax article, pointed out that currently "some [income], like corporate dividends, is in effect taxed twice."
<p>
Mortgage Interest. The next most common argument against the flat tax was that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would hurt the middle class. Reporters cited such arguments 13 times in the 16 stories. According to the January 15 U.S. News & World Report, "Homeowners could see home values drop if mortgage interest payments and property taxes were no longer deductible." On the January 15 World News Tonight, Peter Jennings weighed in on the issue by only mentioning one side: "President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction."
<p>
Reporters mentioned counterarguments to such claims only three times. For instance, Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, said, "Forbes counters those arguments by saying the deduction won't be needed because homeowners will pay less in taxes, which will cause the economy to grow, which will cause interest rates overall to go down." No reporter mentioned that the deduction is actually regressive. John Berthoud of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution pointed out in the January 31 Investor's Business Daily that "80 percent of the break's tax benefits go to those with incomes over $50,000."
<p>
Federal Deficit. Twelve times reporters cited the claim of flat-tax opponents that the flat tax would greatly increase the federal deficit. NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 17 Nightly News, claimed that "the biggest loser would be the government. With a 17-percent flat tax, critics say the budget deficit could double." According to Jensen: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent."
<p>
Echoing Jensen, ABC's John Cochran, on the January 19 World News Tonight, said that "Forbes' opponents still say his version of the flat tax won't work, that it would increase the budget deficit at a time when Republicans are trying to eliminate it." U.S. News & World Report agreed: "The Treasury Department estimates that a flat-tax rate would need to be set at 21 percent -- not 17 percent -- to raise the same level of revenues as the current income-tax system does. Without raising this rate, the federal government would see its budget deficit rise, and this would add to Washington's fiscal woes."
<p>
Only half as many times -- six -- did reporters give the counterargument that the flat tax would not increase the federal deficit. Time's Dan Goodgame, for example, wrote that Forbes "assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit." Goodgame, though, dismissed such a belief as a "quasi-theology."
<p>
Noting that Forbes' 17 percent rate might be a revenue-loser for the government, some reporters wondered how Forbes would make up the shortfall. Newsweek's Allen Sloan asked: "How will he fill the gap? With economic growth and spending cuts. Details? Forbes isn't saying." Time's Goodgame criticized Forbes because he "declines to specify spending he would cut." It's true that Forbes has not been specific about spending cuts. But then reporters rarely give such reprimands to politicians who oppose slowing entitlement growth, but decline to specify how much taxes will then have to increase. Why the double standard for Forbes?
<p>
Charitable Contributions. Twice reporters mentioned the argument that a flat tax would hurt charities by removing the deduction for charitable contributions. According to ABC's Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "Charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible." The January 15 U.S. News & World Report similarly warned that "charities could lose donations if contributions were no longer deductible."
<p>
No reporter mentioned the counterargument that charities would not be hurt by a flat tax. John Berthoud's Investor's Business Daily article points out that "of $117 billion donated [to charities] in 1991, $56 billion came from non-itemizers. Of the $61 billion that was deducted, 54 percent came from Americans in low-to-moderate tax brackets. Thus, three of four dollars given to charity don't lead to a substantial tax benefit." Berthoud further noted that "top marginal tax rates dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988, thus robbing the deduction of more than half its value. And the deduction for non-itemizers was eliminated in 1986. Yet charitable contributions rose" at a record pace.
<p>
Flat Tax Favorables. Only two arguments in favor of the flat tax -- its simplicity and its closing of loopholes -- were reported thoroughly. Seven times reporters made the case that the flat tax would make the tax code simpler. CBS's Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, pointed out "the simplicity of the plan. No accountants needed to tell you what you owe. No long forms to fill out." Six times reporters pointed out that the flat tax would close loopholes for special interests. Joe Klein, for instance, on the January 21 CBS Evening News, said: "[Forbes'] is a anti-Washington campaign, and that's how he sells the flat tax. He says, `I'll eliminate a whole lobbying industry, the industry that gets tax loopholes for special interests.' And that's the advantage of the flat tax."
<p>
But those were the exceptions. Most of the time arguments against the flat tax were presented without arguments in its favor meriting a mention. At times reporters, such as Newsweek's Allan Sloan, didn't try to hide their fondness for the politics of envy: "Taxing investment income at both the corporate and personal levels, as it's taxed now, may not be sound economics. But it's reasonably sound social policy, considering that most investment income flows to upper-income people." Sloan didn't mention that many investments, such as those in pension funds and mutual funds, are made by the middle class. 
<p>
At other times the opposition to the flat tax became absurd. NBC's Mike Jensen managed to find a middle class couple who claimed that the $3,146 tax cut they would get under the Forbes plan "is really not going to change our lives."
For such a simple policy, the arguments over the flat tax are quite complicated. Still, reporters should not bring up the arguments of flat-tax opponents unless they're willing to give flat-tax supporters a chance to respond.

<Title>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</Title>
</Head>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</h2>
<p>
<h3>ABC's Missing Campaign Reform Idea</h3>
</center>
<p>
Is there too much money in politics? That question is a rhetorical one for much of the media. They simply assume that there is. So far this campaign season, network newscasts have reported numerous times about the costs of running a presidential campaign and the alleged problems this raises for candidates. Because reporters assume private money hurts politics, they report on every reform option except the one conservatives champion -- raising (or eliminating) the limits on individual donations to candidates.
<p>
Case in point: ABC News. On January 17 and 18 ABC's World News Tonight devoted a total of five stories to the role of money in the presidential campaign, under the title "The Greenback Primary." These stories followed a January 15 Nightline broadcast about campaign-finance reform. The assumption in all of these stories was that money has -- as Peter Jennings put it -- a "corrosive effect" on the political process.
<p>
Various correspondents contributed to the World News Tonight series. Jim Wooten pointed out that front-loaded primaries meant candidates have to raise a lot of money early. "None of the Republicans except Senator Dole has actually reached his fundraising goal," Wooten reported. "He's ahead. There could be a connection." John Donvan illustrated the elaborate means candidates must employ to raise enough money to compete. Bill Blakemore noted the rise of "soft money," such as contributions to political parties and independ-ent expenditures. According to Blakemore: "It's how corporations and unions can snub the law that forbids them to give to presidential campaigns."
<p>
While many of these stories were informative, none questioned the common wisdom that too much money is the problem with the current campaign finance system. None cited the mainstream conservative argument, made by law professor Bradley Smith in a Cato Institute study, that more money would improve politics. Smith wrote: "Considering the importance of elections to any democratic society, it is hard to believe that the expenditure of less than $10 per voter for all local, state, and national campaigns constitutes a crisis requiring government regulation and limitations on spending."
<p>
Ignoring this argument led to biased coverage of possible reforms. On the January 15 Nightline, Jeff Greenfield reported, "We'll be hearing a torrent of words about campaign-finance reform this year, but every proposal for change raises some big questions. Complete public financing? Well, skeptical voters might see that as just another taxpayer rip-off. Force television stations to provide free air time? Who would qualify and who wouldn't? Say to multi-millionaires they can't spend as much as they want on their own campaigns? No, the Supreme Court says that would be unconstitutional."
<p>
While Greenfield skillfully raised objections to all the reform ideas he cited, he didn't mention "every proposal for change." David Frum, in the January 15 Weekly Standard, suggested one proposal conservatives have long advocated -- "a sharp increase in the maximum permissible personal donation." Frum argued that "if [candidates] could raise their money in bigger chunks, they could spend much less time at the task" and that "once large donations could be made directly to the candidate -- which every candidate prefers -- the evil of unaccountable and undisclosed soft money would tend to wither away."
<p>
Reporters are correct to sense that something is wrong with the campaign-finance system. And the liberal view that private money always corrupts political campaigns should be reported fairly. But journalists shouldn't assume liberals are right and report liberal reform plans as if they were the only ones being proposed.

<title>Reporters Don't Challenge Politicians on Anti-Green Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on Government Pollution</h2>
</center>
<p>
When the media report on the environment, which will no doubt be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, they almost always employ the same formula. Private industry is portrayed as the cause of all environmental problems; government is portrayed as the protector of the public. This formula ignores one big cause of environ- mental problems -- federal agriculture subsidies, which not only hurt taxpayers and consumers, but also finance environmental destruction.
<p>
Example: recent coverage of the Clinton Administration's proposal to try to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. Most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton plan, which would increase the tax on sugar by a penny per pound to pay for a $1.5 billion program that includes the federal government buying and restoring land in the Everglades.
<p>
According to CBS This Morning's Jane Robelot, on February 20, "The Clinton Administration has announced ambitious plans to save the Everglades from further ecological destruction by raising the tax on sugar." Correspondent Art Rascon continued: "It's the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever."
<p>
Newsweek's Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 issue, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar  money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times wrote on February 20 that "the administration's seven-year plan to save one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States is as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years, environmentalists say."
<p>
And according to ABC's Barry Serafin, on the February 19 World News Tonight, "Administration officials say the [sugar] industry, which enjoys generous price supports must pay its fair share, a view shared by many in South Florida, who are determined to bring back the state's fabled river of grass."
<p>
Although none of these reporters were wrong, and a few even pointed out the huge federal subsidy sugar gets from high tariffs, none asked why the government shouldn't simply stop subsidizing sugar. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jonathan Tolman told MediaNomics that if the government simply "brought down the tariff wall on sugar, it would discourage overfarming of sugar near the Everglades and make land there less expensive, which would make Gore's program to buy the land less expensive." In addition, no reporter brought up another point Tolman makes: "The Clinton tax increase on sugar will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
<p>
Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times, in a February 29 article about price supports, made the connection between the government subsidies and environmental damage. Schmitt pointed out that "under the sugar program...the government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year. Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
But Schmitt was the exception among national reporters. Most reporters chose to challenge neither Clinton nor Republicans on why they maintain a subsidy that hurts consumers, taxpayers, and the environment.

<center><h2>Media Lay Off New Jobs Story</h2>
</center>
<p>
Most economists argue that layoffs and a certain amount of job insecurity are part of a healthy, competitive economy. Joseph Schumpeter labeled the process of new technologies replacing workers and new companies displacing established companies "creative destruction." While such a competitive economy isn't always pleasant for those who are temporarily out of work, most economists say it undeniably creates a more prosperous economy for all.
<p>
But most economists are never interviewed by network news reporters. The result is that, for the most part, viewers are told only about the destructiveness of a competitive economy and not job creation. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story about employment on network evening news shows (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, and NBC Nightly News) during January and February. Of the 21 stories, 19 focused on corporate layoffs and downsizing. Only two highlighted parts of the economy where jobs are plentiful. And while there were eleven soundbites from politicians, there was only one soundbite from an economist.
<p>
Tom Brokaw, on the January 29 Nightly News, expressed the typical tone. Introducing a story about "today's frightening job market," he said, "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety. A recent poll in New York state shows a third of the workers fearful they or someone in their household will lose their job, and soon. And with good reason. Last year there were more than 400,000 announced layoffs across the country, bringing the three-year total to 1.5 million."
<p>
Dan Rather, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, gave a similar diagnosis: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages." According to Rather, "Republican Pat Buchanan has hit a nerve with his rhetoric about this. He is connecting with real anger and fear in the workplace."
<p>
CBS's Wyatt Andrews, on that same broadcast, described "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 4 Nightly News, declared that "as for the future, American companies are locked on a new course. Layoffs and firings are no longer something they do only in a recession. Instead, they're business as usual."
<p>
AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 40,000 workers prompted many of the gloomy jobs stories. According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the January 3 World News, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired. AT&T announced that it was cutting 40,000 jobs." On January 2 Brokaw announced that "if what happened today to 40,000 workers at AT&T is any kind of barometer of what's ahead, it will be another long, anxious year for the American middle class."
<p>
But neither followed up on the AT&T workers. Like almost all of the other reports about the country's job picture, they ignored the parts of the economy which are generating jobs. T.J. Rogers of Cypress Semiconductor, in the March 12 Wall Street Journal, argued that "for the past decade or more, jobs have been migrating to smaller, more nimble, entrepreneurial companies from the Fortune 500 as those companies streamline and lose employment. This trend strengthens our economy, but it has created a short-term fear for their jobs among Americans."
<p>
According to Rogers: "What is not publicized is that my company has already hired some of those [laid-off] AT&T people. And our rival, Cirrus Logic, beat us to the punch in starting up a design center in South Carolina to take advantage of hiring those ex-AT&T engineers. The bad news from big companies gets front-page coverage, but the near-immediate absorption of their skilled workers is rarely discussed."
<p>
Similarly, economics columnist Robert Samuelson noted in the March 13 Washington Post that most laid-off workers find valuable employment elsewhere. "Among rehired workers," Samuelson wrote, "the Labor Department reports as follows: 27 percent got wages at least 20 percent higher than at their previous jobs; 26 percent got wages up to 20 percent higher; 16 percent suffered a pay loss no greater than 20 percent; and 31 percent suffered pay losses of more than 20 percent.
<p>
And American Enterprise Institute economist Herbert Stein pointed out in the March 14 Wall Street Journal that "in 1995, on average, 5.6 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. In the previous 20 years the rate had been lower than that in only three years." According to Stein, "The highly publicized layoffs by large corporations were a tiny fraction of the labor force and a small fraction of the number of people who enter or leave employment each year."
<p>
Stein also wrote that "concern with insecurity ought to be evident in real behavior." He noted that people didn't change their smoking or drinking behavior until they became seriously concerned with health or their social behavior until they became seriously concerned about crime. "If people were seriously concerned about their economic condition one might expect them to save more, but they don't." He noted that people are not retiring later, a trend that would be expected if workers felt financially insecure.
<p>
But good business news is rarely news. Only two network news reports focused on the country's enormous job growth. One was by Wyatt Andrews for the February 6 CBS Evening News. Andrews reported that some companies which laid off workers over the past few years have started rehiring. "The era of layoffs in America is not over," Andrews told viewers, "but there is a countertrend going on. In the latest polls, most American managers now admit they fired too many people...and that growth, including the hiring of new workers, is the only way to survive."
<p>
The other was by NBC's Linda Vester on the January 26 Nightly News. "From small machine shops to giant auto plants," Vester reported, "the manufacturing industry is in dire need of the best and the brightest." She said that many manufacturers cannot find enough skilled workers and are even employing headhunters to recruit them. Vester told viewers that "according to one study more than half of America's manufacturers say they're having trouble finding qualified people." She pointed out that people seeking to meet the demand are enrolling at vocational schools. Vester was the only reporter to interview an economist about the country's job picture.
<p>
But Vester was an exception. For most of her colleagues, two things still stand in the way of presenting their viewers with an accurate picture of the economy: The overwhelming preference they have for interviewing politicians instead of economists and their obsession with bad -- and only bad -- business news.

<center><h2>Kudos: Tim Russert</h2>
</center>
<p>
It's not very often that a network journalist talks about the positive effects of business competition and stock market growth for workers and for Main Street America. Usually, only the victims of business competition are presented to viewers and those who gain from the stock market are portrayed as greedy. The unorthodox presidential candidacy of  Republican Pat Buchanan has caused some reporters to challenge such conventional wisdom.
<p>
Case-in-point: NBC's Tim Russert on the March 3 Meet the Press. Russert challenged Buchanan's protectionist trade views by asking the candidate: "Hasn't the [foreign] competition, in fact been good for GM and Ford? Taurus is now the number one car. American cars are better because the American people opted to buy Japanese cars because the quality was better and forced American automobile manufacturers to make their cars better."
<p>
Then Russert pointed out how important the stock market is to workers. "I've talked to a lot of people in large corporations and on Wall Street over the last week," he said, "and they tell me that if your trade policies were put in place and your economic program was put in place, it would be a shock to the stock market, that the market would collapse perhaps as much as 20 percent. And they reminded me of something I'm not even sure you're aware of. Do you know what percent of the stock market is pension money? It's a third. Fifty four million people have fully-funded pensions in this country... And Mr. Buchanan, if that market was rattled by your economic policies, pensioners could lose a half billion dollars and their security is threatened."
<p>
When most reporters challenge candidates' economic policies, they do so from the left. Kudos to Russert for challenging Buchanan from the right.

<center><h2>Flat-Tax Flip-Floppers</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the recent rise in popularity of the flat tax is the way leading newspapers and magazines that previously supported the idea have suddenly turned against it. In particular, the New York Times and Washington Post had previously editorialized in favor of the flat tax, but now both oppose the idea.
<p>
For example, in an April 15, 1982 editorial, the Post said, "The ideal income tax would be a flat percentage of all income above an arbitrary threshold of, say, $10,000 per year." It concluded that the flat tax "is the obvious remedy" to the problems of the tax system.
<p>
On June 3, 1982 the Post reiterated its support. "Replacing the [tax] system with a low-rate tax on income -- with few, if any, exclusions allowed -- is an idea that, by promising efficiency, equity and simplicity, appeals to all parts of the political spectrum," it said.
<p>
Fourteen years later, however, the Post is now opposed to what it had earlier supported. On January 19, the Post called the flat tax "a flawed idea, less a serious tax proposal than a slogan in the name of which the advocates claim to be able to accomplish several things at once." It concluded that the flat tax "wouldn't be an improvement." 
<p>
Back in 1982 the New York Times supported the flat tax. In a June 6, 1982 editorial, the Times favored "a flat-rate tax levied on a greatly broadened income base." It even praised Senator Jesse Helms's proposed 12 percent flat-rate tax.
<p>
As recently as 1992 the Times reiterated its support for the flat tax. In a March 27, 1992 editorial the Times explicitly endorsed the Hall-Rabushka plan upon which the Armey and Forbes plans are based. It called the flat tax "a superb idea."
<p>
But like the Post, the Times now opposes a flat tax. In a January 18, 1996 editorial the Times found "a glaring fault" in the flat tax. Like Claude Rains in Casablanca, the Times is now shocked, shocked to discover that the flat tax will benefit the wealthy! It concluded by denouncing the Forbes plan.
<p>
<%-2>Individual reporters have also flip-flopped on the flat tax. For example, <BI>Business Week<D>'s <B>Chris Farrell<D> thought the flat tax was great in a January 9, 1995 column. "If Washington legislators truly want to make a difference, they should...embrace a flat tax," he wrote. The Armey plan "makes sense  -- far more than any other reform being considered. Limiting exemptions and deductions would lower the tax rate by broadening the tax base. And the change would encourage a more efficient allocation of resources."<BI%0>
<p>
But like the Post and the Times, Farrell has suddenly decided that the flat tax is too risky. In a February 19, 1996 column, Farrell said flat-tax advocates are wrong. "Their florid rhetoric vastly overstates the economic gains and deeply understates the risks," he wrote. "The gains could be easily dwarfed by wrenching business and household upheavals as America shifts to a new tax code. Indeed, the transition to a flat tax is fraught with danger -- so much so that the long- term payoff may never come." According to Farrell, the stock market, home prices, and consumer spending all would collapse under a flat tax.
<p>
Such predictions can only be described as total nonsense. As Professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out, the magnitude of tax changes under a flat tax would be no greater than what we experienced in 1981 and 1986. And the impact on financial markets would be no greater than those experienced many times in the postwar era, when interest rates either rose or fell sharply. Moreover, there is no question that a flat tax will cause the stock market to rise, not fall.
<p>
Unfortunately, the ranks of those who have switched gears on the flat tax include conservatives. As a columnist, Pat Buchanan strongly supported Armey's flat-tax proposal. However, as a presidential candidate, Buchanan opposes it. In a January 27, 1996 article in the New York Times, Buchanan called the flat tax "simplistic" and attacked it for cutting the taxes of the rich. No wonder the Times published it.
<p>
<%-2>Of course, everyone has the right -- indeed, the obligation -- to reconsider their positions when con- fronted with new information. But when major newspapers and prominent writers switch their positions 180 degrees on a major issue, especially within a short period of time, readers are entitled to an explanation. Otherwise, they can only assume that prevailing fashion dictates editorial views, rather than facts and analysis, and that such views aren't worthy of serious consideration.<%0>

<TITLE>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</TITLE>

<h2><center>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</h2>
<p>
<h3>Fox's Profit Motive</h3></center>
<p>
Profit, a new prime time show on Fox, starts from a unique premise. Far from being the sympathetic hero, Jim Profit, the main character whose voice narrates the show, is a villain. Viewers naturally root against, rather than for, the show's namesake. This is new, different, and daring, and it makes for entertaining television. But in another way, Profit is anything but new. As is so often the case on TV, the villain is a corporate executive. 
Jim Profit, in fact, is a supervillain gone berserk. In the show's premiere  episode, which aired April 8, Profit is shown to be a relentless climber at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), the company where he is a vice president. He uses confidential information to blackmail a decent secretary into sabotaging her equally decent boss, whose job Profit covets. When the secretary later comes to work for Profit, he says: "It's good to see Gail understands the basic nature of business. We adapt or pay the price."
<p>
He uses other ruthless means to weed out those in his way. He frames a female vice president for the blackmail of the secretary, getting her fired. He seduces the wife of another vice president, and then masterminds a plan to make it look like she's sleeping with G&G's CEO. When her husband beats up the CEO (who, by the way, does pick a new mistress every year), he gets fired. And viewers find out that Profit became a vice president in the first place by inducing a heart attack in the vice president above him.
How did profit become so evil? Late in the premiere, viewers learn that as a child Profit was forced by his father to live in a cardboard box and spent all his time watching television through a hole cut out of the box. Profit tracks down his father, kills him, and threatens to frame his stepmother if she turns him in or tries to thwart his business plans.
<p>
The appearance of the show has rekindled a long-running debate about Hollywood's portrayal of business. The experts' conventional wisdom: the greedy scoundrels are getting what they deserve. Graef Crystal, a psychologist and compensation expert, told USA Today that employees "can't take out [their] rage on the CEO -- that person is too powerful. You probably can't even talk to the press for fear of losing your job. But a show that makes you say 'yes, that's exactly what it's like' will hold your attention." 
<p>
Alan Merten, dean of Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, also pinned the blame on the business world. He told USA Today that corporate executives "should look at this trend and realize that whatever their financial motives, their actions aren't playing well in Peoria. The timing of some large layoffs and big [executive] bonus packages has been terrible."
<p>
Perhaps. But Hollywood's business bashing isn't, as Merten suggests, a new trend; it's an institution. The show Dallas was popular long before the current wave of layoffs and in a 1992 Media Research Center study of entertainment programming, businessmen were 43 percent of the criminals, far more than lawyers, politicians, or any other profession. Even, in the past, when there have been positive business characters, such as the business owners on Designing Women, they haven't been positive because of their business. By contrast, there were evil lawyers on L.A. Law, but also lawyers who benefited society because of the work they did.
<p>
A more likely explanation for Hollywood's continued business bashing is that entertainment television writers still hold to an ideology which cannot conceive of business as an honorable calling that serves society by producing goods, services, wealth, and jobs. Profit, to them, seems to be a four-letter word.

<center><h2>Kudos: Time's Branegan and CBS's Brady</h2></center>
<p>
With job insecurity garnering headlines in the U.S. and many demanding that the government "do something" about it, few reporters have looked overseas to see what happens when governments try. Time's Jay Branegan did. According to Branegan, in the April 15 issue, "The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries. Call it Eurosclerosis -- the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship."
<p>
Branegan's evidence: "Europe's unemployment rate of 11 percent is twice as high as the U.S.'s, and its job creation chart is a flat line. Over the past three years, the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs, Europe none. Significantly, many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages, and as many as 60 percent are managerial or professional." Branegan also pointed out that high minimum-wage laws in such countries as France mean "many [Frenchmen] aren't working at all. Joblessness among young people, hit hardest by minimum-wage laws, is roughly twice France's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent." Something for reporters to keep in mind as American politicians debate raising the U.S. minimum wage.
<p>
On the March 26 CBS Evening News, correspondent Ray Brady reported on one form of government spending that has largely escaped the budget ax -- corporate welfare. Specifically, Brady looked at federal subsidies for ethanol. According to Brady, "Critics, even those within the U.S. government, say the virtues of ethanol are way overstated. At a time when the government is cutting on social programs, they question why it's still handing out subsidies to the ethanol industry, subsidies that amount to nearly $800 million a year."
<p>
Brady recounted how "ethanol was born of desperation during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, when gasoline prices soared and lines pressed for miles. But now gasoline is plentiful, much cheaper to produce than ethanol. And today, ethanol accounts for just over one percent of all U.S. energy consumption." And while "ethanol does reduce some pollutants, the Congressional Budget Office says it contributes to others, such as ozone pollution."
<p>
Why, then, does the subsidy continue? "Many point to the lobbying of corn growers and generous political donations to both parties by Archer Daniels Midland, the world's largest producer of ethanol, and a major beneficiary of the government's subsidies." According to Brady, the ethanol industry has "racked up $6 billion in subsidies, courtesy of the American taxpayer."
<p>
Kudos to Branegan and Brady for practicing journalism at its best, with Branegan looking at the results of programs politicians are proposing and with Brady questioning programs neither political party wants questioned.

<p>
<h3>Privatized Paupers? No</h3>
</center>
<p>
On March 11 and 12, the CBS Evening News broadcast a two-part "Eye on America" segment by Ray Brady focusing on Social Security privatization. What started out as a compelling case for reform of the soon-to-be bankrupt pension program ended up as a broadside attack against the most promising reform -- privatization.
<p>
First, the background. Social Security now has an unfunded long-term liability of more than $5 trillion -- which exceeds the entire national debt. In 35 years, the system will be financially insolvent. Kaput. As CBS rightly pointed out, in 1950 there were 17 workers for every retired person. Today there are three; by 2030 there will be just two. To keep the system solvent at current benefit levels would require the tax rate to rise from 15 percent to as much as 30 percent. If there were ever a program that needed major reform, it is this one.
<p>
CBS discussed one potential way out of the box: to privatize the system and allow individual workers to place their payroll tax dollars into a personalized account, like an expanded IRA. Under rules established by the government, workers could invest this money in mutual funds and other investments. Brady interviewed Jose Pinera, the former economic minister of Chile, where privatization was adopted some 15 years ago. The results there have been remarkably successful. Chilean workers are now receiving a 13 percent annual rate of return on their Social Security investments.
<p>
Brady then cited a Cato Institute study documenting that in the United States, if a low-income worker were permitted to place his payroll taxes into an IRA, and that worker earned just the average rate of return on stocks and bonds since 1946, that worker would receive a benefit of $1,650 more per month from the IRA than under Social Security. As one of the editors of that study, I can attest that the results were reviewed by well-respected actuaries who found no fault with the methodology.
<p>
Brady, however, launched an attack against privatization by arguing that the Cato study made "dangerously optimistic assumptions." The "dangerously optimistic assumption" was that over the next 50 years investors will yield roughly the same average real rate of return in stocks and bonds as was recorded by financial markets over the past 50 years. No one knows for sure whether the markets will perform better or worse. Still, it is worth noting that over the past several years the stock market has substantially outperformed the average rate of return since 1945.
<p>
Then CBS rolled out objections to the plan, such as claims that the plan only works if "workers work their whole lifetime in a boom stock market." This is patently false. If we had a boom market for the next 50 years, and we privatized Social Security, most American workers would be millionaire pensioners when they retired. But even if workers placed all of their payroll tax into low-risk, low-return bonds, privatization is still a very good deal for workers of all incomes, vis-a-vis a non-privatized system.
<p>
The CBS report saved its heavy artillery for last. Brady said that instead of "making educated guesses about the future, like the proponents of privatization, we took a look at how a Social Security stock plan would have performed using real data from the past." (Note the false inference here, that the Cato Institute study did not "use real data from the past.") "Using an independent firm," CBS reported that a wealthy worker would get $30,000 more under privatization, but a low-income worker would get $13,000 less. Conclusion: privatization is unfair.
<p>
Just how were those numbers derived? Alas, we will never know. After repeated requests for the methodology, CBS has refused to reveal what firm produced them, what actuarial assumptions were used, and any other information about the results. While CBS was quick to attack privatization advocates for using "dangerous assumptions," that charge can't be made against CBS; the company won't tell us what their assumptions were. For all we know, the numbers were simply made up out of thin air.
<p>
Finally, CBS concluded that most Americans oppose Social Security privatization. How should the system be fixed, then? "Cut benefits and raise Social Security taxes." Two problems here. First, virtually every poll over the past ten years shows that raising the payroll tax is by far the least popular "fix" to the Social Security system. Second, raising the tax level and reducing the promised benefit make Social Security an even worse deal than it already is for young workers. Now they would have to pay more in for a lower benefit. What a deal! If we "reformed" Social Security in the way CBS suggests, privatization would be manifoldly more attractive to workers. Was this taken into account when CBS said low-income workers would be worse off under privatization?
<p>
Social Security reform is perhaps the single most important issue to young workers in America. What is needed is a careful, balanced, and reasoned presentation of the options. Too bad Ray Brady and CBS failed to provide it.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</h2>
<p>
<h3>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages</h3>
</center>
<p>
Last month, MediaNomics reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 Today, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
<p>
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 World News Sunday, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 Nightly News, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<title>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</title>

<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Networks Pump Up Gas-Price Story</center></h3>
<p>
Given how closely tuned the media antennae are to the political world, it's no surprise that the recent bump in gasoline prices was big news. Politicians in both parties tried to make political hay out of the price increase. Few reporters questioned their rhetoric by pointing out that gas prices, by historical standards, are not high and that they would be even lower if it weren't for taxes and regulations.
<p>
CBS saw a capitalist conspiracy behind the price hike. Dan Rather sounded the alarm on the April 30 CBS Evening News: "It's the question every American driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price of gasoline going up and up and up? Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even something more sinister?"
<p>
CBS economics correspondent Ray Brady suspected the latter. After an industry soundbite defending the price hikes, Brady reported that "critics say those high pump prices come from gouging, [that] the industry deliberately let supplies drop." Brady also blamed Americans for "driving longer distances to work in popular gas guzzlers. And speeding; no more 55-mile-an-hour federal speed limit."
<p>
Curiously, in the very next story, CBS didn't hint at conspiracy when Clinton moved to keep beef prices high. According to Rather, "President Clinton is giving some election-year help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their lowest level in ten years."
<p>
The other networks were a little more calm about the gasoline price hike. ABC's Brian Rooney, on the April 24 World News Tonight, blamed "a combination of unrelated events" for the higher gasoline prices. Rooney pointed out that "crude oil traders were predicting that the United Nations would partially lift the ban on Iraqi oil, which would have put more and cheaper oil on the market. When that didn't happen, the rush to buy from other sources drove the price up." Rooney also informed viewers that the long Northeastern winter contributed to the higher prices.
<p>
Over at NBC, Tom Brokaw said, on the April 30 Nightly News: "We don't have to tell you tonight that gas prices are still stuck at very high levels." Of the government investigation, correspondent Pete Williams said: "Some government economists are skeptical the investigation will turn up anything illegal." He also pinned blame on the weather: "They say prices are up because the severe storm from last winter drove up demand for heating oil, leaving less crude oil for making gasoline."
<p>
Rooney and Williams were correct, as far as they went. But were gas price really "at very high levels"? John Merline, in the May 7 Investor's Business Daily, looked at history for an answer. "After controlling for inflation," he reported, "a gallon of gas today costs 27 percent less than it did in 1949, and 23 percent less than a gallon did as recently as 1985." He pointed out that "even at the high pump prices posted at the end of April, the average national gasoline price is about the same as it was in June of last year."
<p>
Merline spotted the real story, that "today's prices would be lower still were it not for the substantial added cost imposed by government." Neither Brady, Rooney, or Williams mentioned, as Merline did, that "today, the combined federal-state tax is 37 cents a gallon. The federal tax stands at 18 cents a gallon, and the median state tax is 19 cents." 
<p>
"At today's prices," he added, "taxes alone account for more than a quarter of the pump price." Merline also explained that government regulations raise the price of gasoline at least four cents a gallon.
<p>
While Rooney and Williams at least didn't get the story wrong, they still didn't get the full story. Many network news viewers still may not know how much government adds to the price of gasoline.

<p>
What would someone with one foot in the civil rights community and one in the business world think about proposals to raise the minimum wage? Reporter Michael Winsop, in the May 10 New York Times, sought to answer that question. He interviewed Robert Bobbitt, Sr., past president of the board of the Canton, Ohio Urban League and now an owner of four McDonald's franchises in Canton's suburbs.
<p>
Winsop explained that "being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrat's current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why." According to Bobbitt, "Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue. Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
<p>
Winsop told how Bobbitt and another businessman went to see their Congressman. "They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teenagers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance."
<p>
In the May 5 Washington Post, staff writer Steven Pearlstein poked holes in the conventional wisdom about falling wages. Pointing to studies showing falling wages, he wrote that "by measuring only cash wages, the median wage series ignores the fact that employees have been receiving a greater share of their compensation in the form of tax-free fringe benefits." According to Pearlstein, "Most economists now agree that the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index, overstates the rise in the cost of living. And because income data are adjusted by the CPI, the effect of overstating inflation is to understate income."
<p>
Kudos to Winsop and Pearlstein for showing underreported sides of economic stories.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</title>

<center><h2>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</h2></center>
<center><h3>Easy Money for Trial Lawyers</h3></center>

Time Warner's Money magazine claims to be a publication for serious investors. 
But lately Money seems to be fronting for an unholy alliance of anti-business 
activist Ralph Nader and a small group of the nation's most predatory trial 
lawyers. While dozens of liberal Democrats joined Republicans last December in 
passing securities litigation reform legislation in the only override of a 
Clinton veto, Money aligned itself with Nader's camp against the popular reform 
bill.
<p>
For years, "strike suit" securities lawyers have reaped lavish incomes 
targeting advanced technology and other growth companies. When stock prices 
drop suddenly, the lawyers typically swoop down and extract multimillion-dollar 
settlements. The system has made it so costly for companies to defend 
themselves against baseless charges that many are forced to settle out of 
court.
<p>
Over the past four years, settlements in such suits have cost investors more 
than $2.5 billion, one third of which -- $825 million -- went straight into the 
pockets of the "strike suit" lawyers.
<p>
The securities bar helped finance Ralph Nader's high-profile campaign against 
the federal legislation to curb abusive securities suits. Then President 
Clinton -- whose career has been largely financed by trial lawyers' largesse -- 
vetoed the legislation.
<p>
Scores of liberal Democrats, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, and California Rep. Vic Fazio, joined 
Republicans to override the veto. They found support in much of the media, 
including a Washington Post editorial charging Clinton had "caved to the trial 
lawyers' lobby."
<p>
But Nader, President Clinton, and the trial lawyers had a reliable ally in 
Money magazine. Money's coverage was brazenly one-sided. In four of the five 
monthly editions preceding passage of the bill, managing editor Frank Lalli 
used his column to inveigh against the legislation. Money's fixation is all the 
more notable because Lalli's column is the only opinion piece each month. The 
magazine even ginned up a letter-writing campaign in support of a veto.
During the year of congressional debate on the bill, Money published no 
information about the benefits of the legislation, just Lalli's opinions.
<p>
Month after month, Money's opinion campaign broke the rules of honest advocacy. 
Persistently, the magazine published false or misleading characterizations of 
the reform bill. For instance:
Money falsely charged that the bill would "allow executives to deliberately 
lie." In fact, the bill specifically outlaws executives from making knowingly 
fraudulent statements. The bill does create a limited "safe harbor" for 
good-faith disclosure of forward-looking financial information. A Washington 
Post editorial praised the "safe harbor" for shielding companies "from a style 
of legal assault that is not far from extortion."
<p>
Money wrongly complained that "investors who sue and lose could be forced to 
pay the winner's court costs." The bill does not impose a "loser pays" or "fee 
shifting" provision. Instead it takes a modest step to toughen existing federal 
rules against frivolous claims, whether they are made by the plaintiff or 
defendant.
<p>
Money put things completely backwards in saying "accountants who okay 
fraudulent books will get protection." In fact, the bill gives the Securities 
and Exchange Commission new power to act against accountants, lawyers, and 
others who assist securities fraud.
<p>
The magazine refused to publish letters to the editor in support of the reform 
bill. It is unclear why a publication that professes to be a serious investors' 
magazine allowed only one side's arguments to be heard on an important issue 
for investors. Whatever the motive may be, surely it is not a serious search 
for the truth.
<p>
Securities litigation reform remains a hot political item. Securities lawyers 
are spending millions of dollars on a California ballot initiative that would 
effectively negate the new federal reform law's effect in that state and across 
the nation. Ralph Nader is campaigning ardently for the trial lawyers' 
initiative.
<p>
Those who keep Money magazine in business should take serious stock of its 
editorial policies and practices. Time Warner shareholders and executives -- 
and Money's readers and advertisers -- are in the best position to decide what 
editorial opinions on public policies best reflect their values. But clearly 
everyone is done a disservice when a publication attempts to justify its 
editorial opinion through falsehood and distortion.

the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

<title>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of 
Debate</h2></center>
<center><h3>Minimum Depth on Minimum Wage</h3></center>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans 
and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats 
argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the 
minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that 
by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off 
workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed 
all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and 
morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor reads 
about the debate. With a few exceptions, the networks took the side of those 
supporting a minimum-wage increase. For example:
Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the 
minimum-wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported 
the minimum-wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories 
contained soundbites only from Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites 
from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage 
workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. 
"Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that 
Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a 
vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum-wage hike led some reporters to 
accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming 
workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a 
minimum-wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now 
earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's 
Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people 
earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political 
pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick 
Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum-wage increase."
The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the 
economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists; 
there were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more 
interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the 
effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 
Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting 
millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their 
heels, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And 
ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the 
Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in 
interviewing economists. The obsession with political angles reached almost 
comic proportions at times. On the morning shows, where live interviews are 
common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage, 
but none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America 
Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's 
Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel 
interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith 
interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were 
interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three 
stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because 
their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World 
News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum-wage hike] is bad for 
small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, 
Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of 
their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that 
Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the analogous charge against Democrats, that they support the 
increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, 
on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake 
for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose 
ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one 
most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two 
economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and 
Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, compared 
to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. 
They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since 
this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by 
advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. 
NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. 
Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found 
with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the 
study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his 
criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute 
Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions to the biased coverage. ABC's Bob Zelnick, on the April 
24 Good Morning America, pointed out that "if labor costs rise too much, many 
employers might simply fire workers or cut back on new hires." And while 
journalists usually don't bother to interview small-business owners about how 
political policies will affect them, several did interview them about the 
minimum wage. NBC's Tom Brokaw devoted an entire Nightly News segment to the 
concerns of a small business owner "in his own words."
<p>
By far the best interview segment about the minimum wage was Anthony Mason's 
interview of Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David 
Bonior for the April 22 CBS This Morning. Mason challenged both politicians, 
and in so doing brought up points no other reporter mentioned. For instance, he 
asked Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor 
statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to 
cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?"
<p>
He also asked Bonior, "Congressman, in the first two years of President 
Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. 
Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election? You 
had an opportunity to do something and it wasn't done then." Mason was the only 
reporter to look at what happened after past federal minimum-wage hikes and to 
point out that the Democrats didn't increase the minimum wage when they 
controlled Congress.
<p>
But for the most part, coverage of the minimum wage was overwhelmingly devoted 
to superficial political calculations, and even then, biased against those who 
opposed an increase in the minimum wage.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<H2><center>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>No Skepticism Toward College Costs</h3></center>
<p>
Imagine that there's a product or a service that has gone up in price by 239 percent over the past fifteen years and whose cost continues to increase well ahead of the rate of inflation. Imagine further that the company that produces the product or service blames consumers for the steep price increases. Would reporters accept such an excuse at face value? The CEO of the company would surely be seen sweating before the cameras of 60 Minutes or getting stern lectures from Nightline's Ted Koppel, right?
<p><b>
Not if the product is a college education.</B><br>
The same reporters who are quick to expect the worst -- and demand government action -- when businesses raise prices show a curious lack of curiosity about the shocking rise in college tuition rates over the past several years. In stories about tuition hikes, reporters almost never question the price increases. And they never, ever, bring up the explanation many conservatives and economists point to: government education subsidies help cause the price hikes.
<p>
The most recent example of this lack of skepticism came when President Clinton proposed a $1,500 tax credit for students in their first two years of college. On June 4, the day Clinton announced his proposal, no network report even hinted that it might cause tuition increases. CBS's Rita Braver, for example, merely said that it was "aimed at attracting all students into post-high school education." Peter Jennings called it "the latest giveaway in presidential politics." (That's what they always call tax cuts.) Jennings did point out in the next story that "college expenses are growing at twice the rate of inflation." But he didn't ask why or suggest that some argue Clinton's proposal would add to the problem.
<p>
This is part of a long pattern in network reporting on higher education. Media Research Center analysts reviewed all 23 stories about higher education financing on the ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC news shows between June 1, 1995 and June 1, 1996. No reporter in any of the stories mentioned the argument that federal aid helps fuel the escalation in tuition costs.
<p>
To be sure, reporters often do point out that tuition costs are increasing dramatically. Many of the stories on higher education focus on families trying to deal with such costs. ABC's Tyler Mathison, on the July 12, 1995 <i>Good Morning America</i>, reported that with costs so high, "it's no wonder more and more American families are borrowing to pay the bills." Many stories are helpful to consumers by pointing out which colleges are the best buys.
<p>
But reporters rarely ask why college costs are rising. And when they do, they accept, without challenge, answers they would never accept from industry. Example: CBS's Susan Spencer, on the May 2, 1996 48 Hours. A college administrator told her that he would like to cut costs, but it might hurt the reputation of his school. "So most colleges aren't even trying to cut tuition," Spencer reported. "People might think the quality of education had been cut as well."
<p>
CBS had a different attitude toward the recent gasoline price increases. Dan Rather wondered: "Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or something more sinister?" The networks have also demanded explanations for price increases of other products, such as gasoline or breakfast cereals. But the ivory tower is above such questioning.
<p>
This omission leads to biased reporting of education policy proposals. CNN's Bobbie Battista, reporting on a speech by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the June 1, 1995 Inside Politics, said: "Mrs. Clinton also tweaked those who benefited from the U.S. education system and now want to cut it...She didn't name names, but presidential candidate Phil Gramm, who wants to abolish the Department of Education, went to college thanks to government-sponsored loans." And in hundreds of stories over the past year, Bill Clinton repeated his claim that cutting federal aid to students was "extreme" without being asked why taxpayers must continue to finance higher education's largesse.
<p>
Only one network reporter even suggested the tuition price increases may not be justified. Former CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, on March 12, pointed out that "the private sector, in terms of business out there, has done all this cutting over the last ten years or so to become more competitive." He asked consumer reporter Hattie Kauffman: "Are colleges doing that at all?" But even Smith didn't point out the argument that colleges and universities are shielded from such efficiency because of government subsidies.
<p>
Had he read an article by John Hood of the John Locke Foundation, in the May, 1995 issue of Reason, he might have. "Is land for classrooms that much more expensive? Is there a shortage of people becoming professors, bidding up the wages of those currently in colleges and universities? Do books cost more than they used to?" Hood asks. "The short answer is maybe -- but the cost increase in higher education far outpaces increases in any of those expenditures."
<p>
According to Hood, there are so many government subsidies at even private colleges and universities that "tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education. The 'costs' themselves are essentially arbitrary." Hood explains that federal aid is given to a student based on how much costs exceed the student's "expected family contribution." Since colleges and universities know the average expected family contribution, they can increase tuitions and make more students eligible for aid. "Families will pay more, but a good portion of the tuition hike will be picked up by the government. Hence, colleges and universities can get more money for providing exactly the same service."
<p>
Proof? Hood looks at history. "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges," he claims. "Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges." He points out that revenue from Pell grants rose by more than 25 percent between 1985 and 1992 and that state level grants rose by 15 percent. All the while, college administrators were complaining about "cutbacks" in federal aid and using that as an excuse to raise tuition.
<p>
But network reporters don't challenge college administrators about their continuous price increases. Apparently, when it comes to higher education, greed is good, or at least not worthy of criticism.

<h2><center>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Press: Fiscal Conservatives?</center></h3>
<p>
"There is a liberal bias [in the media]; it's demonstrable." 
"The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
Are these quotes from Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey? Or maybe Rush Limbaugh and William Bennett? No, the above quotes are from two members of the "media elite" -- Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg.
<p>
In the face of overwhelming evidence, some journalists are beginning to admit there's a liberal bias in the national media. But many of them ludicrously maintain that the bias only extends to social and cultural issues, not to economic issues, and that most reporters are in fact economic conservatives.
James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly makes this claim in his recent book Breaking the News. He argues that "the supposed liberalism of the elite press is more limited than many people believe. On economic issues -- taxes, welfare, deficit control, trade policy, attitudes toward labor unions -- elite reporters' views have become far more conservative over the last generation, as their incomes have gone up."
<p>
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne agrees. During a May 29 Brookings Institution panel discussion, he said that "the press mostly has the biases of the educated, some would say over-educated, upper middle class." This, Dionne argued, means there is a  liberal bias in coverage of social issues, but "the issues we're most conservative on are in fact economic issues, just like much of the upper middle class that looks at its tax bill."
<p>
Fallows and Dionne are highly- regarded beltway journalists, and properly so. But on this issue they are terribly mistaken. Their argument lacks one element: proof. Numerous studies conducted by the Media Research Center demonstrate that most economic reporting in the non-business media is solidly liberal. For example:
<p>
Tax cuts. Reporters used to be less biased in tax coverage than they have been recently. It was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 that ended any semblence of balance on tax issues. When tax cuts were being discussed in December of 1994, all 12 economists interviewed by the networks were against cutting taxes. The message: no matter what politicians say, tax cuts are bad economics. Then this year, when Steve Forbes' flat tax became a hot issue, reporters were more than twice as likely to mention arguments against it than for it. Fifty-one arguments against the flat tax were presented during January on the networks and in national news magazines. Only 24 arguments in favor were presented. Fallows and Dionne must know that "Reaganomics" has become a cuss word among reporters.
<p>
Federal regulations and mandates. Like most liberals, reporters seem to think businesses have money trees in their stockrooms. It rarely occurs to them that companies may have to increase prices, lay off workers, or reduce salaries and benefits in order to comply with regulations and mandates. A recent example is the debate over increasing the minimum wage. During the first four months of 1996, there were 60 sources interviewed for soundbites by the networks. Almost twice as many supported the increase (39) than opposed it (21).
<p>
Some reporters simply accepted the Democrats' logic at face value. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, the increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers" who earn near the minimum wage. CNN's Kathleen Kennedy worried that if the two parties couldn't agree, "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon."
<p>
Federal spending and the budget. Reporters seem to favor budget discipline when the issue is cutting taxes. But when spending programs are threatened, anecdotes abound outlining who will allegedly be harmed by fiscal restraint. During the first hundred days of this Congress, 34 network stories asserted that a balanced budget achieved by spending restraint would harm the poor. Only four stories focused on the benefits of a more limited government. And during the two government shutdowns last year, reporters repeatedly intoned about the "critical cuts" (Dan Rather) and "major cutbacks" (Tom Brokaw) in the GOP budget, without mentioning that Republicans planned to spend $267 billion more in 2002 than in 1996. According to CBS's Bob Mc-Namara, the shutdowns were "a hard lesson on what happens when big government goes away."
<p>
Part of the Fallows-Dionne misunderstanding may be in defining economic conservatism. For some reporters the definition is broad enough to include the architect of the Clinton health plan. CNN's Jeff Levine, on the August 30, 1993 Inside Politics, described (I'm not making this up) "the Ira Magaziner people" as "free marketeers."
<p>
If someone who proposed the biggest increase in government power since the New Deal is a "free marketeer," then who isn't? But if the definition includes, at the very least, some skepticism about government's ability to solve society's problems, few in the "media elite" qualify.

<title>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Poll: Workers: Happy. Media: Yawn.</center></h3>
<p>
Few mantras have been repeated more often in the media this year than the one about anxious American workers. It's accepted as fact among reporters that American workers are alarmed about their prospects in the new, global economy.
Just ask Dan Rather. As MediaNomics reported earlier this year, he spotted "fear and anger" in the workforce over "layoffs and barely rising wages." According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired." 
<p>
Tom Brokaw, introducing a January 29 Nightly News story about "today's frightening job market," announced: "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety." 
<p>
The print media have been similarlyfocused on gloom. The January 22 U.S. News & World Report cover asked: "Is the American Worker Getting Shafted?" (The magazine's answer: yes.) Newsweek's February 26 cover labeled four executives who had laid off employees as "Corporate Killers," and declared that the "public is scared as hell."
<p>
The New York Times saw fit to print a seven-part series depicting American workplaces as "battlefields" with "millions of casualties." According to the Times, the story of a man who lost a high-paying bank job, was forced to take a job at one-fourth the pay, and then had his family leave him "is no longer extraordinary."
<p><b>
Really?</b><br>
To find out, Inc. magazine tried something different. Rather than repeating emotional anecdotes about companies laying off loyal workers, Inc. commissioned the Gallup Organization to conduct a nationwide poll of workers.
<p>
"Across the board the 34 questions [to the worker survey] prompted upbeat -- sometimes even glowing -- responses," the magazine found. For example: 90 percent of the respondents were not worried about losing their jobs and 75 percent had not had three or more days in the past month when stress caused them to behave badly with their families. (For more survey results, see box.)
<p>
Interestingly, Inc. found that on many questions, workers at smaller companies are happier than those at large firms. The national media may be missing the story of worker happiness because they relentlessly focus on big business. Last summer, Media- Nomics found that in the first six months of 1995, there were 119 network evening news stories on the health of large companies, while only 13 stories focused on the health of those companies not in the Fortune 500.
This is truly a whopper of an omission, since smaller, fast-growing companies ("gazelles") created five million jobs between 1990 and 1994, while other companies lost 800,000.
<p>
The non-business media have not reported Inc.'s findings and have yet to tell the whole story about the true nature of the American workplace. It is a picture of the entire economy -- they aren't telling the whole story.

On May 2, the Clinton administration (and many reporters) busily played up the 
news that the economy had grown at a 2.8 percent rate. ABC's Brit Hume, while 
not downplaying the news, put it in political perspective.
<P>
Hume reported that Clinton economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson called this 
"the second longest peacetime expansion since World War II, not mentioning that 
the longest was during the Reagan years, which the Clinton administration 
prefers to call the decade of greed." Hume pointed out that "she also did not 
mention that the expansion includes the last part of the Bush administration, a 
time Mr. Clinton always claimed was a recession."
<P>
Later that month, NBC's Mike Jensen reported another bit of good economic news. 
The giant companies that had been downsizing, Jensen said, have "finally 
started to rehire."
<P>
Unlike past reports on downsizing, Jensen interviewed a consultant who 
explained that the downsizing wave allowed companies to become more productive 
and profitable. The consultant, John Challenger, told viewers: "These companies 
are able to hire many people because of the downsizing decisions they made over 
the last few years."
<P>
Jensen even mentioned something rarely revealed in the news: "Ninety thousand 
new jobs were added to the nation's workforce every month on average for the 
last year, many of them at small companies." Jensen ended on a negative note, 
though. He said that many of these big companies are still downsizing their 
weaker divisions. "That's the new corporate America. Quick to fire, quick to 
hire, with American workers scrambling to find a job and to keep one." (See 
front page for why that's not the typical plight of workers.)

<title>The Algers: Back to the Future</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>The Algers: Back to the Future</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CBS show highlights successful owners of growing businesses</h3></center>
<p>
On the evening of June 16, CBS aired a program whose message was mainstream American: that talent, initiative, perseverance, and, usually, religious faith are the formula for business success. For an hour viewers saw an unusual sight: Hollywood celebrities unabashedly touting the virtues of free market successes.
A rerun from the 1950s? Hardly. It was the 48th annual Horatio Alger Awards. From the opening segment, Ray Charles's rendition of "America the Beautiful," Bob Dole and William Bennett couldn't have scripted a more tradition-friendly, role model-dominated hour.
<p>
As always, Algers were presented to persons who, like the award's namesake, have emerged from humble circumstances to make a name for themselves. Each story is magnificent non-fiction that shatters the myth that America is no longer the land of opportunity. 
<p>
This path, as viewers saw, knows neither gender nor color: among this year's honorees were a woman -- Ruth Fertel, founder of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain -- and two blacks: music entrepreneur Quincy Jones and Joe Dudley, who grew up in a three-room shack as one of eleven children and now runs the Dudley Products cosmetics company.
<p>
In videotaped biographical packages preceding their acceptance of the award, the winners discussed their success and their philosophies of life. By dint of hard work, Herbert Boeckmann wound up running the largest Ford dealership in America. This highly motivated achiever spoke movingly of how his father's charitable deeds had spurred his own efforts toward "help[ing] people help themselves."
<p> 
Qunicy Jones reflected: "I don't think God put us here to have everything go right every minute. That's why He's got those other funny words like 'discipline' and 'adversity.' That's what helps shape your character, and it sounds corny, but it's not corny, it's real."  
<p>
John Pappajohn, the president of Equity Dynamics, reminisced about growing up: "We didn't have much money, but we seemed to get along just fine." And he remarked, "I was recently asked by a young man who suffered adversity, 'What do I have to do in order to be successful?' I said, 'Have a dream, and be willing to pay the price in order to have your dream come true.'" 
<p>
Dennis Washington, who now presides over a business empire which includes construction, railroad, mining, and shipping companies, remembered, "We didn't have a lot of money...but the family was together. That means so much."
Looking back, Washington says, "The early part of your life, you may get [dealt] a bad hand, but, remember, that's a [short] period...and if you can focus on the future by finding something that you like to do, with luck and help from God, you're gonna have a good life." 
<p>
As traditional values-oriented as the Algers were, there was nothing politically partisan about them. (Even a brief appearance by Maya Angelou was non-PC.) The show was co-hosted by actress Markie Post and actor John Ritter, both of whom have been outspokenly pro-Clinton; nonetheless, they effectively articulated what the Algers represent. 
<p>
When Ritter, introducing one honoree -- Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula -- declared, "Values, beliefs, principles. You know, some call those old-fashioned, but to others, they're the surest sign of leadership," it was hard to imagine Charlton Heston doing it any better.
<p>
The Algers were produced for television by actor Don Johnson. Two years ago, on the occasion of the ceremony's first national telecast, Johnson told the Media Research Center that the awards are "based on good, old-fashioned, fundamental tools for success...Let's encourage success. That's what America's about." Again, like Post and Ritter, Johnson is not known as a conservative Republican. <p> 
The Algers will never be standard prime time fare, yet it's hard not to think that there's room for other programs like it. And perhaps some of prime time television's scriptwriters, who so often like to paint businessmen as society's villains, were watching and picking up ideas for inspirational business storylines.

<title>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</h2></center>
<p>
In 1994 Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger released the "New Jersey Study," a research paper which claimed that a hike in the minimum wage would increase employment. The Card-Krueger study received considerable press attention, and very little scrutiny, even though it provided the intellectual argument for the Clinton administration's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour in February of this year.   
<p>
The New York Times, for example, touted the study and its call for a hike in the minimum wage in several stories. The Times' Louis Uchitelle wrote in the January 12 Business section: "Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage." 
<p>
Since the initial reports of the Card-Krueger study, however, the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) has found that the study is based on flawed data. In a March 29 Wall Street Journal column, EPI Executive Director Richard Berman contends that "the Card-Krueger data are worse than flawed -- they are grossly inaccurate." Berman continues: "How do I know? My organization took the time to check the actual payroll records [studied by Card and Krueger]...The payroll records do not match the Card-Krueger data. Only a handful come anywhere close."
<p>
Several newspapers across the country, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have published EPI's findings. But despite several attempts by EPI to point out the flaws of the Card-Krueger study to the Times, America's newspaper of record has not yet acknowledged the Institute's findings.
<p>
John Doyle of EPI tells MediaNomics that "it was a real surprise when -- after the study was proven to be based on flawed data, and as a result, worthless -- the New York Times ignored our repeated efforts to publicize the study's flaws. This was not a critique of just another economic study. We pulled the underpinning from the administration's efforts to hike the minimum wage."
Perhaps the Times is just waiting for the right news peg.

<title>Reporters Still Ignoring the Real Tax Record of the 1980s</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Tax and Pretend about Budget Deficit</h2>
</center>
<p>
Here we go again. With Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole pondering a large tax cut proposal, many in the media are telling their viewers and readers that cutting taxes is inimical to balancing the budget.
<p>
"When you talk about a balanced budget and then you talk about big tax cuts, that's smoke and mirrors," argued NBC's Tim Russert, questioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the June 2 Meet the Press. "Bob Dole has been searching for a campaign issue that will mark clear-cut differences between himself and Mr. Clinton," stated ABC's Peter Jennings on the June 3 World News Tonight. But with taxes, "has Mr. Dole painted himself into a corner?" A week later, on the June 10 show, Jennings asked Dole in an interview: "Cutting taxes or the budget deficit, how can you do both?"
<p>
That doing both is impossible has been an article of faith for reporters for years. 
<p>
Since the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, reporters have repeatedly blamed budget deficits on tax cuts. In 1989 and 1990 they scolded George Bush for promising not to raise taxes and urged him to change his mind. On July 18, 1989, CBS Evening News reporter Mark Phillips, for instance, referred to "the stubborn budget deficit that most economists say will never be seriously reduced without the new taxes to which the President [Bush] remains opposed." 
<p>
"We cannot simply sidestep what is happening by resorting to old ideologies and new slogans," stated Mortimer Zuckerman in the February 6, 1989 U.S. News & World Report. Asked Zuckerman: "Who wants to read Bush's lips when to do so in the face of gigantic budget deficits means the slow decline of the America we know and believe in?" And correspondent Richard Threlkeld, on the October 16, 1990 CBS Evening News, opined: "So if and when they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they avoided in the `80s."
<p>
But are tax cuts really such bad policy? Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out in the May 27 Washington Times that when tax cut detractors are "asked for evidence that the American people suffered from [President] Reagan's tax cut, they have none to offer except the budget deficit."
<p>
This is a spurious argument, Bartlett maintains. "In fact, the tax cut had nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in federal budget deficits in the 1980s. On average, federal receipts as a share of GDP were higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s -- 19.0 percent of GDP versus 18.5 percent." According to Bart-lett, the deficit increase was caused by massive spending increases, with outlays increasing from 20.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 23.1 percent in the 1980s.
<p>
Bartlett demonstrates that real economic growth averaged 3.9 percent per year between 1982 and 1989, more than double the average for the 1990s. He also points out that "real median family income increased by $4,564 between 1982 and 1989, an increase of 12.6 percent, while it has fallen by $2,108, a decline of 5.2 percent in the low deficit 1990s."
<p>
If, as is most likely to be the case, tax cuts become part of the debate in this year's campaign, reporters should at least be skeptical of those who claim that they inevitably lead to higher deficits and other dreary economic outcomes.

<title>Issue Analysis: Are Some Risky Products More Newsworthy Than Others?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories</h2>
</center>
<p>
The following is adapted from a Media Research Center special report, to be released later this summer, about news media coverage of risky products and the companies which make and sell them:
<p>
It is estimated that about 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related illnesses.
<p>
It is also estimated that about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illnesses. And studies show that fully one-third of Americans (75 million) are overweight.
<p>
Given these statistics, it's reasonable to assume that there are three news stories about dietary fat and the industries that sell products with dietary fat for every four news stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, right?
<p>
Wrong. Media Research Center analysts counted every evening news story during the first six months of 1996 that had to do with tobacco and every evening news story during the same period that had to do with obesity and dietary fat. (Shows analyzed were ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's The World Today, and NBC Nightly News.) There were 138 stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, all of which portrayed tobacco as a risky product. There were only 38 stories about dietary fat and obesity which portrayed fat as risky to consumers, a difference of almost four to one.
<p>
It's hard to escape the conclusion that tobacco has been singled out. Unlike fat, no angle of tobacco or of the tobacco industry went uncovered during the study period. There were reports, for example, about increases in teen smoking. NBC's Brian Williams, introducing a January 25 Nightly News story, told of  "a disturbing report out today on teenage smoking from the Centers for Disease Control. Despite all the pressures to stop, all the attempts to restrict cigarette sales, kids in much of this country are picking up the habit faster than ever." According to NBC's Bob Kur, in the same story, "Teenagers are part of 47 million smokers nationwide whose habit costs the country $50 billion in medical care." Bill Clinton's anti-tobacco photo-ops were also popular news stories. ABC's Peter Jennings, on the May 7 World News Tonight, reported that "President Clinton was in a New Jersey classroom warning that 3,000 teenagers start to smoke every day."
<p>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. This was especially the case when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed that, for some people, smoking isn't addictive. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<p>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27 CBS Evening News told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On that same night, NBC's Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." 
<p>
There were also a great many stories about former tobacco industry executives and scientists admitting that they had known all along that nicotine is addictive, and numerous lawsuits against the tobacco industry were deemed of enough national importance to make the evening news.
<p>
In contrast, there were far fewer stories about fat and obesity and the industries which help produce them. Should tobacco really warrant so many more stories than fat? How dangerous is obesity? According to reporters themselves, it is quite dangerous. NBC's Tom Brokaw said, on the April 29 Nightly News, that "obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country. It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS's Jacqueline Adams, on the April 9 CBS Evening News, reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<p>
Even one high-fat meal can be dangerous, according to ABC's John McKenzie. On the May 9 World News Tonight, McKenzie told viewers about a study conducted at the University of Maryland in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<p>
So why so much more attention to the tobacco industry than to industries that produce fat? There were never any heated stories on the evening news about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. There were no reporters monitoring the political donations of fast-food restaurant chains and their trade associations. There were no stories in which reporters asked food-industry executives if they believed their products to be harmful. And there were no stories pointing out the medical-care costs of obesity.
<p>
Either the network evening news shows spend too much time covering tobacco or not enough covering the dangers of obesity and dietary fat. Either way, one politically incorrect product and industry is being singled out for intensive news coverage while other risky products and the industries which produce them are not.

<title>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</title>

<center><h2>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</h2>
</center>
<p>
All this year MediaNomics has reported on how the TV networks have overhyped the economic insecurity of American workers. A March study, for instance, showed that there had been 19 stories in the first two months of the year about layoffs, but only two about job growth. The June issue reported on how the media were ignoring an Inc. magazine\Gallup poll showing that most workers are quite secure and happy.
<p>
Finally, some reporters are starting to question the layoff legend. "The fears," said Forest Sawyer, in his introduction to a July 3 World News Tonight story, "are not always supported by the facts." 
<p>
Robert Krulwich, an economics correspondent for ABC News, continued: "Because we read every day about corporate layoffs and corporate downsizing and job anxiety, most of us now believe the world has changed...[but] what we all think is happening is not." According to Krulwich, "We Americans stay at our jobs about as long as we did 20 years ago. If you go back to 1973 to see how many folks had been at the same company for 10 years or more, for the younger group it was 28.8 percent and for the older group it was 45.1 percent. Now let's go forward to 1993, and look at this, the percentages are up, but very slightly. No big change at all."
<p>
He quoted Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University: "And so what this is telling me is that there is basically just about as much job stability now as there was 20 years ago."
<p>
But then Krulwich tried to explain why people seem to feel more insecure now than they did in past decades. "Here's one possible explanation," Krulwich ventured. "Yeah, lots of people left jobs in 1973; lots of people left jobs in 1993. The numbers look the same...[but] there is some evidence that back in the 1970s more people happily quit their jobs for better pay, whereas today more people get fired." According to Krulwich, "Today people may stay at their jobs because they are afraid of losing their health insurance or their benefits, so they are stuck. Back then people maybe stayed on their jobs because they liked them."
<p>
This explanation conflicts, however, with the Inc. poll, which showed that 70 percent think management makes their workplaces great places to work, that 84 percent had opportunities to grow and learn at work, and that almost 70 percent thought they were paid fairly. This is not the picture of an unhappy work force.
<p>
While his diagnosis of worker attitudes may have been suspect, kudos to Krulwich for reporting the facts about job tenure.

<title>Labor Money Is OK</title>

<center><h2>Labor Money Is OK</h2></center>
<p>
Jackie Judd's report on the June 14 ABC World News Tonight warned of the close-knit nature of the relationships between, as anchor Peter Jennings put it, "politicians and the industries they are supposed to oversee." So far, so good. But their look at the ties of big business overlooked another group: Big Labor. 
<p>
Jennings introduced Judd's report: "Many politicians still like to wine and dine and travel on somebody else's tab." Judd focused on Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Republican Senator Larry Pressler, and House Republican Pat Roberts, who all accepted free travel from industries for which they chair committees. Of Hollings, Judd said: "As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he took half a dozen trips courtesy of industries his committee oversees." And of Roberts, Judd said: "The American Crop Association hosted him at the swanky Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, and the Dairy Foods Association flew Roberts to Miami for a four day trip."
<p>
Judd's findings were worthy of reporting, but she didn't go far enough. As with most stories about the influence of money in politics, Judd's only looked at business. Labor groups also finance junkets for those in Congress and spend lavishly on campaigns, but viewers were left in the dark about their activities. 
<p>
Judd also didn't ponder why industry finds it necessary to lobby in the first place: often to defend their turf from encroaching government power. What Judd sees as industry's cozy cronyism may be simply a method of survival in a regulatory age.

<center><h2>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</h2></center>
<p>
Reporters ignore actual donations, label conservatives as industry-backed
A burden of being a free market think tank or activist group in Washington must be knowing that TV network news typically ignores your work. What may be almost as bad is when network reporters cite the work of your free market group, but then sully its credibility by labeling the group "industry-supported."
<p>
It doesn't seem to matter to TV reporters that groups supporting expanded government policies actually receive more funding from corporations than do many of the free market think tanks. Nor does it seem to occur to reporters that some corporations may like, and profit from, big government policies more than from a free market.
<p>
Take CBS' Eric Engberg. On the June 21 CBS Evening News, Engberg reported on the efforts of conservatives in Congress to "defund the left," or stop the federal government from subsidizing the lobbying efforts of liberal advocacy groups. According to Engberg: "Right-leaning advocacy groups would be largely untouched by the legislation because they receive little federal aid and often have deep-pocketed backers in the business world."
<p>
Engberg failed to point out that many of the liberal groups which receive government money in fact have business backers with deeper pockets than those of most conservative groups. According to Stuart Nolan of the Capital Research Center, "Popular opinion incorrectly ties conservatives to big business, while liberals claim the moral high ground by championing 'the little guy.' In truth, however, big business tends to support conservative nonprofits only on legal issues and, to a lesser degree, on regulatory ones. Corporate America tends to fund liberals who specialize in women's, family, minority, and environmental issues."
<p>
According to Nolan's research, Corporate America donates over three times more to left-of-center groups than to right-of-center groups. Examples: AT&T financially supports such liberal groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).
<p>
And Times Mirror supports the Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Urban League, and Planned Parenthood. Yet none of these industry supported groups are labeled as such by reporters. 
Conservative groups aren't so lucky. The latest example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a free market environmental group. While CEI does receive some of its funding from corporations, so do liberal environmental organizations, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. That didn't stop two CBS reporters from placing only CEI in the same boat as "industry."
<p>
On the May 30 CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver (and Bill Plante on the May 31 This Morning), after reviewing President Clinton's objections to revisions of the Clean Water Act, referred to "industry groups and their supporters" before running a soundbite from CEI's Fred Smith. While Braver and Plante should be commended for interviewing Smith, liberal environmentalists who get more money from industry than CEI have escaped such labeling.
<p>
Industry is not a monolith. Some businesses support and prosper from free markets. Others do not and give money to groups which favor government activity in the marketplace. By missing this point, reporters unfairly tilt credibility against the think tanks and advocacy groups which support free markets in favor of those which do not.

<title>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</h2></center>
<p>
NBC correspondent uncovers angles other Washington reporters miss
For some time now, NBC's Lisa Myers has been one of the most perceptive network news reporters based in Washington. Her beat is politics, but she brings to that calling an economics perspective which even some of the most seasoned business reporters lack.
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, Myers has spent most of her time covering the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. She has been no knee-jerk partisan of the GOP. Often she challenges Hill leaders for practicing the same kind of old-fashioned politics they had claimed to repudiate in the November elections.
On the March 14 Nightly News, for instance, Myers took House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston to task for directing pork spending into his and other committee members' districts. "Bob Livingston preaches budget cutting with the fervor of a televangelist," Myers reported. "When critics charged that cuts victimized the poor, Livingston argued that the real victims today are taxpayers." 
<p>
But, she said, "he and his committee seem less concerned about reaching into taxpayers' pockets when it comes to their own pork barrel projects." After pointing out the nearly $3 billion Appropriations Committee members had steered to their own districts, Myers said the policy, though started by Democrats, "runs contrary to promises that this Republican Congress would be different."
On the May 23 Nightly News her target was Senatorial junkets. She described one junket in which five senators flew to Bali to visit a bamboo training center. She criticized both Republicans and Democrats, namely Senators Bennett Johnston, Alan Simpson, and self-proclaimed fiscal conservative Arlen Specter. She also detailed the extensive travels of one Congressman, supposedly to learn more about foreign policy issues, even though he sits on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
<p>
In contrast to many other political reporters in Washington, Myers also turns a skeptical eye toward many popular government programs. President Bill Clinton's pet program, Americorps, has received extremely favorable coverage from other networks. But Myers, on the February 16 Nightly News, looked at the facts. "Everyone agrees that what these young people are doing is worthwhile," Myers said. "The issue is whether it's a smart use of taxpayers' money. Critics insist it's not, that it's the last gasp of big government liberalism."
<p>
She pointed out that "an environmental project in Alaska costs taxpayers $42,000 per volunteer per year" and also that a grant of "$140,000 [went] to Northeastern University, [but] not a penny went for volunteers." She challenged a bureaucrat who helps run the program, finding that "even a top supervisor described Americorps as a jobs program," which "is not the way the Clinton Administration sold it to Congress."
<p>
On the May 25 Nightly News, Myers examined the federal government's program to subsidize America's sugar growers. According to her, "The sugar secret is hidden in many of your favorite foods: candy, cereal, even canned hams. The sugar growers like it that way. They get billions of dollars; you pay inflated prices and don't even know it, which is one reason the sugar program is one of the sweetest deals around."
<p>
Myers explained that "government price supports and import restrictions combine to drive up the cost of sugar in this country. This year the world price of sugar is 14 cents a pound. But U.S. growers get 22 cents a pound." She pointed out that the total cost to consumers is $1.4 billion a year and that most of the benefits go to large corporate sugar farmers rather than small family farmers.
<p>
On the June 13 Nighty News, Myers proved unafraid to investigate one of the most powerful lobbying forces for big government in America -- the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). "If you think the AARP is some frail group of old people," she reported, "think again. In reality the AARP is one of the most influential voices in [Washington], trusted by 33 million members who are powerful because they vote as a bloc." She pointed out that most AARP money comes not from dues but from selling and endorsing products.
<p>
"However, an NBC News analysis found that while these products and endorsements are good business for the AARP," Myers said, "they are not always good deals for its members." She interviewed experts in such fields as investment banking and health insurance who told viewers that the AARP-sponsored products are usually not the best on the market and are overpriced because of the fee the AARP receives for products sold.
<p>
But it's Myers health care reporting which especially distinguishes her from many of her colleagues. While her beat is politics, and she therefore focuses on political angles, Myers nevertheless consistently brings up important economic facts which other reporters -- even economics reporters -- miss. In the previous Congressional term, for instance, when the Clinton Administration was proposing a sweeping health care program and assuring Americans that it knew how much the program would grow over the years, Myers looked at history and was skeptical.
<p>
On the September 29, 1993 Nightly News, Myers said: "When LBJ proposed [Medicare] he claimed it would cost $8 billion in 1990. The actual cost was $98 billion. Many health experts and economists are already challenging key assumptions of the Clinton plan."
<p>
The only other network reporter to point out the poor track record of government health care estimates, and how the government always underestimates rather than overestimates costs, was CBS's Ray Brady.
<p>
When, last year, the Democrats' favorite health care soundbite was that each American should get the same extravagant medical coverage as members of Congress, Myers kept her eye on the ball. On the June 21, 1994 Nightly News, she asked about such rhetoric: "And who will pay? One way or another, you will." 
<p>
And on this year's hottest health care issue, Medicare reform, Myers has again provided unique insights. The root problem of Medicare, according to Myers, is that "elderly Americans are getting far more in benefits than they ever paid in taxes. Fact: The average man retiring today will have paid about $24,000 in Medicare taxes and will get $85,000 in benefits. For women, who live longer, the difference is even greater: $25,000 in taxes compared with $104,000 in benefits." She is, so far, the only network reporter to point out the large disparities.
<p>
Myers, however, is no ideologue. In 1992 she gave less than charitable coverage to both Republican Presidential candidates, George Bush ("Even judged by the words of his own inaugural address, he comes up short.") and Pat Buchanan ("Pat Buchanan leads with anger."). She also has been critical of Republican plans to cut taxes and reform welfare. 
<p>
She is, above all, fair. She regularly does what good Washington reporters should, but don't usually, do: take skeptical looks at not just "waste," but at the programs government claims to run well, and remember that there are usually economic facts underneath every political story.

<title>Repeating NIH Press Releases</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Repeating NIH Press Releases</center></h2>
<p>
A widely circulated Washington Fax, published and edited by Bradie Metheny, confirms what many suspected: reporters often frame government spending stories along the lines of the press releases of the agencies affected. The fax noted that representatives of and those associated with the National Institutes of Health admit openly they manipulated media coverage to save funding for their agency. 
<p>
"Between May 7 and May 25," the fax reported, "biomedical research was featured in seven network news shows. ABC's Prime Time Live did a story on why funding for seemingly esoteric basic research is key to future advances in medicine. And on PBS, talk show host Charlie Rose interviewed researcher Paul Marks about the implications of the proposed cuts at NIH."
<p>
This same type of "if government doesn't do it who will" mentality was also prevalent in print media. According to the fax: "The New York Times editorial and Op-Ed pages both featured commentaries supporting a strong federal investment in biomedical research and science in general and condemning Republican budget proposals in this area. The Times also had a front-page story May 22 that said basic research was at risk in the battle over balancing the budget."
<p>
How did NIH manage such favorable coverage? "Much of the media activity was due to the efforts of the scientific community to focus attention on the budget cuts threatening NIH," reported the authors of the fax. "The New York Times coverage, for example, was in no small measure due to a lengthy phone call made from Washington state to the Times' board of editors by Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges."
<p>
The moral of the story: Public relations departments drive the news. Those wanting to cut government spending need to start working the phones.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</title>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</center></h2>
<p>
Reporters Rail Against Legal Reform
<p>
Most observers of the media will agree that if there is one group to which almost all reporters are partial, it's victims. Reporters are eager to cover those who have been injured wrongfully or who have suffered injustices. Such profiles are commonplace in stories about nearly every political issue and often send powerful signals to viewers and readers about which side of an issue deserves sympathy.
<p>
Often this biases stories against free market policies. It is easy, after all, to interview those who get government benefits and who will, at least in the short term, suffer if the benefits are reduced. It's not as easy to interview a young person whose future is being mortgaged to pay for the government programs.
<p>
Current Congressional efforts to reform the U.S. legal system, therefore, present the media with an exceptional opportunity to be balanced. There are clear, identifiable victims on both sides of the tort reform issue. On the anti-reform side are those who have been harmed by a defective product and for whom the courts may be the only redress.
<p>
On the pro-reform side are the small business owners who have been forced to lay off workers or even go out of business because of frivolous lawsuits; as well as small business owners who have caved in to settlement demands in frivolous cases because they could not afford to defend themselves in court.
Despite this clear opportunity, reporters dropped the ball. Media- Nomics analysts reviewed every story about legal reform on each TV network's evening newscast during the first five months of this Congress. While reporters more than adequately covered the plights of those who have had to sue companies because of defective products, they did not interview or focus on a single small business owner or other victims of frivolous lawsuits. Reporters were also completely uninterested in exploring the economic costs of the current legal system.
<p>
Of the 19 legal reform stories that aired, eleven focused on neutral facts about recent Congressional action on legal reform, eight were explicitly critical of such reforms, and no story was critical of the status quo. Six of the eight stories critical of reform described how the status quo helps victims of defective products or medical malpractice. None probed how the status quo may hurt those who are targets of frivolous lawsuits.
<p>
The soundbites were similarly skewed. No business owner, small or large, was interviewed for a soundbite; only two representatives of business associations were interviewed. Five lawyers, by contrast, were interviewed for soundbites, as were four representatives of trial lawyers associations and five representatives of self-described consumer groups. Six stories carried soundbites from victims of defective products; none carried soundbites from victims of frivolous lawsuits. No story featured an interview with an economist, who could have told viewers of the economic benefits of legal reform.
<p>
Bob Faw's May 2 NBC Nightly News story was typical. "62-year-old sheet metal worker Ben Jones was a victim, not just of cancer, but of medical malpractice," Faw reported. "Four years ago doctors at this Fort Worth hospital bungled. Instead of removing Jones' cancerous left lung, they removed his healthy right lung." According to Faw, "The doctors also lied about what they had done and by the time Jones found out, it was too late. He died painfully and unnecessarily."
<p>
Faw interviewed the victim's widow, son, and attorney, plus a member of the American Medical Association (AMA). While the AMA member did point out that much of the money from malpractice awards goes to lawyers, Faw nonetheless concluded by wondering if "efforts to reign in lawyers will end up hurting the Jones'."
<p>
Similarly, on the March 10 CBS Evening News, Art Rascon profiled the case of a Florida boy who because of doctors' mistakes has been in a vegetative state for the past ten years. Because of a Florida law stating that damage awards over $200,000 must be approved by the state legislature, Rascon explained, the boy's family hasn't received any money. "So little Justin still lies in bed," Rascon concluded, "the victim of not only a tragic medical mistake, but of a legal and political system that has yet to resolve the fate of this 11-year-old boy."
<p>
One reporter, ABC's Tim O'Brien, seemed especially hostile to reform. On the March 7 World News Tonight, O'Brien downplayed worries of a litigation explosion and said that "making the loser pay the winner's legal expenses may reduce the number of lawsuits, but most consumer groups insist only the wealthy could sue." O'Brien only interviewed representatives of the Association of Trial Lawyers and of Consumer Action.
<p>
Two days later, on the March 9 World News Tonight, O'Brien again interviewed a narrow range of sources, this time only a representative of Public Citizen, a consumer group backed by trial lawyers. O'Brien and his source, Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook, tried to play down the abuse of punitive damages in product liability lawsuits.
<p>
According to O'Brien most of the large awards which make headlines are later reduced on appeal. "Consumer groups insist the mere threat of punitive damage awards benefits the public," O'Brien said. He never gave the other side: The mere threat of punitive damages also causes many wrongfully accused firms to settle cases because it's cheaper than litigating, even if they win.
<p>
On the March 13 World News Tonight, O'Brien focused on what effect legal reform would have on malpractice lawsuits. His story focused on Willie King, a patient who had the wrong foot amputed by doctors. Viewers heard from King, his attorney, and the president of the Trial Lawyers of America. Said O'Brien: "[King's] lawyer says Congress should be making doctors more accountable for mistakes, not less."
<p>
Missing from O'Brien's story was, for instance, an economist who could have told viewers that large malpractice awards cause everyone's insurance rates to go up. Reporters in general ignored economists who could have informed viewers of the economic benefits which most experts think legal reform would usher in.
No one on either side of the debate would argue that those injured by faulty products shouldn't have the right to seek redress in court; and Faw, Rascon, and O'Brien were not wrong to focus attention on such victims. 
<p>
But legal reform is a complex issue. As with most other political issues, the economic ramifications of legal reform have not been explored by reporters. And anecdotes about victims of defective products and services were not balanced by reports on another set of victims whose stories need to be told: the wrongfully accused small business owners who are often hurt by the current system. Viewers need to know that there are victims on both sides of the legal reform issue if they are to be well-informed.

<Title>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</Title>

<center><h2>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</h2>
</center>
<p>
Ray Brady, CBS's economics correspondent, would be a great economics analyst -- if this were the 19th century. For Brady the only good job is manufacturing job. His rhetoric would have you think that service jobs are something akin to slavery, with most of the jobs created since the 1980s being for hamburger flippers. This vastly underestimates the power of the late- 20th century American economy to create good service jobs.
<p>
On the July 7 CBS Evening News, Brady reported on a drop in the unemployment rate that "on the surface, it looks like good news, but if you dig into the numbers, they're really not that great." Why? Because "we're losing manufacturing jobs, which are high paying, and we're adding amusement park kinds of jobs, which don't pay much."
<p>
This is nothing new for Brady, who has been bashing service jobs for years. On March 10, 1989, he reported that "in today's figures, the big job increase is in low-paying service industry jobs" while a graphic of a teen flipping burgers was on the screen. Good employment news on September 4, 1992 was tempered by losses in "manufacturing, the industry that's the heartbeat of the economy."
<p>
On March 5, 1993, Brady reported that "there was hardly any growth in high paying manufacturing jobs," only in service jobs, which "don't pay what the old jobs did." And on March 4, 1994, Brady reported that despite a drop in unemployment, "still, the biggest winners came in low-paying service jobs."
<p>
But just how bad are service jobs. According to National Review's Ed Rubenstein, service jobs include "positions in law, advertising, computers, and medicine." During the 1980s, he reported, "only 12 percent of the increase in employment occurred in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations such as retailing and fast-food restaurants." And what about the 1990s? According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the January 30 Nightly News, "The Census Bureau today said that [computer] software is by far the fastest growing part of the service economy."
<p>
So Brady and other reporters should take a good look at the wide range of service jobs before stereotyping them as "amusement park kinds of jobs." Most of the new service workers do just fine.

<Title>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </h2>
</center>
<p>
Journalists don't question Administration officials' defense of business pork 
The corporate welfare state has found presumably unwitting allies in the media. Despite the Clinton Administration's stated policy of being against federal subsidies for business, reporters haven't challenged Administration officials to explain their defense of business pork against budget cutters.
<p>
CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4 World News reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block." 
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." He didn't ask Farmer if this made USTTA an example of corporate welfare. Bierbauer concluded his segment by saying that "tourists will continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
Another network reporter who let corporate welfare go unchallenged was John Roberts, who warned, on the June 25 CBS Evening News, of federal summer job programs being hurt by Republican budget cuts. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment."  Concluding his story, Roberts said: "[Labor Secretary Robert] Reich points out that one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs."
<p>
But, if that's the case, isn't a federal program that forces taxpayers to subsidize the training costs of businesses a prime example of corporate welfare, which Reich claims to oppose? Roberts didn't ask the Labor Secretary. 
<p>
A July 2 Washington Post story lacked similar insights. "Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence 'cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress," according to the Post.
<p>
"As Commerce Secretary, Brown has made U.S. exports a cornerstone of his department, leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets." The Post quoted Brown: "It's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the Cabinet table."
<p>
The Post didn't speculate that the Commerce Department may itself embody corporate welfare. Nor did the Post give any non-Administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "The current management of the Department boasts that it is especially effective in using its vast resources to help individual companies succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," Weidenbaum said in his testimony to the House Commerce Committee.
<p>
"Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum said. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair." According to Weidenbaum, most American businesses and the American economy would be better off if the money spent by the Commerce Department went to lower taxes or reduce the deficit.
<p>
Remarkably, reporters who were quick to publicize the Administration's crusade to end corporate welfare aren't suspicious when the same Administration claims it can help private companies create jobs and train employees.

<center><h2>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</h2>
</center>
<p>
The concerns of small business owners rarely make it into the stories of the Washington media (See page 2). A notable exception: the July 17 Washington Post. Staff writer Jay Matthews, in a front page story, describes how the federal regulatory maze causes one small business, the Drypers Corporation, to "fear" and "shudder" at the cost of compliance. According to Matthews, that fear can now be remedied by "a Republican led Congress [that] tries to rewrite and scale back what businesses consider irrational intrusions." Matthews gives readers a "close look at Drypers' multi-layered relationship with Washington [which] helps explain the resentment that drives this [deregulatory] campaign."
<p>
The story quotes Walter Klemp, chairman of the Texas-based diaper company, as fearing almost any new government action. Referring to the last time Congress changed tax laws, he asks: "How many volumes and rooms of tax code did they add to the whole thing the last time?" Matthews notes that "Drypers must calculate its income in one way for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and its shareholders and in quite another way for the [Internal Revenue Service]." Other "conflicting rules" which "almost no one reads" include "a federal law that requires a plan to reduce its employees' commuting time while a state law says the company does not have to put the plan into effect." Such conflicting rules require Drypers' management to neglect their "families for weeks to produce stacks of reports," causing Klemp to declare that "government has tried too much to work social issues through business."
<p>
While Matthews didn't point out the cost of excessive regulations for consumers and society (See Editor's Note, page 8), kudos to him and the Post for reporting on how overregulation does hurt small, struggling business owners.
<p>
 MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued. Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers get billions in subsidies.
<p>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by its founders.
<p>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy entitlements debate.

<title>Reporters Ignore Those Who Support Tax Cuts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Economists Unanimous on Taxes? </h2>
</center>
<p>
Reporters seem to think they have found something others have been trying to find for years -- a consensus among economists.  Journalists in both the print and broadcast media are reporting that "most economists" are against Dole's tax cuts. But a recent study that actually surveyed economists finds much less agreement than the media are conveying.
<p>
"Bob Dole says his new economic plan will carry America `to the threshold of a breathtaking future.' But to many economists, it looks like `Back to the Future,'" wrote the Boston Globe's Peter G. Gosselin on August 6. "For all Dole's claims about the innovativeness of his proposal analysts said that it relies on two tried-and-troubled ideas -- spending cuts like those balked at by the public last year, and an economic payoff largely missing from the nation's last experiment with substantial tax cuts under Ronald Reagan."
<p>
Clay Chandler, in the August 6 Washington Post, agreed: "Economists, investors and budget experts yesterday questioned the validity of those assumptions and the budget numbers underlying Dole's ambitious claims." He quoted Norwest Corp.'s chief economist, Song Won Sohn, as saying, "If we were to put in a package like this, I'm concerned that income growth effects would be negative, not positive."
<p>
Broadcast reporters were equally adamant. NBC's David Bloom, on August 5, said: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
<p>
It turns out not to be so clear, though. Professor William C. Adams of George Washington University conducted a nationwide survey of 700 members of the American Economics Association. According to Adams, the survey found "an unexpected degree of sympathy for tax cuts" as well as "an enormous diversity of opinion and no profession-wide consensus on these key issues." (See box.)
<p>
About the same percentage of economists, for instance, think federal spending caused the increased deficits of the 1980s (52) as think Reagan's tax cuts were the culprit (48). More than eight out of ten, though, agree that Reagan's tax cuts increased economic growth. A sizable minority of economists (41 percent) think Dole's plan to recapture 30 percent of the revenue lost from his tax cut through faster economic growth -- the classic supply-side argument -- is plausible. 
<p>
According to the survey, the closest thing to a consensus among economists concerns reining in spending. When asked their preferred priorities for the next Congress, a plurality (42 percent) picked cutting taxes and restraining spending. Thirty four percent chose restraining spending. In other words, a full 76 percent favor restraining spending, a story still waiting to be told in the news.

<title>Issue Review: Coverage of Business Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Schizophrenic on Corporate Welfare</h2>
</center>
<p>
When General Colin Powell, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, challenged his party to rein in corporate welfare and not just other parts of government, reporters responded approvingly. But a look at their own past record in coverage (or lack of coverage) of subsidies to business and industry reveals that reporters themselves need to start challenging both parties on the issue.
<p>
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin Powell's speech," commented MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, "is that he did talk about the hard choices and he said, `Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have to give up corporate welfare as well.'" PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to the Family Research Council's Gary Bauer: "You heard the reaction in the room at the conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you think this crowd is really receiving this message?"
<p>
As important is how the media have received this message. For while they are interested in corporate welfare now, the real deafening silence has been in the media's coverage of business subsidies. As reported by MediaNomics in past issues, reporters over the last several months have often either ignored corporate welfare when it was a major part of a prominent issue, or they have actually promoted business subsidies.
<p>
Example: Last summer when some budget cutters in Congress were trying to cut business pork, reporters came to the rescue. CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4, 1995 World News, reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described the USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block."
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, undersecretary of commerce, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." Is the USTTA corporate welfare? Bierbauer didn't ask. Bierbauer's conclusion: "Tourists may continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
John Roberts, on the June 25, 1995 CBS Evening News, warned that budget cuts may hurt summer jobs programs. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low-income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment." Roberts quoted Labor Secretary Robert Reich as pointing out that "one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs." So does taxpayer funding of businesses training costs constitute corporate welfare? Roberts didn't ask Reich.
<p>
A July 2, 1995 Washington Post story assumed the Commerce Department was necessary and didn't bother interviewing critics who were calling it the embodiment of corporate welfare. The entire story was from the point of view of then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. According to the Post, Brown, "a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence `cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress."
<p>
The Post said the secretary had been "leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets" and quoted Brown as saying that "it's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the cabinet table." The Post didn't give any space to non-administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum told the House Commerce Committee. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair."
<p>
Sometimes journalists simply ignored corporate welfare altogether, even when it was part of an issue they were covering. This past spring, for example, most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton Adminstration's expensive plan to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. The fact that federal subsidies, supported by both the Clinton Administration and Republicans in Congress, were propping up the same sugar industry which threatened the Everglades rarely merited a mention.
<p>
The Clinton plan is "the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever," cheered CBS News correspondent Art Rascon on the February 20 This Morning. Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 Newsweek, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." On February 20 reporter Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times called Clinton's plan "as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years."
<p>
But none of these reporters made the connection between the subsides provided to industry by the sugar tariff and damage to the Everglades. None asked why the government, before spending a lot of money, shouldn't just bring down the tariff. Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times criticized the subsidies. "The government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year," Schmitt pointed out. "Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
Such subsidies to business constitute some of the least defensible of federal spending programs. Although neither Republican nor Democratic politicians want to talk about corporate welfare, it has critics outside of Congress and the Clinton Administration on both the right and the left. Reporters generally cheered Colin Powell for bringing up corporate welfare in his convention speech. But when it comes to specific programs, they have usually been slow to mention corporate welfare's critics and quick to assume that business subsidies are justified.

<center><h2>Kudos: NBC's Lisa Myers and Andrea Mitchell</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the encouraging recent trends on the evening newscasts is the development of regular segments in which reporters explore how the government often misspends taxpayers' money. As recent coverage has demonstrated, NBC Nightly News' version, "The Fleecing of America," has proven to be one of the best.
<p>
The July 10 "Fleecing of America" segment told viewers how the Social Security Administration spends tax money for union representatives who, as Tom Brokaw said, "do no work on Social Security matters." According to correspondent Lisa Myers: "Taxpayers are paying the salaries of 146 full-time employees who do not work on Social Security matters and instead spend all of their time on union activities," as well as another 1,800 who spend part of their work time engaged in union tasks. Myers reported that "under President Clinton, the cost of these union activities has doubled to almost $13 million a year."
<p>
She interviewed former SSA employees who told of the union workers' using their jobs, and therefore tax money, to promote the Democratic Party, and confronted an SSA official about such partisan ties. "This is not happening just at the Social Security Administration," she concluded, "but in virtually every other federal agency."
<p>
Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, for the August 7 segment, told viewers about an "expensive new Medicare handbook, courtesy of the U.S. Government." According to Mitchell: "The handbook is supposed to describe Medicare benefits and where to get help, basic information. It cost $2.1 million to distribute last year. But this year, an election year, it cost nine times as much -- $18 million."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "critics wonder, was the chief reason for this year's big cost increase politics." One of those critics, Rep. Bill Thomas, (R-Calif.) said, "The primary goal was to create a positive, warm feeling in an election year with taxpayers' dollars."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "a separate copy went to every American over 65. That's 37 million copies," which went even to married seniors whose spouses received a copy. She pointed out that, despite the high cost, the handbook didn't even mention one of the new programs Medicare recipients are eligible for and concluded that to many, "it reads like another chapter in the fleecing of America."
<p>
Kudos to Myers, Mitchell, and NBC for holding government to the same standards reporters have long held the private sector.

<title>Guest Review, by Linda E. Platts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Where Science Meets Politics</h2>
</center>
<p>
Science and technology are now major players in the public policy arena. While much of the media ignore the science behind many political issues, at least one show takes it on squarely. TechnoPolitics, a half-hour public television show, is helping its viewers make sense out of technical information and also see how the policies that evolve will affect their lives.
<p>
Hosted by James K. Glassman, a Washington Post columnist who also hosts CNN's Capital Gang Sunday, TechnoPolitics is designed to "distinguish the science from the politics in policy debates," according to the producers. Thus, it deals with issues such as electronic communications, air defense, fat substitutes, medical research, and global warming.
<p>
The show delves into one topic at length and then follows with a briefer look at two other subjects. Film clips provide background information usually followed by a debate by experts representing both sides of the issue.
<p>
What distinguishes TechnoPolitics from other shows dealing with topical issues is its willingness to air views that get short shrift elsewhere. In a recent show, the World Bank came under close scrutiny. It is supported by the American taxpayers to the tune of $789 million a year and relies on the American government to guarantee its loans. Glassman dug in with queries on the bank's hefty salaries, its new $314 million headquarters, and its often risky loans, which no private bank would consider.
<p>
For another show, TechnoPolitics tackled pornography on the Internet. One side weighed in with the view that children must be protected at all costs and government control is essential. The opposing side suggested parents should do their jobs, rather than allow the government to gain a foothold on the free flow of information over the Internet. Another emotionally charged issue tackled recently by TechnoPolitics was medical research using animals. News footage with an animal rights activist and a patient battling AIDS introduced the segment, then in the studio two scientists presented contradictory "scientific" evidence. There were no clear winners or losers in this debate, but it highlighted the complexity of making public policy about animal testing.
<p>
Whether the subject is a replacement for the F-16 or saving human lives, TechnoPolitics doesn't shy away from the hard issues. The joint strike fighter, for instance, is intended to meet the needs of all the military services, but the development time, as Glassman noted, stretched well into the next century. Even more attention to the costs behind the science would be a welcome addition.
<p>
The last segment of each show does not examine an issue so much as raise an interesting subject. A New York Times reporter told how alternative medicines can deter patients from seeking effective treatment from conventional sources. A writer from Scientific American explained that all great scientific discoveries have already been made and from now on we will just be refining the details. Interesting, yes, but there is no debate and viewers are left in limbo waiting for the point that is never made. TechnoPolitics might be better leaving these stories to another program and sticking with the clear, rapid exchange of views that distinguishes the earlier portions of the program.
<p>
TechnoPolitics is produced by the Blackwell Corporation in association with South Carolina Educational Television and it is distributed by the Public Broadcasting System. It is broadcast on 180 stations and reaches 40 of the top 50 markets. It airs on Sunday mornings in most markets.

<Title>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Don't</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit Chicken Hawks</h2>
</center>
<p>
Bob Dole pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent, balance the
budget, and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Toughminded
reporters believed none of it and shared their skepticism with
a national television audience,&quot; writes the Weekly Standard's
David Frum in the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<P>
But then, according to Frum, &quot;Two weeks later, the Democrats met in
convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth about
their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al Gore's
words, of wanting to `give health insurance ripoff artists a license
to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither
on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But
we won't let them.' Those remarks are blatantly untrue, both about
the Republican plans and about Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing.&quot;
<P>
Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax rhetoric
than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media Research Center
analysts reviewed all of the stories about either tax cuts or
Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's World Today during the month of August. The MRC's
findings: While network journalists were ardent deficit hawks
when reporting on tax cuts, they lost their deficitcutting zeal
when Democrats denounced Republican Medicare plans.There were
a total of 24 stories during the month that questioned whether
Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the budget. Only two
stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could erase the deficit
while not advancing Medicare reforms in his second term.The reaction
to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same across the networks.
&quot;Since Dole would leave Social Security, Medicare, and defense
untouched,&quot; reported CBS News correspondent Phil Jones, &quot;it's
still unclear what would be cut in order to pay for his tax cut.&quot;
According to CNN's Gene Randall, &quot;Bob Dole has produced an
economic plan that is getting mixed reviews even from Republicans.
The bipartisan Concord Coalition on Sunday warned against electionyear
taxcut Santas.&quot;
<P>
NBC's Mike Jensen offered that &quot;most
analysts say it's not good economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth
of the tax cuts would be paid for by an expanding economy, but
the rest would have to come from spending cuts, and those haven't
been spelled out yet.&quot; Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran
claimed that &quot;if critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to
budget deficits of the size of those dating back to the Reagan
era, then his campaign simply isn't going to worry about it for
now.&quot;
<P>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics
columnist Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post,
pointed out that in the upcoming years &quot;the only way to avoid
(or minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced benefits
and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On Medicare, the
Republicans proposed precisely such a shift...Clinton's demolition
of this effort confounds the CBO's sensible advice.&quot;
<P>
Only
two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare alone
could be compatible with balanced budgets. &quot;A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade,&quot; ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. &quot;So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit reductions
will be impossible to sustain.&quot; ABC's Jeff Greenfield reported
that &quot;with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in about
15 years, those entitlement programs could take every single dollar
of the budget.&quot;
<P>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters
concerned about how to &quot;pay for&quot; automatic Medicare
spending increases. If Bill Clinton won't reform Medicare in his
next term, why aren't reporters asking him which taxes he will
raise?

<Title>Issue Analysis: The Media Versus Tobacco</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories, Part II</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be lifethreatening,
or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For
America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former.
Over a recent twelvemonth period, television news has devoted
significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting
on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
This is one finding
of a special yearlong Media Research Center study of news coverage
of risky products and the industries which make and sell them.
Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage
by far than any other risky legal product, such as dietary fat
and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol
and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry.
Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media
obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well,
even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign. 
<P>
Media Research
Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky
products on network morning and evening news shows between August
1, 1995 and August 1, 1996. There were 413 stories during that
twelvemonth period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about
illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite welldocumented
rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few
years, notably among teenagers.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity
has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American
newspapers finds that the terms &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot;
were employed 26,546 times between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996. Over the same time period, the terms &quot;cocaine or
heroin or LSD or illegal drugs&quot; were used only 8,501 times.
In other words, there were more than three times as many stories
focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal
drugs.
<P>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the
map. Eightyfive of the television news tobacco stories were about
the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Almost all of the stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts
to regulate tobacco, portraying him as courageously taking on
a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced
on the August 11, 1995 Today that &quot;in a historic move the
Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and
has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers.&quot;
According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning,
&quot;President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness
smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures
today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco
lobby.&quot;
<P>
But when the issue was the increases in illegal drug
use, Clinton was mentioned only in 45 stories, and most of those
mentions were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The
same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that
government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the
young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal
drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media
that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how
much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the
print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals
that there were 4,057 stories between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996 that had &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot; in
the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the
story. Stories with the terms &quot;cocaine or heroin or LSD or
illegal drugs&quot; in the headline and a reference to Clinton
in the body of the story numbered 381.
<P>
This singling out of tobacco
had effects on 1996 campaign coverage. Normally, when a politician
radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance,
there were several evening news stories during the 1996 Republican
National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on
illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the
Republican vicepresidential candidate. &quot;
<P>
The quarterback became
the acrobat today,&quot; reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August
14, 1996 World News Tonight. &quot;Kemp was flipflopping on long
held positions.&quot; She noted that these changes &quot;left
at least one delegate here feeling abandoned&quot; and that &quot;Kemp's
change in position on these core issues fights the very image
that he's built for himself as an independent thinker.&quot; According
to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, &quot;Bob
Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts.
Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration.&quot;
Rather wondered: &quot;Isn't that, or is it, going to make it
more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?&quot;
<P>
But
these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice
President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In
his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that
his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his antitobacco
crusade. None of the network evening newscasts pointed out that
in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that &quot;throughout most
of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my
own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it.&quot; Apparently, politicians changing their positions
cannot go unpunished by the media unless they result in the politician
becoming an antitobacco zealot.
<P>
The disparity between tobacco and
other legal products was even greater. On television  during the
same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco
 there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; there were
94 stories about auto safety; there were only 58 stories related
to alcohol and health.As MediaNomics reported two months ago,
the disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary
fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates
who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the
U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000
deaths in the U.S. per year. Reporters acknowledged this risk.
&quot;Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country,&quot;
Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. &quot;It
is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like.&quot;
Other reporters pointed out that obesity during pregnancy can
cause birth defects and other serious problems in babies. One
reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one highfat
meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. But
there were still only onefourth the number of stories on obesity
and dietary fat as there were stories about tobacco. 
<P>
There was
also a different standard of judgment for the industries that
make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected
to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured.
There were no stories, for example, about fastfood advertising
enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day
kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical
costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the
campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol.
But all the networks were critical of tobacco advertising and
campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society
of smokingrelated illnesses.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some
perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more
stories on tobacco than on other legal, risky products, but they
have allowed Clinton to use smoking to deflect attention from
rising illegal drug use. Reporters should not ignore tobacco,
but they should not apply to it a harsher standard than they apply
to even illegal drugs.Editor's note: This issue analysis is adapted
from a longer Media Research Center special report about media
coverage of both legal and illegal risky products and the industries
which produce them.

<Title>Guest Editorial, by Laurence A. Jarvik</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>PBS: Already Commercial</h2>
</center>
<p>
In all of the heated debate about privatizing
public broadcasting, one observation has struck me most forcefully
about PBS: It is a fact seldom commented upon that many PBS shows
have had their roots firmly fixed in commercial soil from their
inception. Many of public television's bestknown offerings are
either transfers from the networks, adaptations from them (often
using the same personnel), or purchases (on a commercial basis)
from British television companies (including such forprofit competitors
of the BBC as Thames Television).
<P>
The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Report</I>, for
instance, was produced by a team from NBC News and resembled the
<I>Huntley-Brinkley</I> Report. Bill Moyers shuttled between PBS and <I>CBS
News</I>. William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> had run on RKO General
stations before moving to PBS. <I>Frontline's</I> first anchorwoman was
NBC News' Jessica Savitch. The American Experience was headed
by veteran Moyers' producers from CBS News. National Geographic
specials were simply moved from CBS. Ken Burns' The Civil War
was sponsored by General Motors.
<P>
Sesame Street was produced by the makers of CBS's Captain Kangaroo. British comedies like Monty
Python's Flying Circus were sold profitably to individual stations,
as were howto programs such as This Old House and The French Chef.
Masterpiece Theatre and Mystery! were brought to PBS by the Mobil
Corporation. The story of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose is
a case study of how private sponsorship made possible a major
PBS miniseries. 
<P>
One could choose a different selection of programs
to analyze, but it would be difficult to find truly excellent
PBS fare which did not have some commercial connection. It is
precisely these market forces which serve to improve the range,
quality, and choice of programs on public broadcasting.
<P>
The extent
to which public broadcasting had developed into a large, powerful,
and wealthy establishment over the past three decades remained
largely obscured from public view prior to 1992, when political
deliberation over continued funding for the system began in earnest.
As a result of the subsequent years of debate and disclosure there
is now a bipartisan consensus in Washington that public broadcasting
can be selfsupporting. In 1996 Congressman Jack Fields, chairman
of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced what
he called the &quot;Public Broadcasting SelfSufficiency Act.&quot;
Although I have opposed such a billiondollar final payment to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (as a &quot;trust fund&quot;),
no one has come forward to publicly argue against the principle
of selfreliance.
<P>
Indeed, a January 1996 public opinion survey commissioned
by CPB found broad support among the American public for PBS sales
of videotapes and merchandise, commercials, retail stores, online
computer services, and mailorder catalogs. Fiftyseven percent
of those asked said, &quot;The more sales the better.&quot; Eightysix
percent agreed that &quot;sponsorship announcements are okay because
public broadcasting has to do something to raise money in the
face of the decreased support from the federal government.&quot;
That is, the public now accepts that educational and cultural
programming on PBS can be successfully supported by private revenue
streams.
<P>
A system which began with a $5 million appropriation for
CPB in 1967 has grown over thirty years into a multibillion dollar
worldwide multimedia empire. With over a thousand public radio
and television stations, public broadcasting is now the largest
network in the United States. When judged by the number of stations,
National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, Pacifica,
and Public Radio International are bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC,
or ABC.
<P>
In addition to their on-air activities, public broadcasters
publish magazines and newsletters; provide computer programs,
online services, sites on the World Wide Web, study guides and
textbooks; host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing;
produce stage shows; sell products through mail order catalogs
and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.
From these activities a large industry has grown to parallel commercial
broadcasting. And, just like other telecommunications giants,
public broadcasting spends millions on public relations firms
and lawyers to lobby Congress.
<P>
The political issue of &quot;zeroing
out&quot; federal subsidies is no longer a matter of &quot;if&quot;
but merely a matter of &quot;when.&quot; For the evidence is clear
and convincing: public broadcasting does not need tax dollars
in order to do its job.

<CENTER><H2>Studies on Religion, Economy Available</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
The Media Research Center has produced a new landmark study of how news and 
entertainment television treat religion. Faith in a Box, 1994 builds on the 
1993 study of the same name, which found that religion received poor treatment 
in both the news and on prime time.
In the 1994 study, the MRC found marked improvement in Hollywood's depiction of 
religion, but network news continued to trivialize or downplay religious 
themes.
<P>
As was the case with its 1993 predecessor, Faith in a Box, 1994 was recently 
released to the media in Hollywood and Washington, and distributed to 
conservative and religious activists nationwide.
<P>
Leaders in the entertainment industry, including network executives, have been 
briefed on the MRC's findings as well, and given the MRC's recommendations on 
improving religious portrayals on their television shows.
<P>
To obtain a copy of Faith in a Box, 1994, please call 1-800-MRC-1423 or write 
to us at: Media Research Center, 113 S. West Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA

<P>
MediaNomics readers still have a chance to obtain Out of Focus: Network 
Television and the American Economy by MediaNomics editor Burton Yale Pines, as 
well.
<P>
Out of Focus takes an in-depth look at an entire year's network reporting on 
such as issues as health care reform, environmental policy, taxes, government 
spending, business, and consumer affairs. The book also looks into the impact 
of prime-time entertainment television on the culture of free enterprise and 
business.
<P>
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, "Out of Focus is a major blast at 
American network television. It deserves the attention of thinking Americans."
National Review agreed: "Out of Focus does for TV viewers what Consumer Reports 
does for car buyers, exposing the recurring flaws in the reports of Ray Brady, 
Irving R. Levine, most of the CNN staff, and the like."

<CENTER><H2>Letting Government Polluters off the Hook</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
For reporters, industry is always the polluter; government is always the 
protector. When it's government programs, such as subsidies for pesticide-using 
farmers, that encourage pollution, reporters are silent.
<P>
Robert Hager's August 8 NBC Nightly News story was a case in point. He began: 
"The purity of the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat. For two 
decades the Environmental Protection Agency has led the clean-up." From 
corporations pouring dioxin into the Great Lakes to protection of wetlands, 
"which prevent flooding and permit wildfowl to breathe." According to Hager, 
House efforts to rein in the EPA would bring "the first big slowdown in 
environmental clean-up since the 1970s."
<P>
But what if the government is the culprit? Take the Everglades. As Jonathan 
Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) points out, the U.S. sugar 
program, by subsidizing sugar production, is responsible for much of "the 
increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting the 
unique nature of the ecosystem." Tolman also lit into the USDA peanut program, 
which not only "costs consumers $500 million a year in higher peanut prices," 
but increases pesticide use by permitting peanuts to be grown in just a handful 
of counties.
<P>
Elimination of farm subsidies has been advocated by environmentalists of all  
political stripes, from the free-market CEI to the liberal Wilderness Society. 
Only reporters are letting government off the hook.

<CENTER><H3>Medicare Reporting Improving, But...</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In June, MediaNomics described how TV network news reporters were incorrectly 
characterizing Republican plans to slow the rate of Medicare's growth. During 
the study period, reporters called GOP plans "cuts" twice as often as they 
correctly called GOP plans "slowing Medicare's growth."
<P>
Since then, there has been a dramatic improvement in network labeling. Now, 
half of the time network reporters get it right labeling Medicare reform plans. 
Media-Nomics analysts reviewed all of the stories about Medicare on network 
evening newscasts from July 15 to August 15. In the 15 stories, there were 24 
references to either the GOP plan or the Clinton plan to reform Medicare. 
Twelve of the references labeled the plans "cuts" or "reductions." An equal 
number of references labeled the plans as slowing the rate of increase in 
Medicare.
<P>
There is, however, still some confusion. Many reporters now use the terms "cut" 
and "slow the growth" interchangeably, sometimes even in the same story. CNN's 
Catherine Calaway, for instance, on the July 25 World News, referred to 
Medicare "spending cuts," but then, two sentences later, said: "Both parties 
hope to slow Medicare growth, but Republicans would go further."
<P>
Her CNN colleague, Jill Dougherty, did the same four days later. On the July 29 
World News she reported on "Republican plans to cut the growth in Medicare 
spending," but then later in the story alluded to "the $270 billion in 
GOP-proposed cuts." On the next day's World News Dougherty again clouded the 
issue. After first reporting that "Republicans propose cutting Medicare's 
growth by $270 billion," she mentioned charges that "Republican cuts are just a 
cover for the $245 billion they want to give away in tax cuts." 
<P>
Later in the story she said the GOP was "intent on giving voters a balanced 
budget along with hefty tax cuts, and it's hard to see any way to do that 
without taking something out of Medicare."
<P>
The other networks were similarly sloppy. On the July 25 World News Tonight, 
for example, ABC reporter Rebecca Chase pointed out that "both parties propose 
slowing the growth of Medicare spending," but then later talked about how much 
they would "reduce" Medicare spending. At CBS, reporter Bob Orr said: 
"Republicans want to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $270 billion 
over the next seven years, more the double the $124 billion reduction proposed 
by the White House." But as he was saying this, viewers saw a graphic on screen 
with the same numbers, only under the headline "Proposed Medicare Cuts." 
Viewers presumably must have wondered if Medicare spending was being cut or 
merely slowed.
<P>
The most frequently mentioned number in network Medicare stories was $270 
billion -- the amount by which Republicans propose to slow the projected growth 
of Medicare. It was cited by ABC's Rebecca Chase and Bob Zelnick, CBS's Bob 
Orr, CNN's Jill Dougherty (twice), and NBC's Joe Johns (although Johns called 
it a cut, saying seniors were "angry over Republican plans to reduce Medicare 
spending $270 billion.").
<P>
According to ABC's Zelnick, for example: "Republicans want to cut $270 billion 
from projected cost increases during that time." These reports (except for 
Johns') were true, as far as they went. But they still gave the impression that 
reform meant fewer dollars for Medicare recipients. A clearer way of phrasing 
it would have been: "Republicans would allow the program to grow by $105 
billion over the next seven years instead of the projected $375 billion."
<P>
Only one reporter, CBS's Rita Braver, pointed out that spending per recipient 
would increase over the next seven years under the Republican plan. On the July 
25 CBS Evening News, after running soundbites from Democrat politicians calling 
on Republicans to keep their "greedy" hands off Medicare, Braver put things in 
perspective: "Republicans argue they don't want to cut Medicare, just control 
its growth, spending only $6,700 per capita instead of $8,000 per capita  in 
2002." A graphic on screen clearly showed that spending under the Republican 
plan would increase from $4,800 per recipient to $6,700 per recipient in 2002.
While reporters have improved the accuracy of their Medicare reform labels, 
there are still some of the same weaknesses in Medicare reports that 
MediaNomics identified three months ago. In soundbite selection, for example, 
reporters still overwhelming favor politicians over economists and others who 
could give non-political angles.
<P>
Twenty-five soundbites were from politicians (14 Democrats and 11 Republicans), 
as well as a story-length interview of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman 
by NBC's Brian Williams on the July 27 Nightly News. Only three soundbites, and 
no lengthy interviews, were from economists. And two of those were in one 
story, a July 27 Nightly News report by NBC's Lisa Myers.
<P>
And when it came to the views of ordinary Americans, most reporters seemed to 
agree with NBC's Brian Williams who claimed, on the July 29 Nightly News, that 
the elderly "would be most affected by GOP plans to fix the cost of Medicare." 
There were seven soundbites from elderly Americans who benefit from Medicare. 
There was only one soundbite -- again in Myers' July 27 story -- from someone 
younger who supports today's retirees while knowing they will get less support 
in their old age.
<P>
Only three of the 15 reports, in fact, covered more than the usual political 
angles of Medicare. One was Braver's July 25 CBS Evening News report mentioned 
earlier. She was the only reporter to point out just how much more will be 
spent per recipient under Republican plans. 
<P>
Another was a July 25 World News Tonight story by ABC's Rebecca Chase. She told 
viewers that "Medicare spending has gone from $7 billion [in 1970] to $159 
billion today." She added that "spending, now rising 10 percent a year, must be 
controlled, because in another 15 years the great wave of baby boomers, the 
largest generation ever, will be eligible for Medicare." No other reporter told 
of those numbers.
<P>
The most informative story was Myers' July 27 Nightly News report. She touched 
bases every other reporter missed, such as the fact that the average recipient 
will receive over $100,000 more in benefits than he or she paid in Medicare 
taxes and that the Johnson Administration was almost $100 billion short in its 
projection of what the cost would be in 1990. She also interviewed a Medicare 
expert, rather than just politicians, and a worker whose taxes support 
Medicare, rather than just elderly Medicare recipients.
<P>
But most of the network Medicare reporting, while improving, is still hamstrung 
by a narrow focus on the politics of the issue and an unwillingness to 
distinguish between a cut and slowed growth. If reporters want to help the 
public understand the continually explosive Medicare issue this fall, they will 
focus less on the politics of the issue and more on the numbers behind the 
crisis.

<CENTER><H3>Train Wreck or Fender Bender?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Washington is abuzz with talk of an impending budgetary "train wreck." To most 
Americans this conjures up the image of gruesome wreckage and bloody 
casualties. But the truth is that the budget train wreck should have little if 
any impact on the lives of ordinary Americans even if it forces a temporary 
shutdown of the federal government. The only forces that will collide in 
October will be the two competing philosophies of governance of a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress. Reporters should, therefore, be careful 
about calling the impasse a crisis.
<P>
To be precise, there are actually two potential budget train wrecks ahead. The 
first would occur if President Clinton vetoes any or all of the 13 
congressional appropriations bills. If spending programs have not received an 
appropriation before the start of the fiscal year on  October 1, then no money 
can be spent on the programs. Only "essential" functions, such as defense, law 
enforcement, and air traffic control, would continue to operate.
The second train wreck would occur if President Clinton vetoed the debt 
extension bill. The current debt ceiling of $5 trillion is expected to be 
reached by late October. Mr. Clinton might veto an extension because 
Republicans plan to attach welfare reform, Medicare savings, and tax cuts to 
the debt ceiling. If the ceiling is not raised on time, then the federal 
government is legally prohibited from continuing to borrow. It can continue to 
spend the money that is collected in taxes, but it cannot borrow to send out 
Social Security checks, veterans benefits, payments to defense contractors, and 
so forth.
<P>
How should the press cover this melodrama? Some tips:
<P>
First, a budget train wreck would be neither disastrous nor unprecedented. 
Ronald Reagan closed down the government for a day on several occasions as a 
result of policy disputes with Congress. Then, the circumstances were reversed: 
Reagan vetoed congressional appropriations bills because they spent too much, 
not too little. Moreover, even if the impasse between Congress and the White 
House lasted for several or even many more days, since essential government 
services would continue, only nonurgent federal spending would be halted. 
Surely few would be hurt if Head Start funding or NEA grants were discontinued 
for a few days.
<P>
Second, White House claims that the GOP budget includes deep, mean-spirited 
cuts should be greeted with skepticism. The GOP budget would allow federal 
spending to climb by $350 billion over the next seven years. The President 
wants to spend an extra $600 billion over this same period. Like the dispute 
over school lunch programs earlier this year, the debate is really about how 
much more should be spent on social programs.
<P>
Third, the charge that the GOP plan includes substantial tax cuts for the rich 
lacks factual support. Of the $250 billion tax cut package that will soon be 
agreed to by the House and Senate, the vast majority of the benefits accrue to 
working class Americans with children. The middle-class child tax credit is 
about four times as expensive as the capital gains tax cut. And this child 
credit is very similar to the middle-class tax cut Bill Clinton promised in 
1992. The official Joint Tax Committee finds that the House GOP tax package 
provides the largest percentage reduction in taxes to Americans with incomes 
between $30,000 and $75,000.
<P>
Fourth, the President may not be altogether hostile to the idea of a short-term 
shutdown of the government. During some past shutdowns of the federal 
government, few Americans even noticed. A several-day closure of non-essential 
federal activities may not be the doomsday scenario outside of Washington that 
it is perceived to be inside the beltway. This train wreck may have no 
casualties.
<P>
Fifth, the underlying policy disagreement between the President and Congress is 
whether there should be a balanced budget by 2002. The core dispute between the 
Congress and the President is not over tax cuts, Medicare savings, or welfare 
reform. The fundamental disagreement is whether the nation should be set on a 
course toward a balanced budget.
<P>
The budgetary showdown will, of course, be big news. But reporters should 
refrain from calling a temporary shutdown of the government a crisis when most 
Americans' lives will be changed very little. If reporters cry wolf too often, 
people may stop listening.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
Small, ugly Ferengi represent sci-fi series' vision of business owners
Many observers have noted the exceptional nature of the Star Trek shows. 
According to TV Guide, for instance: "The Star Trek series and films can, in 
theory, foster deeper understanding and better communication among people. But 
do they?" When it comes to race relations, the value of friendship, and the 
virtue of loyalty, the Star Trek shows do. But when it comes to business, 
economics, and the profit motive, they do not.
<P>
The only regular characters on the Star Trek shows who engage in commerce are 
the Ferengi. They are a small, ugly species. They care only about profit and 
seem to think that the best way to earn a profit is to cheat and trick 
customers, even each other. They are disdained by nearly every other species, 
which, it is made clear, have evolved beyond the profit motive.
<P>
The Ferengi have the highest profile role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 
third incarnation of the Star Trek series. Almost all of the show's non-Ferengi 
regular characters promote virtue and bring honor to their jobs. They lead 
admirable lives. Viewers, last season, saw the stoic Commander Sisko devote his 
life to his son and his crew. They saw Major Kira, a former terrorist, become a 
trusted crew member.
<P>
Odo, a Changeling (one who can change form at will) and the space station's 
head of security, defies his own aggressive species when they threaten his 
friends on the station. Viewers learn that Doctor Bashir chose medicine as a 
profession because it would allow him "to help people." Lieutenant Dax, Sisko's 
confidant, is reliable and wise. And Chief O'Brien puts the happiness of his 
wife, a botanist turned teacher, above his own happiness.
<P>
But then there's Quark, a Ferengi business owner on the space station. Quark 
runs a bar and gambling casino. He puts nothing ahead of profit, except perhaps 
saving his own skin. For instance, on the October 1, 1994 episode, Sisko is 
assigned to establish relations with a relatively unknown species. He wants 
Quark to go along on the dangerous mission because the Ferengi have done 
business with the species. Quark is reluctant and recommends sending his 
brother, Ram, instead. "Ram only has a son to think about. I have a business," 
Quark pleads.
<P>
On the October 15, 1994 episode, a Klingon is accidentally killed in Quark's 
bar. The bar had been doing poorly, but the killing attracts the morbid 
curiosity of onlookers. Quark, to keep their interest, concocts an elaborate 
story about how he killed the Klingon. Business booms, but Ram is worried about 
his brother's ploy. Quark remains steadfast: "Look at that crowd. How long has 
it been since you've seen that many customers waiting to get in here? This is 
an opportunity to turn everything around."
<P>
On the May 20, 1995 episode, Quark visits the Ferengi home planet and viewers 
learn that Ferengi women are not allowed to wear clothes, address men they do 
not know, and, most of all, earn a profit. Quark's mother is accused of all 
three and Quark is held responsible. The clear message: Everything about the 
Ferengi, including the pursuit of profit, is antediluvian. In the same episode, 
one of Quark's relatives decides to join Star Fleet. Quark is livid: "He's a 
disgrace to this family and to Ferengi everywhere. He should be here, helping 
us earn a profit, not in his room learning how to be more like a human."
<P>
On the February 25 episode, the Grand Nagus, who is the leader of the Ferengi 
people, is abducted and brainwashed by aliens. When he returns he seeks to 
reform the Ferengi way of life, to make Ferengi less interested in profit. 
Quark confronts the aliens, who explain their disgust of profit: "We found the 
concept aggressive, adversarial, dangerous. We could not comprehend how any 
species could lead such a barren existence."
<P>
Quark then threatens that if the aliens don't restore the Grand Nagus to his 
former self, more Ferengi would come and bother them. Only then do they agree 
to restore the Nagus. From what viewers see of the Ferengi, who could blame 
them?
<P>
Such depictions of the Ferengi are typical, and there are no positive business 
characters balancing such portrayals. On Star Trek, viewers see people of 
different races, even different species, working together for a common cause 
and putting others ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, business isn't part of 
this vision; rather it's seen as fit only for a small, ugly, less-than-evolved 
subspecies.

<center><h2>Reporters Say American Dream
Stolen</h2>
</center>
<p>
&quot;America: Who Stole the Dream?&quot; was the provocative
title of a recent tenpart Philadelphia Inquirer series, published
nationally in KnightRidder newspapers, by PulitzerPrize winning
journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. Their answer
to the series' title question: freemarket proponents and foreigners.
But in their lengthy series they didn't mention some important
facts that critics have since pointed out.
<P>
Free trade was one of
Barlett and Steele's main villains. Instead of creating jobs in
export industries, low American tariffs have &quot;wiped out jobs
and driven down wages.&quot; Barlett and Steele lamented that
in 1996, &quot;the United States will record its 21st consecutive
merchandise trade deficit  a record unmatched by any other developed
country.&quot; America's other big economic problem, according
to Barlett and Steele, is immigration to the U.S. &quot;No other
industrial country has allowed in so many workers in so short
a time, depressing wages and living standards.&quot;
<P>
While these
policies are good for big business in the short term, the two
reporters suggest that American workers may be on the verge of
starting a revolution. They quoted a Kansas factory worker as
saying: &quot;Are we just going to keep lowering our standard
of living? When that happens, nobody is going to have money to
put food on the table. Then you are going to see a revolution,
because people are not going to be able to feed their families.&quot;
A Pennsylvania factory worker told the duo that &quot;there's
going to be bloodshed before we get out of this.&quot; These workers,
Barlett and Steele informed readers, &quot;reflect a largely silent
but growing sentiment&quot; in the U.S. Profiles of people with
such sentiments dominated the series. The two reporters proposed
restricting immigration and hiking tariffs.
<P>
The reaction to the
series was quick and severe. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson
called it &quot;junk journalism&quot; in a September 18 Washington
Post column. &quot;What [the series] doesn't say is that the trade
balance and employment are hardly connected,&quot; he wrote. Samuelson
pointed out that the trade surpluses of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Sweden  which Barlett and Steele envy  haven't kept those
countries from having far higher unemployment rates than the United
States. According to Samuelson, Barlett and Steele reported such
matters &quot;so select ively...that ordinary readers are misled.&quot;
<P>
The reporters' selective use of anecdotes and statistics bothered
George Washington University's Steve Suranovic. In a September
25 letter to the Inquirer, Suranovic wrote that it is easy for
reporters &quot;to choose individuals whose stories confirm their
conclusions.&quot; He argued that Barlett and Steele could have
&quot;found workers with new jobs in export industries earning
higherthanaverage wages&quot; and &quot;profiled  a couple of
millionaires with middleclass backgrounds who created export industries
employing thousands of workers. Bill Gates springs to mind.&quot;
<P>
The Cato Institute's Stuart Anderson argued that Barlett and Steele
misled readers about the economic effects of immigration. In an
October 14 Investor's Business Daily editorial, Anderson pointed
out that having more people in the U.S. does not lead to more
unemployment. The reason: &quot;While immigrants do increase the
supply of labor, they also increase the demand for labor.&quot;
His proof: As immigration and trade deficits have increased over
the past 20 years, and total employment has increased 59 percent,
&quot;the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.2
percent.&quot; According to Anderson, &quot;Even the total number
of unemployed people in the country has dropped.&quot;
<P>
The views
of Samuelson, Suranovic, and Anderson are held by enough economists
that they should be discussed in any major, tenpart economic series
that purports to be serious journalism.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Global Economy As a News Story,
1991-1992 vs. 1995-1996</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit in Trade Reporting</h2>
</center>
<p>
International trade has almost ceased to be an issue to report on for the network
news media. This is in stark contrast to 1991 and 1992, when the
media reported heavily on trade as an electionyear issue. As a
result, the trade deficit  though large  is not nearly the negative
story (except in KnightRidder papers, see page one) for President
Clinton that it was for President Bush. Media Research Center (MRC)
analysts reviewed all of the stories about foreign trade on ABC's
World News Tonight, CBS <I>Evening News</I> and NBC <I>Nightly News</I> between
July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992. There were 134 trade stories during
this period. MRC analysts also reviewed all of the stories about
foreign trade on the same shows between July 1, 1995 and June
30, 1996. There were only 39 trade stories during this period.
<P>
There was also a large difference in the tone of the stories. During
the 1991-1992 study period, many stories focused on how trade,
especially with Japan, was harming America. Trade was like war.
According to NBC's Garrick Utley, on the January 12, 1992 Nightly
News, there is a &quot;new superpower rivalry. We, of course,
won the old one with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the new
one with Japan is much less certain.&quot; Stories focused on
union demands for tariffs and the views of protectionist economists.
<P>
Reporters adopted a different attitude during the 1995-1996 study period.
Spurred by Pat Buchanan's criticism of free trade, the networks
began pointing out the benefits of a global economy. Before the
South Carolina primary, NBC's Mike Boettcher contrasted the &quot;new
South, flush with foreign investment and hightech jobs&quot; with
&quot;the old South, shuttered textile mills, unemployment, and
pleas for protection from foreign competitors.&quot; ABC's Aaron
Brown reported that &quot;while Buchanan says you can protect
industries with high tariffs without driving out foreign companies
here, economists say that is nonsense.&quot;
<P>
There was also a dramatic change in the amount of coverage given to the trade deficit. In
a 1988 study for the Media Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University's
Ted J. Smith III found that as the American economy improved during
the 1980s, reporting on the economy decreased in volume and became
more negative in tone. In particular, he found that the media
became more interested in one statistic  the trade deficit  when
it widened and less interested in other indicators as they improved.
<P>
The trend in trade reporting that Professor Smith found during the
1980s was present during the 1991-1992 study period, when the U.S.
economy was coming out of recession. There were 21 reports about
the trade deficit, about the same number he found when the economy
was coming out of recession from 1982-1983. But during the 1995-1996
study period, when the economy was fully out of recession and
the trade deficit was expanding, there were only eight such reports.
During the Reagan era, when the economy was fully out of recession,
trade deficit reporting increased dramatically.
<P>
During 1991-1992, even decreases in the trade deficit were treated skeptically.
&quot;Some mixed signs on the U.S. economy today,&quot; reported
ABC's Forest Sawyer, on the March 19, 1992 World News Tonight.
&quot;The U.S. trade deficit grew smaller in January, down $5.8
billion. Still, many economists say they are concerned that American
exports were also down.&quot; 
<P>
Trade deficits, though, have not been big news more recently. In two instances, only CBS mentioned reports of widening trade gaps. On July 18, 1995, Dan Rather announced:
&quot;The United States has taken another beating in world trade,
posting a recordhigh deficit in May.&quot; Nearly two months later,
on September 12, 1995, Rather used almost identical language:
&quot;The U.S. took a beating in the world markets for the second
quarter of the year, posting the biggest quarterly trade deficit
ever.&quot; ABC and NBC ignored the news.
<P>
Trade deficits may not be such bad news. Many economists point out that prosperous countries often run trade deficits because they have a lot of money to spend,
and that imports constitute a great benefit to an economy. So
perhaps ABC and NBC were correct to play down the trade numbers.
Still, this was a new standard not applied to GOP presidents.
<P>
And trade in general could be a bigger news issue in this election
year than it has been. Will Bill Clinton, if reelected, again
defy union backers and work to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement? Reporters, who seem to have lost interest in
trade, aren't asking.

<center><h2>New Business Show Better Than Most</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the battleground of the modern world, where war is waged daily. Fortunes are made
or lost in seconds. These are the men and women of Gardner/Ross.
They're brilliant, ruthless, only as good as their next deal...They
work hard and play harder and agree on just one thing  winning
is everything.&quot;
<p>
From this promo for Traders, a Canadian program
now being shown on cable's Lifetime network, one would think that
it would be another typical TV caricature of business: A world
dominated by rogue greedheads who have no redeeming qualities
and whose work does nothing beneficial for society.
<p>
While this
tendency is present in the show, it doesn't always dominate. Traders
instead treats investment banking the way television usually treats
some other vocations, which is a step above the way business is
normally portrayed. Traders focuses on the Torontobased investment
firm Gardner/Ross. The plots center on the firm's senior executives:
<p>
<blockquote>
Sally Ross -- An idealistic economics professor, Ross steps into her father's
role as senior partner when he is arrested for illegally skimming
$5 million off of a $47 million deal. She is immediately at odds
with the firm's other senior executives, who want to make money
at all costs. She wants to make money, but also wants to preserve
her family firm's good name. When she doesn't allow the firm's
head trader to trade on inside information, he yells: &quot;You
know, you've got a really unhealthy sense of morality.&quot;
<p>
Adam Cunningham -- Ross's alter ego, Cunningham is willing to blackmail
government officials to land a deal. He has no conscience, but
a great knack for cliches: Investment banking is a &quot;zerosum
game. Nobody wins unless somebody loses&quot; and &quot;We all
know the game. You buy on rumor, you sell on fact. Look, if enough
people believe that fertilizer is worth more than gold, the next
thing you know crap is selling at $600 an ounce.&quot; When the
Russian mob threatens the family of the editor of the firm's newsletter,
Cunningham worries that the editor will care more about her family
than the firm.
<p>
Jack Larkin -- A very hungry young trader, he makes
his way to Gardner/Ross by landing a seatofthepants mining deal.
He's willing to risk everything for a big deal, but he's no Cunningham.
He cares deeply about mending his poor relationship with his father,
and his father's illness occupies as much of his time as does
the firm's business. It also gives him some perspective. When
a young trader almost ruins her career by not placing an order
out of concern for a client who is a compulsive gambler, Larkin
tells her: &quot;I'll deny I ever said this, but it's just a job;
it's just money.&quot; By steering the firm into investing in
an emerging medical drug, Larkin shows viewers that investment
banking can help society.
<p>
Marty Stephens -- The firm's head trader,
Stephens is a younger Cunningham. When the firm's building catches
fire, he threatens to fire any trader who leaves the floor. Is
extensive flooding in South Africa bad news? Not for Stephens,
because the firm will make money from the flood's effect on the
markets. His family life is a mess: He doesn't know the name of
his son's girlfriend, even though she eats dinner with the family
every week. When Stephens is suspended for 30 days because of
unethical trades, his life seems to change. He finds a support
group and learns that he is obsessed with money to compensate
for his own insecurities. He resolves to change his ways, but
once he's back on the floor the old Marty returns.
<p>
Suzanna Marks -- Marks runs the firm's investment newsletter. She becomes the
target of the Russian mob, which wants her to recommend a stock
she doesn't want to recommend. She stands on principle, refusing
to compromise her integrity. The Russians then threaten her family,
including her young daughter. Though terribly tempted, she still
doesn't cave. The situation is resolved when Larkin, whom viewers
learn has some mysterious tie to the Russian mob, finds out about
the threats and intervenes. The stress, though, ruins her family
life. Her husband, believing she places too great a priority on
work, files for divorce and custody of their daughter. 
<p>
Traders has often been compared to ER, but it is more like L.A. Law. On
ER, there is no question that the doctors are engaged in noble
work. On L.A. Law, sometimes the lawyers helped people and society;
sometimes they harmed people and society. Some of L.A. Law's lawyers
were extremely unethical, some morally upright. Traders' traders
are a similar mix. For business, as portrayed on television, this
is a step up in the world.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Stephen Gold</title>

<center><h2>Media
Tweak Tax Facts</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many journalists swarmed like hornets after the
first presidential debate, their stingers aimed at a Bob Dole
soundbite statistic. Maybe the numbers seemed implausible to them.
Maybe they deemed Dole's private source for the statistic less
reliable than comparable government sources. Or, just maybe, they
were simply expressing their kneejerk bias against conservative
economic principles.
<p>
Whatever the reason, the day after the first
debate, several media outlets challenged Dole's Tax Foundation inspired
statement  that the average American household today pays more
in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.
<p>
In a frontpage story, for example, the Los Angeles Times hinted at
a Dole blunder. The article related that while Dole relied on
a conservative think tank for his data, &quot;the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer expenditure survey found that the average
household spent more than twice as much on food, clothing and
shelter as on taxes in 1994.&quot; Eric Engberg of CBS News was
more forthright in his analysis. Asserting that &quot;some [of
Dole's] facts got mangled,&quot; Engberg stated the GOP nominee's
claim was an &quot;exaggeration&quot; that could be disproved
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) study.
<p>
Ironically, while these and other news organizations used the opportunity to show
how Dole, in the words of the Times, was &quot;tweaking&quot;
the truth to his advantage, it appears the media were doing the
same thing. By accepting the BLS data as unimpeachable, the reporters
made an error of such magnitude that, if committed by either of
the presidential candidates, it would have made frontpage news
nationwide.
<p>
The problem is the BLS survey greatly understates taxes
paid. While the national survey is considered an accurate portrayal
of consumer expenditures, in the tax category the report only
covers individual income taxes (federal, state, and local), real
and personal property taxes, and an amorphous category called
&quot;other taxes.&quot;
<p>
Among the most recognizable omissions
from the survey: Social Security taxes paid. While the BLS survey
doesn't have a category for such payments, the Tax Foundation
estimates that the average household will pay about $1,100 for
the employee's share of payroll taxes alone this year. Similarly,
the BLS survey doesn't specifically report sales and excise taxes
paid. In the only entry in the survey in which these taxes might
fit (&quot;other taxes&quot;), households earning between $50,000
and $69,000 are said to pay $77 annually. By comparison, based
on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the Tax Foundation
estimates that households in that income group average over $2,000
in federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes paid.
<p>
Also,
the BLS survey results altogether ignore the effect of indirect
levies, such as business taxes, on American society. Unlike the
survey, the Tax Foundation incorporates all taxes at all levels
of government in its annual analysis, including those levies hidden
from taxpayers. For example, business taxes (including corporate
income taxes) must be borne by the general population somehow,
whether through lower wages for workers, lower shareholder dividends
(which harms anyone with a pension fund), or higher consumer prices.
So, while the typical American won't ever see a tax bill for these
taxes, they're certainly paid by everyone.
<p>
In total, the BLS survey
 relied on by so many reporters to knock Bob Dole's argument for
lower taxes  understates total taxes paid by more than four times,
according to the Tax Foundation's analysis based on BEA data.
<p>
The
flaw here isn't the BLS survey. It lies in the way the survey's
results were used by reporters. The search for truth by the media
is undeniably critical, especially during an election year. Unfortunately,
the public is hurt when reporters, to prove a point, choose to
accept certain economic premises without verifying their legitimacy.

<title>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</center></h2>
<p>
With Congress trying to scale back the Clinton Administration's direct lending program for college students, the media have focused on partisan bickering over the issue. This has obscured the larger question: Why are tuitions rising so fast in the first place?
<p>
On the September 10 World News Tonight ABC's Michele Norris said, "The battle over federal funding for education is turning into an all-out political war. Republican lawmakers are proposing deep cuts in education. President Clinton has said that one of his top priorities is not only maintaining but increasing education spending, particularly for needy college students."
<p>
This politics-centered coverage continued with Rita Braver's report on the September 11 CBS Evening News: "President Clinton took his education crusade to Southern Illinois....He told college students that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut their financial assistance." Braver's story, like Norris's, was relatively balanced; Braver noted "Republicans suggest the President is perpetrating a big lie on campus, engaging in scare tactics to make families believe that student aid is in jeopardy." 
<p>
But neither report took the opportunity to discuss why college costs have risen and how growing federal education spending may be the culprit. Heritage Foundation scholar John Hood points this out in the May issue of Reason: "College administrators, waxing sympathetic, beg for more aid from Congress and state legislatures. Interestingly, those same administrators, along with policy makers and the media, rarely try to explain why college costs are rising." 
<p>
Hood points out that average tuitions rose by a third between 1984 and 1994 because "governments, both federal and state, subsidize colleges and universities -- even private ones -- so heavily that tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education."
<p>
Hood shows that the recent rise in federal spending on higher education closely corresponds with the hike in tuition: "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges."
<p>
"Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges. College and University revenue from Pell Grants rose by more than 25 percent from 1985-86 to 1991-92; revenue from state-level need-based grants rose by about 15 percent."
<p>
If prices in private industry ever rose so fast, reporters would be quick to ask why. They should hold educators to the same standard.

<title>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</h2><center>

The October 2 Newsweek hailed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a boon to 
the working poor and called Congressional efforts to cut the program "the war 
on work." But Newsweek didn't tell readers about evidence that the EITC 
actually discourages work by creating a huge marginal tax rate on the poor.
<p>
According to Newsweek's Marc Levinson, the program, which provides a tax credit 
to low-income workers and cash to those who don't pay taxes, "hits the 
bulls-eye, aiding families who earn too much for welfare but too little to have 
a tax-favored mortgage." Levinson quoted EITC beneficiary Janene Moore as 
saying: "My kids are not welfare statistics....They can say that their momma 
gets a check all right, but it's from her job, seven hours a day, 35 hours a 
week." Levinson also argued that the EITC "does nothing to discourage marriage" 
and cited fraud as the only argument against cutting the credit.
<p>
But what if the EITC actually discourages work? According to the September 20 
Investor's Business Daily (IBD), "Most economists agree that today it's doing 
more harm than good." According to IBD: "Once the family reaches that limit 
[$11,600], the credit is phased out. For each dollar over $11,600, the family 
loses 21 cents of its EITC until its income hits $28,000. Economists say this 
acts like a marginal tax rate of 21 percent," which "provides a strong 
disincentive to work."
<p>
IBD also cited American Enterprise Institute economist Marvin Kosters who 
points out that even having an EITC may discourage work. "After all, 
[recipients] get a 40 percent raise without working any harder." Kosters also 
claims that the EITC does indeed exact a marriage penalty, in some cases as 
much as $5,000 per couple. According to Kosters, That "would be about 25 
percent of the combined income of the married couple."
<p>
It's not enough for reporters to cite fraud as an argument against the EITC. 
Economists have serious concerns about the program's disincentives to work, 
concerns which must be addressed in a balanced story.

<title>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour</center></h2>
Something unusual happened on September 28. The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, 
normally well known for balanced and fair coverage, gave a one-sided account of 
an important issue. David Gergen, now returned from his role as White House 
adviser, conducted a softball interview of economist Edward Wolff about wealth 
inequality which ignored many flaws in Wolff's analysis.
<p>
Gergen didn't challenge Wolff, author of a recent study on the subject for the 
20th Century Fund, when he claimed that "income of the average family has been 
basically stagnant for the last fifteen, twenty years, and has actually started 
to decline during the 1990s." Wolff said he saw "nothing that suggests that 
these forces are going to abate." Moreover, he blamed the stock market as 
"another factor which has caused wealth and inequality to rise."
<p>
Gergen could have asked Wolff to respond to critics of his study. Christopher 
Farrell reports in the October 9 Business Week what many economists have long 
maintained: "The consumer price index has been overstating inflation by at 
least a percentage point. If that's the case, then real wage gains are 0.8 
percent a year," rather than the 0.2 percent decline reported by government 
statistics. Farrell also reports that "the skill level of American labor is 
improving, with more workers getting the education and training employers 
require" and that in the past, that has produced more equal income 
distribution.
<p>
The August 22 Investor's Business Daily (IBD), meanwhile, points out a major 
flaw in Wolff's study. "Pensions account for about one-third of the average 
household's assets," the newspaper reports, and are "the way most Americans are 
invested in the stock market." But Wolff's study, according to IBD, excludes 
the value of pension plans. (See page 5.)
<p>
Instead of pushing his guest to answer these criticisms, Gergen asked softball 
questions like, "I take it from the tenor of your remarks, as well as your 
study, that you think this growing inequality as you found it is dangerous 
socially for the country?" Viewers have come to expect more from the 
MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour.

<title>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</h2></center>

Network news coverage of Japan has changed recently. When Japan seemed 
invincible, network journalists would often report on Japanese industrial 
policy with the underlying premise that it made Japanese capitalism superior to 
American capitalism. Now, with Japan's economy in a prolonged tailspin, the 
networks have dropped the subject, no longer showing any interest in the 
economic effects of Japanese industrial policy.
<p>
Ned Potter's December 15, 1992 ode to Japan's government planners for ABC's 
World News Tonight was typical of a pre-1995 network story on Japan. Potter 
told viewers that environmental protection would be the biggest new industry of 
the future. He said that while the U.S. was leading the world in environmental 
cleanup technology, "Japan is mounting a major offensive to be the new leaders 
in what they call the eco-industrial revolution."
<p>
Potter glowingly described "Genesis," the Japanese plan to direct companies to 
work on such projects as technology for clean coal and oil plants. The moral of 
Potter's story: Genesis "shows how far ahead the Japanese are looking. And 
that's the challenge for America. With the new Administration seeking an 
economic revival, how can it best help U.S. industry compete with Japan for the 
environmental marketplace?"
<p>
That was 1992. Reporters, understandably, no longer use Japan as a model of 
government economic planning. But they also aren't talking about Japanese 
industrial policy at all anymore, even though in Japan, the role of government 
is the subject of fierce debate. U.S. News & World Report's Stephen Butler 
relates that "a fast-selling, controversial new book that has unleashed a 
torrent of debate in Tokyo suggests Japan must do more than throw money at its 
problems."
<p>
According to Butler, Japanese author Yukio Noguchi argues that Japan's economic 
woes "are a painful legacy of World War II, when the government intervened 
heavily in the private economy and suppressed market forces to boost industrial 
output." But despite this "torrent of debate" about Noguchi's book, no network 
report from Japan has mentioned Noguchi or his free market arguments.
Network reporters should be more curious about the roots of Japan's four-year 
economic stagnation. If they are, they will find and report on a robust debate 
in Japan about the role of government in a free economy.

<title>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</title>

<center><h2>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</h2></center>
<center><h3>Post: Low Pay Not a Dead End </h3></center>

A nation of hamburger flippers in dead-end jobs.
<p>
That's almost always the dire outcome predicted by journalists when they cover 
America's fast-food industry. Such reporting, intended or not, tends to confirm 
and bolster the calls by politicians and academics for ambitious federal 
job-training programs and other measures that they claim are needed to lift 
unskilled Americans out of the minimum-wage trough.
<p>
Such reporting, sadly, misses one of America's major economics and business 
stories: The fast-food industry as the nation's most effective job-training 
program. 
<p>
One reporter, however, obviously has not missed the story. He's the Washington 
Post's Peter Behr who, in a September 11 page one article, profiles Le-Van 
Hawkins, a 35-year-old African-American Horatio Alger who now owns a $39 
million-a year business and who got his start where? At hamburger-flipping 
McDonald's. Throughout his perceptive report, Behr uses Hawkins' own successes 
to make the valid but almost always ignored point that fast-food jobs can be a 
great career beginning rather than a dead end.
<p> 
Behr explains how Hawkins, a high school dropout who had "a serious cocaine 
habit" and grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project, was 
taught discipline and skills by his fast-food employers. At his first 
McDonald's job, writes Behr, Hawkins "became a walking encyclopedia on 
McDonald's procedures for dealing with burgers, pickles and fries. The lesson 
of getting the details right struck." These lessons were reinforced by 
subsequent jobs at Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast-food outlets.
<p>
Citing an executive with Hawkins' firm, Behr tells his readers that there is "a 
career ladder inside the fast-food world, even if the bottom rungs don't reach 
very high. Workers who start out preparing food can advance to production 
leader, hourly shift manager and assistant manager." Some of the Hawkins' store 
managers, reports Behr, "earn up to $50,000 annually and will have the option 
to buy stock in the company."
<p>
Behr too notes the broader economic implications of the fast-food industry. He 
writes: "Fast-food franchises have long been islands of commerce in the often 
depressed sections of major cities." These typically inner-city franchises, 
says Behr, then "provide business for attorneys, accountants and suppliers in 
the community."
<p>
Behr's report is a needed antidote to journalists' prevailing low-view of 
low-paying jobs. Characteristic of this is Time's John Greenwald in the 
magazine's November 14, 1994 edition. Writing about high-salaried computer 
jobs, Greenwald remarked that they "bear little resemblance to the low-paying 
gas-pumping and fast food-making positions that the word 'services' has often 
brought to mind." This echoed Beth Belton's USA Today article of February 15, 
1994, talking about "low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement." 
TV viewers, meanwhile, would have heard ABC's Bob Jamieson, on the March 15, 
1994 World News Tonight, refer derisively to what he called "the low-paying 
service sector."
<p>
These and other journalists should study closely Behr's article. They then 
should investigate how poorly-educated Americans actually can learn job skills 
and work discipline. Their resulting articles could address the questions: What 
trains more workers -- government programs or fast food employers? Who does a 
better job of training? How long do most fast-food workers actually remain at 
the lowest-paying level? Such articles, at last, would begin educating the 
public that hamburger-flipping seldom is a dead-end job.

<p></center>

A WORD FROM L. BRENT BOZELL III<br>
CHAIRMAN, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER<br>
JUNE 1996<p>

CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said it best: &quot;The old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing any more.&quot; From Walter Cronkite to Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, more and more media personalities are admitting the liberal bias they denied for so long, while ridiculing conservatives who raised that charge. 
<p>
The recent Freedom Forum poll of Washington reporters and editors found 89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, to only seven percent for Bush; 61 percent identified themselves as liberal or moderate-to-liberal, to only nine percent who were conservative or moderate-to conservative; 59 percent called the Contract with America &quot;an election-year campaign ploy,&quot; to only three percent who thought it was
&quot;a serious policy proposal.&quot; 
<p>
And their coverage of public policy and politics reflected these views. We are not here today to prove a blatantly obvious anti-conservative bias in the press. We have proven that for almost a decade. We are here to demand an end to the non-stop media onslaught against the conservative movement -- against our ideas, our character, and our leaders. We are here to demand the media be fair and balanced -- for once. 
<p>
To this end, I announce &quot;Media Reality Check '96,&quot; a 2.8 million dollar campaign by the Media Research Center to expose for the American electorate the
blatant left-wing agenda that has made a mockery of the term &quot;objective journalism.&quot; The message from the conservative movement, like the line from the movie &quot;Network,&quot; is loud and clear: &quot;We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will combine the most sophisticated media research operation with the most advanced technology to produce what we believe the most comprehensive and creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal bias that dominates the news media today. 
<p>
Knowing how so many establishment media outlets feel it is their right to examine everything and everyone under the sun, while refusing to allow any criticism of themselves, this year we are bypassing the establishment media and going straight to the voters through the fledgling conservative media. And based on the test-marketing of this campaign over the past month, I can confidently state that our message will reach,
on average, at least 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. As well, all of our findings will be made available to thousands of journalists on a regular basis to let them know their days of journalistic political activism are over.
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will have nine major components: <br>
<ol>
<li>Research. The basis of all our products is research by our eight-member media analysis team, who are taping and analyzing every single network newscast, national
newspaper and news magazine to document trends of liberal bias. Our comprehensive network news tracking system will not only document bias in 1996, but show, with scientific data, just how this follows the pro-Clinton, anti-conservative coverage in 1992.

<li>Publications. All of the MRC's monthly and bi-weekly publications -- MediaWatch, MediaNomics, Notable Quotables, and Flash -- will focus almost exclusively on the issues and trends of campaign '96 for thousands of reporters, subscribers, and activists.

<li>Pattern of Deception. MRC Senior Analyst Tim Graham's new book documents the astonishing bias Bill Clinton has benefited from in the last four years and sets the stage for a national discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. In less than six weeks, he has conducted interviews or had his blockbuster book cited on over 50 radio shows, from local shows to nationally syndicated programs like the G. Gordon
Liddy show, the Ollie North show, and Rush Limbaugh. 

<li>Talk Radio. Over the past several months we have established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows -- including every major nationally-syndicated show -- to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias in the establishment press masquerading as &quot;objective news.&quot; As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on numerous shows coast to coast to expose the liberal media.

<li>The Internet. Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with hundreds of thousands of conservative activists while providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The MRC website will be up and running on June 24 for public
and media use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and special reports. MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing &quot;Reality Check Cyber Alerts&quot; through e-mail to the nation's most influential opinion leaders three to five
nights a week for a rapid response to media bias.

<li>Media Outreach. Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1500 media and political contacts across the country on a regular basis. In addition, bias during major campaign events -- such as the upcoming conventions -- will be addressed with news releases and news conferences throughout the year.

<li>Conventions. Once again this year, the MRC will publish a daily newsletter during the two party conventions to document the ongoing political slant in prime-time convention
coverage. This year, the MRC is also considering a daily national radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily commentary will reach tens of millions of voters.

<li>Conservative Grass-Roots Activism. To make the so-called objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing thousands of bumper stickers,
pens, refrigerator magnets and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media.&quot; The national distribution efforts are already under way. MRC members -- 75,000 nationwide -- will also participate through letter-writing  campaigns and other efforts to expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.

<li>Paid Advertising. The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio talk shows will be the vehicle of choice for our paid advertising efforts; again, based on the test-marketing of this communications strategy, we are confident it will have a huge impact.
</ol>
Will the national media try again to tilt the election in favor of Bill Clinton? Will they try again consistently to label the Republicans as &quot;extremists&quot; -- or worse -- and the Democrats as moderates, even conservatives?<br>
Will they regularly denounce Republican ads as &quot;wrong&quot; when they were proven right, while ignoring Clinton ads altogether?<br>
Will they try again to single out the Republicans as mudslinging campaigners while presenting the Democrats as a hopeful force for positive change? If so, the MRC will be there to show America just how distorted the message really is. 
<p>
By no means do we suggest that all reporters in the national press are culpable. Many have distinguished themselves, and continue to distinguish themselves with their dedication to balance and fairness. And that's all we conservative ask. But this year we demand it.

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

<h2><center>Quote of the Day</h2><p>
  
    <i>"I think there were some transcendent moments but some risky
rhetorical gambles here, where Bob Dole may have taken the
risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than
the grown-up he most wants to be, and that could turn off
some voters." <p>

-- ABC s Michel McQueen just after Dole's
acceptance speech last night.<p></i>
  
<h2><a name="speech">Dole's Speech</a> Performance Praised by Most, But... 
ABC: Dole s "A Preachy Grandfather"</h2></center>
  
    Bob Dole speech coverage featured praise for his delivery,
but the networks were critical of its content. <p>
  
    -- ABC condemned it as "preachy," and NBC called it "tough."
Just after Dole finished, ABC's Michel McQueen warned that he
may have come across as a "preachy grandfather" [see Quote of
the Day below]. Sam Donaldson called it "a red meat speech"
and a "a very tough speech, I mean, Bob Dole says that
violent criminals will have their lives made a living Hell,
he'd pursue terrorists to the ends of the Earth, I think he s
going to dash the teachers  unions into the sea." NBC's Lisa
Myers described it as "the best speech I ever saw Bob Dole
give," but colleague David Bloom said "this was a very tough
speech, Bob Dole calling himself combative for country, but
the people down here, the partisans loved it."<p>
  
    -- CNN went to Wolf Blitzer for a Democratic response just
four minutes after Dole finished. Gene Randall then demanded
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed respond to that spin: "Let
me just run by first what George Stephanopoulos said about
the speech. Even before it was over he called it, 'The most
negative, partisan, divisive acceptance speech since
Goldwater in 1964.'"<p>
  
    -- In Dole's speech CNN's Bernard Shaw discovered the
beginning of a nasty campaign: "I ve maintained that this
campaign is going to be one of the nastiest, bare-knuckled,
direct to the gut campaign's in America s political history.
Listen to this one sentence, quote 'It is demeaning to the
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the
elite never grew up, never did anything real, never
sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the
power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving
schemes.'"<p>  
    -- One day after Ted Koppel left San Diego, Nightline covers
the convention, talking with a focus group; reporters discuss
GOP inclusiveness.<p>
  
    -- A Video Contrast: In 1992 ABC and CBS ran bios of Clinton;
but nothing for Dole this year. NBC ran part of Clinton's
video, but none of Dole's. <p>
  

<h2><center><a name="diversity">So Much for Network Bio Diversity
The Man from Hope vs. Russell's Own</a></h2></center><p>

    Four years ago at the Democratic convention in New York, ABC's 
Peter Jennings explained the quandary biographical films present
to the networks. "I'm not precisely sure what to call it," 
Jennings said, "but it's the Democratic Party's film 
about Bill Clinton's life, and it's something we try to 
come to grips with every four years when the party decides what
its view of the candidates is." ABC's 1992 resolution: "We 
think it's usually more prudent to give the assignment to a
reporter." Reporter Jeff Greenfield then introduced viewers to
Bill Clinton's life story.<p>

    CBS did the same. Dan Rather told viewers: "The delegates are 
now watching a film about Bill Clinton, prepared by the Clinton
campaign. We asked correspondent Richard Threlkeld to look at the
film and report on it." NBC aired the final three minutes of the
"Man from Hope" film. This year, CBS only showed the last 30
seconds of the Republicans biographical film for Dole and didn't
assign the story to a reporter. NBC aired nothing. ABC skipped
the film so it could check in with Brit Hume with President
Clinton in Wyoming, with the vital news that Clinton claimed he
wasn't watching the convention.<p>

    Bob Dole's life story would still be news to many Americans. 
<i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> Gloria Borger noted in the 
June 3 issue that "A Harris poll last month found that 59 percent
of Americans don't know Dole has a disibility." They must watch
too much television news.<p>


<h2><center><a name="CBS">Paula Zahn Insists CBS Coverage Has "Been Abundantly Fair"
But CBS Impugned GOP as "Extremist"</a></h2></center><p>
  
    Wednesday night Marc Morano, best known as the Rush Limbaugh
TV show's "man in Washington," confronted several network
reporters with his camera and microphone. Asked about liberal
bias, CBS correspondent Paula Zahn responded:<p>
  
    "Those of us who work for organizations like CBS News take
great pride in being fair and I think if you look at this
Republican convention, our coverage, you ll agree that we
have been abundantly fair." Well, Morano asked, what about
the use of extremist labels? "I don t think I ve used the
word extremist once since I got here on Saturday," the former
CBS This Morning co-host insisted. "Obviously, labels, I
think are very limiting and we have to be very careful about
how we use that."<p>
  
    She may be able to restrain herself, but her colleagues are
not so professional. On Monday's CBS Evening News Dan
Rather asked Jack Kemp: "Even some Republicans describe the
current platform as quote, 'harsh, extreme,' even 'radical.' 
Do you see it that way?"  <p>
  
    Lesley Stahl, later that night in prime time, claimed: "The
whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is
to diminish the image of this party as extreme, because
that's what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main
speaker at the convention...was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling,
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell,
he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that
extreme. It's turning them off." <p>
  
    But Zahn is far from innocent. Take a look at a question that
she posed on the July 5, 1995 CBS This Morning to Pat
Buchanan: "Even your sister concedes, although some
supporters might like what you have to say about the economy
and these very specific issues you just mentioned, they re
very turned off by some of your social policies. And you know
you ve got political enemies out there calling you an
isolationist, a bigot, you re anti-gay, and some even go as
far as saying that your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi
Germany. How are you to win them over?"<p>


<center><h2><a name="week">What TV Showed: Extremist, Intolerant & Strident Republicans
The Distorted Week in Review<a/></center><p></h2>
  
    So what have viewers across America heard about the
Republican convention? At week s end, here s a collection of
the most biased quotes from the networks:<p>
  
    -- "He [Kemp] is a rare combination 'a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters.'" <p>
<i>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August
9 Inside Politics.</i><p>
  
    -- "Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will
judge his time in office -- the deficits, the Iran-Contra
affair. But for the members of this party, there is no more
beloved figure." <p>

<i>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's
emotional thank-you following a video tribute to Ronald
Reagan, August 12 NBC convention coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party
being a very inclusive party, one that can embrace the views
of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out
vis-a-vis abortion, and the fact that some of these
Republican governors are not speaking because they felt as if
they were being censored. Do you still believe you can call
the Republican Party an inclusive party?" <p>
<i>-- One of seven
abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 Today.</i><p>
  
   -- "Women have not responded well to a message that at times
has been considered too harsh, too mean." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Michel
McQueen, during August 13 coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily
designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity
that's starkly at odds with reality." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Jim Wooten on
Colin Powell s address, August 13 World News Tonight.</i><p>
  
    -- "The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming
issue for women at election time. But this fight within the
Republican Party has many women questioning how far this
party will go to limit their rights."  <p>
<i>-- ABC s Peter Jennings,
August 13.</i><p>
  
    -- "Although his speech was generally well-received, the
reception was restrained, and there were boos whenever Powell
steered away from the right. Though they booed and also
heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion
throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." -- <p>
<i>Today
co-host Bryant Gumbel.</i><p>
  
    -- "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men
and this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you
think before tonight they thought very much what happens in
America with rape?" <p>
<i>-- Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence
who had just addressed the convention, August 13.  </i><p>
  
    -- "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean." <p>
<i>-- NBC's Tim Russert
previewing Hutchison's August 13 speech.</i><p>
  
    -- "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want
much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on
President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating
habits." <p>
<i>-- ABC Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson,
August 14. </i><p>
  
    -- "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so
loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it,
or quite the contrary?" <p>
<i>-- Gumbel to Tim Russert, August 14
Today.</i><p>
  
    -- "Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a
Russian television reporter said today that this is as
tightly controlled as anything the Communist Party ever put
on, Tom." <p>
<i>-- NBC reporter David Bloom, August 14 Nightly News.</i><p>

<h3>Bryant the Killjoy</h3><p>
  
    As the rest of the media conceded the success of Elizabeth
Dole's Wednesday night speech from the floor, Today co-host
Bryant Gumbel grumbled Thursday morning: "Yeah, I guess some
would say it was cool. Others would say it was calculating,
huh?" <p>
  
    Later, Gumbel added: "In keeping with the softer image that
Republicans are trying hard to project at their convention,
Elizabeth Dole last night did her impression of Oprah
Winfrey, and in a fashion that supporters would call
heartfelt but others would call hokey, Liddy Dole sang her
husband s praises to the delegates." <p>
  
  
<h3>Ending With a Bang</h3><p>
  
    ABC's Brian Ross filed stories all week long on the corporate
money lavished on the GOP, but his Thursday World News
Tonight report focused on a surprising target: "Very much in
the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations, like
CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than
$100,000 to be an official sponsor of the convention."<p>
  
    Former <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Dwight Morris told Ross
media companies shouldn t use the conventions to lobby, and
Ross noted: "But that didn t stop CBS lobbyists from giving
the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for the cost
of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican
Party Chairman Haley Barbour." <p>
  
    Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC
hospitality suite was a lobbyist s dream. With visits from
Congressman Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which handles telecommunications issues. And then
from the #2  man in the House, Majority Leader Dick Armey,
who could be seen with top ABC executives, including the ABC
lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't lobbying." We look forward
to an equally revealing set of nightly reports from Chicago.<p>
  
  
<h3>William's Wimps</h3><p>
  
    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Bob Davis wrote an article for
the Thursday morning edition on MRC Chairman Brent Bozell and
the Media Reality Check '96 effort in San Diego. Davis found
notable hostility at CNN to Bozell: "His criticism is mostly
background noise,  says CNN political director Tom Hannon."
Davis asked CNN analyst Bill Schneider to explain his claim
last weekend that "conservatives are supposed to be haters"
and Jack Kemp "is a rare combination: a nice conservative."
Said Schneider: "I wasn t name-calling. I was making an
analytical point." He added that he calls liberals wimps, but
"they re so wimpy, they don t complain. When you talk about
mean conservatives, the wrath of God comes down on you."<p>
  
    But a look into the Nexis news data retrieval system finds
something different. Schneider quoted criticism of Colin
Powell s "wimpout" on abortion in 1995. The only other uses
of "wimp" in the last five years were three nearly identical
references in 1992 and 1994 to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis
campaign. Schneider declared on November 1, 1994: "Michael
Dukakis got beaten up by the wimp, which proved he wasn't
tough enough for the job."<p>

<h2>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2>
<p>
<h3>Nightline's True Story</h3>
<p>
ABC News has never been eager to report the truth on GOP efforts to reform Medicare. Good Morning America anchor Morton Dean continually got the story wrong. On October 12 Dean relayed the Democratic line: "The Republican plan would cut $270 billion in Medicare spending over seven years." Exactly two months and scores of inaccurate reports later, ABC finally told the truth with a December 12 Nightline dedicated to exposing President Clinton's demagoguery.
<p>
Chris Bury explained the game, "`Devastate, destroy, dismantle` -- strong words, but in reviewing Mr. Clinton's performance on Medicare, Republicans have another word in mind: deceptive...The truth is, both President Clinton and the Congress want to spend more money, not less, on Medicare."
<p>
Reviewing Hillary Clinton's 1993 appearance before Congress, Bury showed the First Lady's testimony where she proclaimed that her health plan reduced "the rate of growth in Medicare from about 11 percent increase annually to about a 6 or 7 percent increase annually." Then Bury added, "But this year, when Republicans proposed to slow the annual growth of Medicare spending to 7.2 percent...President Clinton accused them of gutting the program."
<p>
Bury concluded his report: "Since August, when President Clinton cast himself in the role of Medicare's protector, his own standing in the polls has risen steadily, and though his performance has been a smashing popular success, many critics believe the price of admission has cost the country an honest debate."
<p>


<h3>A Woman on Welfare</h3>
<p>
When Republicans began to tinker with the welfare system, reporters were quick to point out the millions who would end up in poverty as a result. But on the November 19 60 Minutes, CBS' Lesley Stahl offered a different take when she profiled "a woman who knows as much about the subject as anyone. A woman on welfare? No, a woman on the subject of welfare."
<p>
She was Eloise Anderson, head of California's welfare division. Anderson knows what welfare is like; she was once on it. She  also supports Republican proposals. Stahl noted: "What Anderson wants to get rid of are the cash payments that go directly to welfare recipients, known as AFDC....It seems there's no argument for AFDC that she agrees with. The problem, she says, starts with the way welfare marginalizes men, because no poor man who makes the minimum wage, can compete with it."
<p>
Stahl pointed out: "Her critics have called her everything from mean-spirited to compassionless, but Anderson says it's a question of fairness to low-income workers who pay taxes."  As for fears of disaster, "Anderson says there will be no excuse for not taking a minimum wage job when the cash payments end, because poor people will still get help; with food stamps, medical coverage, and child care."

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>CNN Describes Speaker as "Too Extreme" and "Scary," A "Clown Prince" with "Fits of Pique"<br>
Newt Gingrich, Political Liability?</h3>
<p>
Time selects its Man of the Year not by picking its favorite person, but the person with the most historical impact in that given year. In 1995, certainly, Newt Gingrich had a powerful impact on America's political debate. But that didn't mean Time had to like him -- and neither did CNN in producing a December 17 CNN Presents to announce the pick. For maligning the Speaker as a politically damaged and morally questionable figure after celebrating Time's choice of Bill Clinton in 1992, CNN earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<p>
CNN split its show between interviews with Gingrich and documentary segments. In the first segment, host Judy Woodruff used loaded language to describe Gingrich's "Path to Power," calling his ambition to be Speaker "An obsession that shaped almost every decision, every alliance, what some saw as every betrayal on his path to power." Woodruff relayed a rumor about Gingrich's first wife, Jackie: "It has become part of the Gingrich legend that he would later go to her hospital room where she was being treated for cancer to discuss a divorce." 
<p>
Woodruff described how Gingrich first came to the capital's attention: "In late-night tirades on C-SPAN, he needled then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, painting ruling Democrats as corrupt thugs." Woodruff called him "a clown prince of an out-of-favor group." She concluded: "His self-ordained mission to save Western civilization is becoming overshadowed by a barrage of accusations that the most powerful Speaker in history illegally used political money." While CNN followed with Rep. David Bonior charging Gingrich's ethics are "in the toilet," Woodruff did not explain any of the charges, most of which were dismissed by the House ethics committee days later.
<p>
Another segment, titled "Homefront," explored Gingrich's hold on his constituency in Georgia: "Cobb County -- the soul of Newt country, Republican, white, well-educated, and affluent. The man who would wield the federal budget ax represents a county that exploded into suburban sprawl because of billions of federal dollars. Unemployment is low here, at 3.4 percent. It's well below the national average. And only a scant five percent of Cobb's population is on public assistance. The social fallout of the Contract with America if it passes will have little consequence here, but those hit will be hit hard."
<p>
CNN talked mostly to social service providers, liberal activists, and projected victims: "For the Hogan family, some cutbacks are the wrong thing to do. Daughter Kimberly, disabled from birth, has spent most of her life in a hospital. Thanks to Medicaid, this year has been different." Protesters held up signs reading "Newt: Your Plan Will Kill Us."
<p>

These documentary segments were heavily salted with Gingrich opponents: "The Path to Power" featured five negative talking heads (including three from Rep. Pat Schroeder and one of Bonior) to only three positive. "Homefront" featured twelve anti-Gingrich soundbites to four defenders. A segment called "Report Card" focusing on his future balanced the talking heads six to six, which included Bonior predicting that Gingrich's ethics problems were "so severe" he wouldn't be in office much longer.
<p>
If that hostility weren't enough, there were Woodruff's interview questions to the Speaker: "There's something we saw that was kind of interesting, the latest CNN-Time poll, they asked people what they thought about you and a lot of people said, most people said, very intelligent. A number of them said he has a vision for the future, but they also said -- a large number of those same people said, and I thought this was interesting, they agreed you were too extreme, 66 percent -- and out of touch, 52 percent, and even scary 49 percent. Where does that come from?"
<p>
When Gingrich suggested that things like being portrayed as Scrooge on the cover of Time didn't help, Woodruff replied: "But there's also been, in addition to that, what many people look at as the effect of the Republican budget cuts, and most of the people -- what they see is that most people, according to the studies we've seen, who would lose under the combined budget cuts and tax changes are the very poorest Americans, and people have a hard time understanding that."
<p>
Gingrich challenged that spin, but Woodruff reacted: "The study I'm referring to came out I think in the last week or so, by the Urban Institute, highly respected group, supposed to be nonpartisan -- and they set aside Medicaid and Medicare, they just looked at the budget cuts separate from Medicare and Medicaid and tax changes, and their conclusion was that the families that would lose under the Republican plan, two-thirds are in the poorest fifth of the population." The Urban Institute has often disseminated research that concludes with the need for more federal social spending.
<p>
Woodruff concluded the program with a decidedly negative spin: "He couldn't have envisioned the blizzard of ethics charges or the stir his fits of pique would cause. Now that they've gotten to know him, more than half of all Americans say they don't like him. More than half say they don't trust him. The irony is that Time's Man of the Year may wind up the biggest liability to the revolution he launched."
<p>
This program was a 180-degree change from the show CNN aired on December 26, 1992, when Bill Clinton was named Time's Man of the Year. The 30-minute show featured at least 18 positive talking heads, including Clintonites Robert Reich, Ron Brown, Dee Dee Myers, and Betsey Wright, Democratic Reps. Tom Foley and Lee Hamilton, Democratic consultant Bob Squier, and black academic Henry Louis Gates. Only one soundbite from conservative Arkansas editorialist Paul Greenberg offered any balance. 
<p>
The narration by CNN's Lou Waters and Natalie Allen said nothing about Clinton's troubled private life, nothing about ethics, nothing about overweening ambition. Allen began the show with a quotation: "He was not born a king, but a child of the common people who made himself a great persuader, therefore, a leader by dint of firm resolve, patient effort, and dogged perseverance." Chimed in Waters: "The words were written by Horace Greeley a century ago to describe Abraham Lincoln. They apply as well to this persevering young man from Arkansas, now leader of the Free World." Allen continued: "The election of 1992 was a leap of faith in a sour and unpredictable year. American voters were angry and disgusted and often afraid of the future. They took an enormous risk and made a fascinating choice." 
<p>
CNN prepared a response to MediaWatch questions, but it did not arrive by press time. It will appear next month. CNN may have contributed to the effect its polls have noticed: viewers were instructed that the Speaker was politically extreme, even scary, while Clinton was Honest Abe.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>The Silent Veto.</h3>
Bill Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill late on January 9, in an apparent attempt to avoid that night's news coverage. His concern was understandable; the veto would be an admission that he was breaking his famous campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>
Clinton worried needlessly: None of the network's January 10 evening news shows mentioned Clinton's veto, even after possible GOP opponent Bob Dole took to the Senate floor to criticize Clinton's betrayal. Although the media properly focused on criticism when George Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge, there was no focus on criticism of Clinton. The media missed another opportunity when Clinton held a press conference January 11. He was peppered with 18 questions, but not one raised the issue of his breaking his welfare promise, the crux of his effort to portray himself as a "New Democrat." 
<p>

<h3>Flattening Forbes. </h3>
At first glance, Steve Forbes' presidential campaign would seem to fulfill the media's standards for a proper Republican candidate: One with sufficiently soft stands on social issues to avoid the "divisive" label. Unable to attack Forbes as extremist (he has suitably "tolerant" stands on such issues as abortion and immigration), in the December 4 Time, Senior Writer Richard Stengel charged that "for all his patrician good humor, Forbes' message and his campaign have begun to show a hard edge." Stengel exploited a tenuous link between Forbes and Senator Jesse Helms' racially-tinged campaigns: "While Forbes generally shuns the politics of exclusion, he has nonetheless attracted to his organization two veterans of Jesse Helms' race-baiting campaigns." 
<p>
He also attacked Forbes' centerpiece flat tax proposal: "Despite his frequent protestations that he understands the needs of the average Joe, his flat-tax proposal would reward wealthy investors while leaving the burden on middle-class families." He added the plan would "do little to disabuse taxpayers of the notion that the rich get a better deal from the tax system." He cited data from the "generally liberal" Citizens for Tax Justice, stating a seventeen percent flat tax would produce a revenue shortfall of $200 billion. The group also claimed Dick Armey's similar flat tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families, estimating increases in the $1,740-$4,600 range on families earning between $45,000 and $85,000. 
<p>
Stengel didn't quote a conservative expert, but for a balancing view he could have referred to Time's very own flat tax analysis of April 17, when a CPA estimated how much tax a hypothetical family of four making $50,000 could expect to pay under the Armey plan. Time found the family's taxes would be cut by almost half, from $4,249 under the existing system to $2,244 under the Armey plan.
<p>

<h3>DeParle's Platform.</h3>
Twice in December, The New York Times provided a platform for reporter Jason DeParle's personal crusade against Republican welfare reforms. In the December 17 New York Times Magazine he depicted a post-welfare reform nightmare. DeParle wrote his story as an encyclopedia entry from the year 2015 that took a look back at the history of welfare. 
<p>
The fictitious excerpt presented welfare reform as an initial success when left to the states until a recession hit in 1999: "Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments....With families crossing borders in search of aid, the `race to the bottom' ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors." DeParle described an almost apocalyptic state where mothers were "arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked." DeParle predicted a million families would be "lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners." DeParle continued his gloomy forecast: "Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones."
<p>

DeParle's Other Platform. Two weeks earlier in a Times "Week in Review" piece, DeParle charged: "While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little." 
<p>
DeParle criticized the GOP plan to let states run welfare, taking on supposed GOP arguments such as "The programs don't help much anyway," and "Earnings will improve with time." DeParle even refuted the notion that the poor actually "will be better off by working," answering: "Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women of AFDC will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars."
<p>

<h3>Newt the Destroyer? </h3>
ABC previewed the Democratic strategy to hang Republican Tom Campbell with the "Newtoid" tag, but when the strategy backfired ABC ignored the results. In Carol Lin's December 10 piece for World News Sunday she highlighted Democrat Jerry Estruth's effort to defeat Republican Campbell in a special congessional election to replace retiring Democrat Norman Mineta. Anchor Carole Simpson introduced the story: "For all of Mr. Gingrich's power on Capitol Hill, opinion polls show his star is fading with American voters. So much so that one congressional candidate in California is using the Gingrich image to beat down his once-popular Republican opponent." 
<p>
Lin reported Campbell at one point had enjoyed a 43-point lead over Estruth. "Yet this political novice has managed to cut his popular Republican opponent's lead in half. By redefining the enemy. Estruth launched an ad campaign attacking House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And labeling Tom Campbell as a Gingrich clone." Lin pointed out that Campbell was more moderate than the Speaker on many issues, "But the strategy seems to be working. With more than a million dollars in donations pouring in." Lin continued, "Democrats hope Gingrich's negatives will be the central issue that can turn election campaigns across the country," before concluding: "Campbell is still the front runner in this race but only by a narrow margin. Democrats say that alone is still a victory for their party. Because they found their weapon. The man who started the Republican revolution may give frustrated voters reason enough to bring more Democrats back to office."
<p>
So, did ABC make it a big story when Campbell trounced Estruth by 23 points on December 12? No, not a word about the result on World News Tonight.  
<p>

<h3>Hot Media Air.</h3>
CBS and ABC have recently portrayed House Republicans as the catalysts to impending global doom, but have ignored scientific studies which back the GOP. "Some House Republicans are objecting to the global agreement to ban industrial chemicals widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer," Dan Rather intoned on the November 23 CBS Evening News. Eric Engberg explained "that 150 countries have signed a treaty banning production of ozone depleting chemicals," but "to the number three Republican in the House, it's Chicken Little Stuff...Time out! Not proven? Didn't this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry go to Dr. Mario Molina and two others who discovered ozone depletion?" 
<p>
Over a month later, ABC's January 4 World News Tonight ran another alarmist warning. Peter Jennings began: "Two thousand scientists from all over the world agree the earth is getting warmer all the time, in part because the United States is not practicing what it has been preaching." Ned Potter followed, "scientists say if they [temperatures] keep going up as they have heat waves will spread across North America. A third of the world's glaciers will melt, flooding coastlines in dozens of countries. Tropical diseases will spread, exposing large parts of the U.S. to malaria." Potter charged that the Clinton administration "gave in to the petroleum and auto industries" and then he allowed Vice President Al Gore to blame the House GOP. 
<p>
But the need for action isn't so clear. Washington Post science writer Boyce Rensberger reported January 8 that of the three major studies of global temperatures during 1995 one reported an increase in average temperature, one called 1995 "ordinary," and one found some cooling. Guess which two the networks have ignored?
<p>

Moyers On Wages. PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers returned to Milwaukee for the December 19 Frontline to visit two families who suffered layoffs in 1991 at the motor company Briggs and Stratton. Moyers complained: "Good-paying jobs are heading south or out of the country and workers like Tony Neumann are searching desperately for new jobs that will support their families...In the early '90s, families like the Stanleys and Neumanns were thrown into a emerging new economy built on light manufacturing and service jobs. It was a time when unemployment hit record lows. But many of the new jobs offered only part-time work and no benefits, and they paid lower wages." Moyers concluded the show: "For working people all over America, real wages continue to decline."
<p>
But in a review on the morning before the show, a sequel to the 1992 program Minimum Wages, Washington Post reporter Steven Pearlstein told a story Moyers didn't: "In fact, today there are 12,000 more manufacturing jobs in the Milwaukee area than there were in the fall of 1991 when Claude Stanley and Tony Neumann were laid off, while the average hourly wage in manufacturing has climbed from $12.54 an hour to $13.98, just about keeping pace with inflation." Pearlstein added that Briggs and Stratton motors are now cheaper for consumers and the company is making money for its stockholders.
<p>

Rather Embarrassed. While on Denver's KOA talk radio host Mike Rosen's program, Dan Rather tried to defend himself and his network against charges of bias. Rosen questioned Rather's repeated use of the word "cut" when describing the Republican Medicare plan on the CBS Evening News. Rather shot back, "Some of the time we use the language, `Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time we use that these are, `cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time."
<p>
A review of Evening News broadcasts from September 20, the night before the Republicans unveiled their Medicare plan, to November 28, when Rather appeared on Rosen's program, shows the CBS anchor should pay closer attention to what comes out of his mouth. During this period, Rather used the Democratic spin term `cuts' eight times such as when Rather announced as fact on September 20: "Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut, the question is how much and for how many." On October 25 he claimed that "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and extreme."
<p>

He applied the phrase that best described reality, "reducing the rate of growth," or "reducing spending" three times. He relayed the Republican spin, "making the plan solvent" just once; hardly the "one way one time, one way the next time" which Rather claimed.

<h3>Networks Search for Victims in the Wake of Second Budget Stalemate<br>
The Shutdown Soap Opera</h3>
<p>
December brought a second shutdown of the federal government, and with it came the networks' ratings-grabbing specialty: hanky-waving sob stories of shutdown "victims."
<p>
On December 22, a week into the shutdown and before paychecks were delayed, Jack Smith mourned on World News Tonight: "The shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed. They can't afford a Christmas tree."
<p>
NBC's John Palmer warned on the December 29 Today: "The shutdown is affecting more people's lives every day in places like Grand Teton National Park, where furloughed park employees worried about mortgages, car payments, and  credit card bills have begun filing unemployment benefits. In California and in dozens of other states, serious cutbacks in food programs are threatened unless the budget crisis is resolved soon." Later, David Bloom added: "The shutdown continues. The pain spreads. The pressure grows for Washington to end America's worst budget crisis."
<p>
On January 2, CBS Evening News reporter Scott Pelley compared budget negotiators to bombers: "In April, terrorists tried to kill them. Today, politicians stopped their paychecks. In Oklahoma City's Social Security office, they're being ordered to work for nothing....The bomb broke Beverly Rankin's ankle. Politics is breaking her bank." 
<p>
That night NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw mourned: "Far from the marbled halls of Congress and the elegant furnishings of the White House, this government shutdown is about a lot more than politics. It's about people and their real needs."
<p>
NBC's George Lewis found an Indian health clinic in San Diego: "Two-thirds of the clinic's budget, $95,000 a month, comes from the federal government. Without that money, the clinic can't meet its payroll. The people who run this clinic fear that if it has to close its doors, many of the 4,000 patients who seek treatment here will not look elsewhere. Ron Morton says traditionally, Native Americans do not like to accept handouts." But didn't NBC just say the clinic is two-thirds funded by the federal government? Morton later asserted that "if this budget is not signed there are people who are going to die."
<p>
Bryant Gumbel preached at the start of the January 4 Today: "Although some politicians have foolishly suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway, we will show you how some average Americans are suffering each and every day as a result of what is now 20 days of the government shutdown."

<h3>Today Gushes Over Hillary<br>
"Really Terrific" Book</h3>
<p>
As questions swirled around Hillary Clinton's veracity on Whitewater and the travel office, NBC News gave her a gift: a January 16 Today interview by Maria Shriver, who campaigns for and donates to her uncle Ted Kennedy's Senate campaigns. Shriver served more as political flack than journalistic inquisitor. Shriver opened the show by calling Clinton's new book, It Takes a Village, "really terrific."
<p>
Her first question: "What's this last week and a half been like for you personally?" She followed up about daughter Chelsea: "What has she said to you about these attacks?...This is beyond the territory....This is your mom that someone's talking about." After wondering if she'd be willing to testify before the Senate and posing one question about the travel office, Shriver showed sympathy for Clinton's plight: "Whitewater, I know you've been answering questions on this subject for four years, thousands of pieces of documents have been handed over, but they still want even more. As you look back on this, do you wish you'd never worked for Madison Guaranty?"
<p>
Shriver did ask: "Regarding these billing records that came about that had been subpoenaed two years ago, people say, `Gosh, how could a woman as smart and politically savvy as Hillary Clinton not know where these records were these past two years? Why didn't she make that her priority to find them, particularly when they were found in her own home, under an assistant's desk?'"
<p>
Shriver returned to softballs: "You also quote a letter in there that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?"
<p>
Shriver then stumped for liberalism: "You think government should do a lot more than it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government. How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government needs to be more involved?"

<center><h2>Back Page story from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>Brinkley Agrees Media are Liberal<br>
Paula Zahn is "Overloaded"</h3>
<p>
In a December 7 appearance on CNBC's Cal Thomas, David Brinkley reacted with dismay when read a quote from the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1995: The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
Thomas, one of the judges who voted on which quotes deserved inclusion in the year-end issue, asked: "Could you get away, for example, with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a major network anchor of Pat Buchanan...`You've got political enemies out there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the kind of ideologically loaded stuff that turns a lot of people off, isn't it?"
<p>
Brinkley agreed: "That is so loaded, it's overloaded and it destroys itself in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously, I wouldn't even bother to answer it." Though Brinkley didn't know it, the quote, first runner-up for the "Damn Those Conservatives Award," came from Paula Zahn's July 5 CBS This Morning interview.
<p>
Earlier in the show the former NBC anchor and current This Week host acknowledged liberal bias."Well, it's there and it doesn't show itself in everything that is printed or broadcast but it is there, and I think we're all used to it, we discount it. Some of the press also is more conservative and it's just the way the action is in this country and I don't know any way to change it. You just have to live with it."

<center><h2>Revoving Door, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>If You Can't Boost 'Em...</h3>
<p>
Just weeks after writing a piece for The New Republic denouncing Republican efforts to shut down AmeriCorps, Newsweek Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Steven Waldman decided he could do more good helping run the government program than he could as an external advocate. In mid-January he became senior adviser for policy planning and evaluation for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.), the new Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Service, overseer of AmeriCorps and VISTA. 
<p>
Waldman "explained that the program's recent change in leadership convinced him that the move would be ethical even though he's written extensively about the program," National Journal reported.
<p>
"Republican attacks on AmeriCorps have been bizarrely hyperbolic," Waldman charged in the November 13 New Republic. "The GOP has also practiced gross statistics-abuse in order to portray AmeriCorps, inaccurately, as a boondoggle." He predicted that "when Republicans calm down and start picking bits of safety net from their teeth, they will undoubtedly feel silly. They will realize that AmeriCorps -- which gives college scholarships to young men and women who do full-time community service -- was the solution to their dilemma of how to dismantle the welfare state without seeming cruel."
<p>
Earlier in 1995 Waldman, part of Newsweek's Washington bureau since 1987, wrote The Bill, a book detailing the creation of AmeriCorps. It grew out of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the program for the September 20, 1993 Newsweek, in which he concluded: "John F. Kennedy attracted to his Peace Corps a narrow group of mostly white, well-educated Americans. Clinton's plan is far more ambitious, seeking to regenerate fragmented American communities and break down rock-hard barriers of the heart. Because Clinton must confront the emotional issues of race and class, he is more likely to fail. But should he succeed, Clinton will have accomplished something far more significant than his hero ever did."
<p>
AmeriCorps is hardly the only area in which Waldman has been a liberal advocate. He co-authored a September 19, 1994 piece headlined, "The Lost Chance" with the subhead, "The Clintons: Newsweek reveals how they set out to reform a broken health care system -- and squandered a historic opportunity." One impediment: those who spent money "on blatantly untrue advertisements meant to scare the public."
<p>
A few issues later his byline accompanied a story on the Contract with America: "The problem is that the Contract's main idea has already been tried and discredited. House Republicans are now pledged to tax cuts, increased defense spending, and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Sound familiar? `This was a dopey political move,' [Rep. Fred] Grandy says. `We were holding the high ground on welfare, foreign policy, so why would we go back and shoosh down the Laffer Curve? This is like giving the Democrats a nuclear weapon.'" 
<p>

<h3>Being Frank</h3>
<p>
A CNN veteran is the new Deputy Press Secretary to Senator Frank Lautenberg. Ken Jaques, an off-air reporter in the CNN political unit from 1992 to 1994, has come aboard the New Jersey Democrat's staff, Roll Call reported December 21.

<p>
<h3>Networks Mourn Victims of Second Shutdown, Single Out Republicans for Blame<br>
Same Liberal Song, Second Verse</h3>
<p>
As a second partial government shutdown descended on Washington, network coverage once again favored President Clinton's arguments  over those of House Republicans. Last month, MediaWatch examined coverage during the November 13-20 shutdown and found not a single story noted how much more than the GOP  Clinton wanted to spend. No story questioned his rhetoric about "destroying" Medicare even though the GOP plan called for hikes. Reporters conveyed the Democratic spin about the disastrous impact upon federal workers and the public.
<p>
As a new budget impasse began in mid-December, MediaWatch analysts reviewed all 131 budget-related stories on evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World News) from the evening before the shutdown (December 14) through the day it ended (January 5).
<p>
After President Clinton vetoed several spending bills, not one story blamed Clinton for the shutdown, but nearly two dozen declared the GOP culpable. Furloughed workers and other "victims" were featured in half the stories while no story explored the "Washington Monument" stategy or the financial boost offered by a balanced budget.
<p>
Blame. To fund the government, Congress passes appropriation bills which the President must then sign. Clinton vetoed spending bills on December 18 and 19 that would have kept open six cabinet departments. But on the question of who caused the shutdown, reporters exclusively pointed a finger at the Republicans. In the 48 stories in which reporters allocated blame, 23 assigned blame to the Republicans, but not one held Clinton culpable (25 blamed both).
<p>
On December 16, when the government's temporary spending authority ran out, Bob Schieffer led off the CBS Evening News like a disappointed father: "Well, they've done it again. Nine days from Christmas, Republicans have forced another partial shutdown of the government because they cannot come to an agreement with the White House on how to balance the budget." The next night, ABC's Jerry King also blamed the GOP. "There's no indication from House Republicans, whose budget-cutting zeal started all of this, that they are ready, Christmas season or not, to end it."
<p>
During the negotiations that followed the vetoes, reporters repeatedly blamed Republicans for not compromising. On December 23 CNN's Wolf Blitzer pined for an earlier time: "In the old days, the two sides would simply have split the differences, but House Republicans say they are proud to be revolutionaries...From the White House perspective there's still one very big wild card: the most militant House Republicans say they're in no mood to compromise. The question remains whether Speaker Gingrich can reign them in, or wants to."
<p>
Even as Clinton delayed agreement by breaking his promises to release a seven-year balanced budget, the networks still blamed the GOP. ABC's Peter Jennings intoned on January 4, "We begin in Washington tonight, where the Republicans and the Clinton administration may be inching their way towards a partial resolution of the government shutdown. President Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress have been meeting almost daily this week, but today the Republicans apparently felt the need to reassess their position, which has kept a quarter of a million government employees off the job."
<p>
Spending. None of the 131 stories compared the higher levels of spending both sides proposed. Only two mentioned the levels of spending in the President's plan or the Republican plan, one coming not in a news story, but in a CBS commentary by Joe Klein.
<p>
Federal Workers. Only 280,000 workers were placed on furlough, just 15 percent of the work force. Still, the media focused on the issue in nearly half the stories (62), while only three reports focused on overburdened taxpayers. ABC's John Martin examined those angry at the de facto paid vacation on December 18: "This time government workers have an added worry -- Congress has been hearing from people who do not want to pay furloughed workers as they were paid after last month's shutdown."
<p>
"Victims." Sixty-seven of 131 stories mentioned a victim of the shutdown. Thirty stories called attention to families being turned away from National Parks or Smithsonian Museums. On December 22, CBS looked at how the stalemate canceled a re-creation of an Olde English Christmas banquet. John Blackstone reported, "For thousands of people, a Christmas dream is a traditional Christmas in Yosemite National Park. But the budget stalemate has closed the park gates and Yosemite's old fashioned Christmas is slipping away....The valley has somehow been drained of a seasonal joy it's known for almost 70 years." Although not by a reporter, in this story both sides were blamed as one of the participants wrote a poem about the cancellation in which she referred to Newt Gingrich as "slimebucket" and Clinton as "sleaze."
<p>
"Washington Monument." Not one report brought up the "Washington Monument" game being played when high profile services, like national parks and passport offices are closed in order to maximize inconvenience. No report questioned why these services were stopped even though, as The Wall Street Journal found, one-third of the federal workers at the Interior Department and two-thirds of State Department employees were considered essential and thus were on the job. 
<p>
Upside to the Shutdown. If you relied exclusively on the evening news, you would never have thought there was an upside to the shutdown. Only twice did a report call attention to a positive effect of the shutdown. Both were on CNN and dealt with the airline ticket tax expiring at the end of 1995. Anchor Linden Soles announced on January 1, "Washington's budget battle has reaped a windfall for air travelers," saving these travelers $12 million a day. But NBC anchor Brian Williams saw just the opposite the same day: "We have this footnote to the mess here in Washington tonight, because of it a tax on domestic airline tickets expired at midnight so while the budget negotiators are arguing about the best way to save money, the government is actually losing money."
<p>
Similarly, never mentioned were the benefits of a balanced budget. The Washington Post reported January 4 that experts estimated a balanced budget would give $1,000 annually to families through lower interest rates.  
<p>
For years, the media have complained about politicians ducking the tough issues; debating slogans, not substance. Finally, a substantive policy dispute presents itself. Unfortunately, the media aren't able to overcome their biases and look beyond the very bumper sticker politics they formerly decried.

ABC Promotes A Green "Demonstration" That Didn't Happen, Ignores March for Life
<p>
The Evangelical Right Wing That Wasn't 
<p>
Pro-life activists gather together in the nation's capital every January 22 to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. This year, 60,000 came to Washington for the annual March for Life, but the networks didn't pay much attention.
<p>
NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News each gave the event 19 seconds. CBS followed up with a long story about the federal investigation into anti-abortion violence. CNN also had an anchor brief, although reporter Anthony Collings did a story the night before. On the day of the march, CNN's Inside Politics didn't mention the march, but devoted more than seven minutes to an interview with pro-choice Republicans Ann Stone and Julie Finley.
<p>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't even mention the march. But just nine days later, on January 31, Peter Jennings announced a "major demonstration on behalf of the environment designed to pressure those congressional Republicans who wish to eliminate or dilute many of the country's environmental laws. ABC's Barry Serafin reports that the pressure comes from a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters." For ignoring the march of religious conservatives against abortion and then promoting the activities of a small group of religious liberals as if they were conservatives, ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
Serafin explained: "Protecting the environment is a relatively new issue for evangelical Christians. But a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network [EEN] says it will spend a million dollars on a campaign to block efforts by congressional conservatives to weaken the Endangered Species Act, starting with a television commercial in 18 states." ABC aired a section of the ad which asserted: "The Endangered Species Act has rescued dozens of God's creatures from extinction. But today, the Act itself is threatened."
<p>
Serafin added that the group encouraged children to write letters lobbying Newt Gingrich to stop the GOP bill, before concluding: "The evangelical delegation in Washington delivered some of the children's letters, but it was unable to meet with Gingrich today. Gingrich's position on the Endangered Species Act is still a question. A bigger question is how congressional conservatives will deal with opposition from those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
ABC's report was grossly misleading for a number of reasons. Despite Jennings' insistence, there was no "major demonstration." ABC showed no video of a demonstration, only a shot of a few professionals in overcoats walking outside the Capitol. In other words, ABC had ignored a major demonstration of 60,000 pro-lifers, only to cover one that did not even occur. The Environmental Information Center (EIC), which other news accounts identified as the million-dollar funder behind the evangelical group's ads against GOP reform of the Endangered Species Act, told MediaWatch there was no demonstration, only a press conference. 
<p>
In an August 19, 1995 Washington Post story about the activities of the liberal environmental groups Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra Club to stop Republican proposals to strengthen the rights of property owners, reporter Gary Lee noted the liberal strategy behind the founding of EIC: "The major conservation groups and a few private donors and foundations pooled their resources last spring to create the Environmental Information Center, a new lobbying organization charged with doing whatever it takes to stop the anti-environmental tide in Washington." 
<p>
The Post noted EIC spent $1.3 million during last year's House debate on regulatory reform on TV ads saying "Don't let Congress roll back 25 years of environmental progress." But ABC identified these liberal activists as "a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters" and "those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
Not only has the Environmental Evangelical Network taken sides on the environmental issues, it has taken sides against the religious right as well. The February 1 San Diego Union Tribune noted EEN leaders "were critical of the environmental stands of some conservative Christian groups, such as the politically influential Christian Coalition." ABC aired a soundbite of Ron Sider, President and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action, the EEN's parent organization. But they did not note he signed a document last May called the "Cry for Renewal." The primary authors of the letter, leftist Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis and Clinton friend Tony Campolo, declared their intention to create a "progressive evangelical caucus" to challenge traditionally conservative evangelical events and hold town meetings to address community problems like "gay bashing." ABC did not reconcile Sider's partisan press conference with his signature on the "Cry for Renewal" document, which declared "religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as religion."
<p>
ABC denigrated Republican stands with pejorative adjectives ("eliminate," "dilute," "weaken") without allowing the GOP to explain their side of the debate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) issued a press release the day after the ABC telecast asking the Evangelical Environmental Network to be honest in their characterization of the Republican bill, which currently has 126 co-sponsors in the House. Among the major provisions of the bill is an actual increase in funding for Endangered Species Act programs. 
<p>
ABC's blindness to opposing views extended to free-market environmental experts like Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who told MediaWatch the Young-Pombo bill "doesn't go nearly far enough. They tried to pre-emptively compromise, and Gingrich is seeking to water it down further. The Republicans are not guilty of what they're accused of."
<p>
Sugg added: "The Young-Pombo bill is a step in the right direction since it weakens the federal government's power over private land use. But the current Endangered Species Act has created perverse incentives for property owners to remove any possibility of endangered species appearing on their property. It creates an enmity between wildlife and land owners. The ESA's supporters care more about saving the act than saving wildlife." 
<p>
Serafin did not return phone calls to discuss his story. ABC's story contrast suggests the irony of their biases. Their focus suggests heart-tugging concern for the kangaroo rat, but not the unborn child. ABC sometimes labels the religious right as "ultraconservative," but the religious left receives no label, or worse yet, is portrayed as conservative. But the worst characteristic of their reporting is the absolute refusal to acknowledge that issues they advance with partisan passion have more than one side.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Tricky Dick's Tax Break.</h3>
When Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) filed an ethics complaint against House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt for possibly illegally evading capital gains taxes on a land swap, the story's hypocrisy angle seemed obvious. Insight reported last summer that Gephardt, who dem-agogues against capital gains tax cuts as windfalls for the rich, listed a beachfront property he was purchasing as an investment property, thus avoiding tax on a $79,500 capital gain. To obtain a loan to build on the North Carolina property, he signed a covenant pledging the house would be used as a second home, and not as an investment property. 
<p>
Reporters had two chances to make Gephardt's hypocrisy a news story, one when Dunn filed the complaint February 2, and another when Gephardt's lawyer denied the allegations a week later. Despite short stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times, in both cases the network evening news programs completely ignored the allegations.
<p>

<h3>Newt Left Hanging.</h3>
Last July, when the National Republican Congressional Committee printed a Wanted poster featuring targeted Democrats, CNN thoroughly covered the ensuing outrage from Democrats. The NRCC Wanted poster merely pictured Democratic incumbents up for re-election in 1996. CNN gave the most coverage overall of the poster, airing stories on the July 10 and July 15 Inside Politics as well as on World News for July 12 and 13. Declared anchor Bobbie Battista: "Some of the Democrats pictured on a Republican Wanted poster are complaining the ad is racist and could even put their lives in danger." The next day anchor Linden Soles reported, "Democrats say the poster is racist, anti-semitic and could even lead to physical attacks against them." 
<p>
So where was CNN when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted a Hangman game on its Web site that depicted Newt Gingrich as hanging from a gallows? According to John Pitney in the January 29 Weekly Standard, "For each correct guess, the site added a new part to a stick figure and displayed a different quotation from Gingrich. At the end of the game, the screen showed the stick figure hanging from a gallows, above the game's magic word: EXTREMIST." Surely, the lynching of the Speaker of the House on an official DNC computer Web page deserved at least a brief spot. But neither CNN's Inside Politics or The World Today aired a report on the Hangman game. A review of the three other major networks showed they also failed to mention the DNC's ghoulish depiction of Gingrich on the gallows.
<p>

<h3>PBS on Privates.</h3>
Are the personal lives of politicians relevant? Apparently, the PBS answer is "only if they're Republicans." On January 16, the tax-funded documentary series Frontline devoted an hour to the rise of Newt Gingrich, which included tales of how friends had to raise money to feed Newt's kids because he wouldn't pay alimony. Frontline also aired a man heckling Gingrich at a book signing: "You profess family values. This is hidden wisdom in the Holy Bible. And I want to know where it says oral sex doesn't count as adultery. I'd like you to sign it because, you know, you've been cheating on your wife. You've been crying family values. I don't know where it says oral sex is moral while you're trying to take away children's rights and children's benefits." 
<p>
But Frontline has almost completely avoided dealing with Bill Clinton's sex life. The only snippet came on March 3, 1992, in a documentary on racist David Duke, who declared: "I am not a wizard under the sheets. I have to leave that title to Bill Clinton from Arkansas." But that's about it. The October 21, 1992 Frontline titled "The Choice," a two-hour history of Bush and Clinton, leaped at the very end from Clinton's announcement speech in 1991 to the Los Angeles riots. There was no Gennifer Flowers. In 1995, Frontline aired "What Happened to Bill Clinton?" The answer: He hadn't been liberal enough. PBS said nothing about the allegations of state troopers or the sexual harassment lawsuit of Paula Jones. 
<p>

<h3>Another Travelgate Yawn.</h3>
While promoting her new book in January, First Lady Hillary Clinton defended her role in the May 1993 firing of the White House Travel Office staff. She said "financial mismanagement" justified the action. But a  recent audit by the General Accounting Office shows that whatever the situation in 1993, it has only gotten worse.
<p>
According to an Associated Press story that appeared in the January 30 Washington Post and Washington Times, an audit by the General Accounting Office found: "The current travel office rarely follows its own policy of paying vendors, such as airlines and telephone companies, within 45 days of the invoice date....office employees never balanced checkbooks from January through August 1995." The audit also found that the office's accounts receivable had soared to $5.6 million under the new management, while the employees that were fired had only $366,000. The new employees also forgot to enter over $200,000 in deposits into the office's checking accounts.
<p>
The audit drew little national media attention. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all failed to report the embarrassing revelations. With the exception of the NewsHour on PBS, no network evening news show ran a story. Neither did Time or Newsweek.
<p>

<h3>Hillary's Decade of Greed.</h3>
Newsweek's Martha Brant and Evan Thomas analyzed the duality of Hillary Clinton in the January 15 issue. Instead of condemning her as a hypocrite for trashing the "greed is good" 1980s in public while cashing in on her influence in private, the Newsweek duo marveled at her "missionary zeal" as a liberal crusader. "The same zeal that is so impressive in her fight for worthy causes," Brant and Thomas suggested, "can also lead her (at best) to be politically insensitive and (at worst) to be ruthless about getting her way." 
<p>
The article shows why Hillary never resorted to ruthlessness when dealing with the press on Whitewater; reporters like Brant and Thomas are willing to rationalize her behavior: "It has fallen mostly to Hillary to finance the Clinton's public service. (As governor, her husband never earned more than $35,000 a year.) To the outside world, her commodities trading -- a $1,000 investment to make $100,000 -- looks suspiciously cozy. And the family's lost investment in the failed Whitewater land development has the smell of a sweet deal turned sour...Although she would never admit it, she may feel that she was relatively restrained in Little Rock, given the temptations of her position and the culture of the place. For a governor's wife who was also a senior partner in a politically connected law firm, the opportunity for lucrative deals must have been huge."
<p>
Zuckerman's Zero Interest. Liberals often claim that media owners push the media to the right. Not so at U.S. News & World Report where owner Mortimer Zuckerman liked investigating George Bush, but is not so happy about probing the Clintons. Zuckerman used a two-page editorial on January 29 to lambaste Republican handling of the Whitewater hearings. He recalled Joseph Welch's famous dictum, "Have you no sense of decency?" from the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s as he regurgitated the Clintons' public relations line that a report prepared for the RTC by former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens cleared the Clintons. On the issue of the billing records that were discovered nearly two years after being subpoenaed (and which contradict the RTC report), Zuckerman wrote: "What about the time sheets showing the amount of legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S&L?...Again, no. Her role...was minimal." 
<p>
The editorial led to a January 26 guest appearance on Michael Jackson's KABC talk show in Los Angeles. Talk Daily reported that "he called the charges against the Clintons `outrageous' (a term he used several times)," claimed that in the First Lady's Madison dealings "all transactions were legitimate," was "disgusted" by the investigation and considered much of the press coverage a "witch hunt." 
<p>
Zuckerman's U.S. News piece also attacked fellow journalists for investigating a Democrat: "The press has slipped its moorings here...The two questions now -- what did the President's wife know and when did she know it? -- seem a childish irrelevance by comparison [to Watergate]." However in his own June 22, 1992 editorial on Iraqgate, Zuckerman suggested the Bush administration obstructed justice, claiming: "Certainly the attempts to limit inquiries by Congress on the spurious grounds of national security smell of coverup....In short, what did the administration know and when did it know it?"
<p>

<h3>California Scheming. </h3>
Host Jane Pauley's introduction to the January 23 Dateline NBC dripped with sarcasm: "Do you feel that everyone is after your job, and they just might have an unfair advantage? That people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male? In California, two men have taken up the cause of the beleaguered species. They've written a ballot proposal that, if passed in November, would change affirmative action in California's state hiring and education admissions." Reporter Josh Mankiewicz charged, "They (Glynn Custred and Tom Wood) are portrayed as `genial scholars,' just two `apolitical professors,' an image Wood and Custred have worked hard to maintain."
<p>
Then Mankiewicz moved to discredit them: "The two are key figures in a conservative organization...very critical of many aspects of higher education, including black and women's studies, sexual harassment policies, the emphasis on racial diversity, and affirmative action." John Leo of U.S. News & World Report took exception to the Mankiewicz segment in the February 19 issue: "Senator Joe himself couldn't have phrased this better. It artfully left the impression that NAS [the National Association of Scholars, to which Wood and Custred belong] is a sinister, antiwoman, antiblack group." In fact, Leo noted that "a prominent Marxist, Eugene Genovese, sits on the board of advisers."
<p>
Mankiewicz criticized the men for not having statistics on how many white men have suffered discrimination, but Leo pointed out "Nobody has good statistics on this. Since a lot of reverse discrimination is legal under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act], many who are hurt by it never bother to file any complaints and thus don't get counted."
<p>

<h3>Judge Baer Not Bared.</h3>
<p>
When Federal Judge Harold Baer threw out the key evidence  in a New York drug arrest, $4 million in cocaine and heroin, only one news magazine noted that the Clinton administration had appointed the judge. All four networks ran stories on the case, explaining how the judge tossed the evidence, which officers found in a duffel bag they earlier saw being placed inside a car, under the guise of it being obtained through an illegal search. A story on NBC's February 6 Dateline noted that the woman charged admitted to being a drug runner and that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) now regretted suggesting Baer be nominated. But none of the networks noted the Clinton link. 
<p>
U.S. News & World Report was the only news magazine to make the connection between Clinton and Baer. However reporter Ted Gest, writing in the February 12 issue, failed to tie Baer's ruling with any liberal leanings. Analyzing the administration's judicial choices, he wrote, "Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are moderates, and so are most of his lower court appointees...Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson...stresses diversity without sacrificing quality." Quality that let a $4 million admitted drug trafficker go free.

<center><h2>Front Page story, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>CBS Reporter Bernard Goldberg Charges Colleague, <br>Media with Liberal Bias
Reality Check for Eric Engberg</h3></center>
<p>
This month MediaWatch planned to include an article about CBS reporter Eric Engberg's February 8 CBS Evening News "Reality Check" attack on Steve Forbes' flat tax. But one of Engberg's colleagues beat us to it. In an unprecedented February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said that "Mr. Engberg's report set new standards for bias." Reaction was swift: CBS News President Andrew Heyward tagged the charge "absurd." 
<p>
Goldberg began by observing that one reason fewer people are watching network news "is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters."
<p>
Reciting the story, he noted that Engberg showed Forbes saying the "economy can grow twice as fast if we remove `obstacles,' starting with the tax code. Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is. `Time Out!' he shouts in his signature style. `Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.'"  
<p>
Next, Engberg showed Forbes asserting "A flat tax would enable the economy to grow. That would mean more revenue for Washington." To that "Engberg tells the audience: `That was called supply- side economics under President Reagan. Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't work out that way.'" Engberg then allowed an economist from the Brookings Institution, which he failed to label as liberal, to predict the same thing would happen again. 
<p>
Goldberg wondered: "But haven't other experts argued that we wound end up with `hideous deficits' not because of the tax cut but because of increased spending?"
<p>
Engberg offered this snide hit: "OK, how about Forbes' number one wackiest flat tax promise?" In a clip, Forbes explained how "parents would have more time to spend with their children, and with each other." Goldberg queried, "can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan `wacky?'" Engberg concluded: "The fact is, the flat tax is one giant untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania." 
<p>
"Reality Check," Goldberg explained, "suggests the viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania."

<h3>Networks Scared of Flat Tax<br>
Furious At Forbes</h3>
<p>
The higher Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes rose in the polls, the more reporters felt compelled to discredit his flat tax proposal, often by trying to stir class envy.
<p>
In the February 8 Investor's Business Daily reporter Thomas McArdle uncovered the agenda. In mid-January ABC News interviewed Alvin Rabushka, a Senior Fellow with the Hoover Institution and an architect of the flat tax idea, for a Peter Jennings piece. 
Rabushka told McArdle that "the cameras rolled for an hour, and throughout the hour, over and over again, he kept trying to get me to agree it would be a tax on the middle class, if not in the long run, then at least in the interim period. And over and over I wouldn't say it." Rabushka concluded that Jennings just wanted to "get me to say the 18-second soundbite he wanted to use to discredit Steve Forbes."
<p>
Indeed, Rabushka did not appear in Jennings' January 15 World News Tonight story in which he tagged the flat tax as "a very radical notion." Jennings wondered "Will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats? President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction. And charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible. Certainly the rich would do better than the middle class."
<p>
Two days later NBC's Mike Jensen looked at three families, concluding as fact: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent. So not only would it fail to help the poor, it would increase taxes for most middle class Americans."
<p>
Nightline devoted its February 1 edition to a 30-minute assault. Robert Krulwich went through four supposed benefits of the flat tax, concluding each was wrong. As for fairness, he decided that "it doesn't seem fair that while" millionaire candidate Morry Taylor "pays zero tax on his $15 million" in stock sales, "his employees -- because they're not getting stock, they're on a salary -- they pay a 17 percent tax on their money; but that's what happens when you eliminate capital gains."
<p>
As for whether it's simpler, Krulwich decided it's not because not everyone will really be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Moving on to the third claim of lower taxes for everyone, he countered: "Sounds wonderful, but then Forbes' tax helps some more than others, especially wealthy families. Still, somebody must lose and the government could be the big loser. Forbes' tax could cut government revenues by $40 billion a year or $180 billion, depending upon who you ask, which means deeper cuts in programs" or bigger deficits.
<p>
On the last claim, that it "will be good for the economy," he explained how "Forbes is an old-fashioned, kick-up-your-heels optimist. He believes if you don't tax savings, people will save a lot more. If you don't tax investment income, people will invest a lot more, and in the end, the economy will grow a lot more." He countered that "history does not bless Steve Forbes' optimism." For the rest of the show Ted Koppel interviewed two opponents: Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson and the magazine's Wall Street editor Allan Sloan, who sneered, "when I first heard it, I almost fell on the floor laughing wondering how anyone could take it seriously."

<h3>Global Warming Shtick Returns<br>
The Heat Is Off </h3>
<p>
Snow in Arizona, ice in Mississippi, and record low temperatures in between? It must be global warming. So said Newsweek's January 22 cover story: "The Hot Zone: Blizzards, Floods, & Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming."
<p>
Senior Writer Sharon Begley promoted Goddard Institute scientist James Hansen (an early and influential exponent of global warming). The story included a graph claiming, "The average surface temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees in the last 135 years."
<p>
Begley noted how some scientists are skeptical, but didn't detail their evidence. Instead, she concluded by endorsing Hansen's theory of immenent climate change, writing "to many people trudging along streets lined with urban Himalayas last week, it already has."
Reporter Bob Dotson fingered the same suspect to explain the weather on the February 2 Dateline NBC: "Despite the cold, last year was the hottest on record. Mix those two extremes, says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, and stir with global warming." Dotson failed to tell viewers that Oppeheimer is a long-time promoter of warming scenarios for the liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
<p>
Both got their data from the University of East Anglia, whose climate researchers anointed 1995 the warmest year ever after measuring the Earth's surface temperature for the first 11 months of data, making an "educated guess" about December.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
Reporter Kathy Sawyer in the January 26 Washington Post pointed out "Temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummeted in December by almost 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit," a drop "unprecedented in the 17-year satellite record." She cited figures from NOAA, whose satellite data showed that out of 17 years included in their research, "1995 was only about the eighth-warmest year." 
Ronald Bailey, producer of Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank on PBS wrote in the February 5 Weekly Standard that "One climate scientist at NASA speculated that the East Anglia group was afraid that if they waited, December temperatures might plummet and they'd lose their opportunity for a scary headline." Bailey suggested a more accurate headline: "'95 Eighth-Warmest Year on Record."

<h3>Knowledgeable Limbaugh Dittoheads<br>
Not The Media Caricature</h3>
<p>
In his just published book, Hot Talk: All Talk, All the Time, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz argues that talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh, has a corrosive effect on society as hosts heighten division and spread misinformation. But a new poll by Kurtz' own newspaper found that listening to Limbaugh may be the antidote, not the cause, of public ignorance as his listeners are among the best informed Americans.
<p>
A major Washington Post survey revealed an incredible level of ignorance as 40 percent of the public could not name the Vice President, 47 percent failed to identify the House Speaker, 66 percent had no idea who is U.S. Senate Majority Leader, 94 percent were unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and 58 percent thought the U.S. spends more on foreign aid than Medicare. 
<p>
But Limbaugh listeners are in a better league. As the Post noted January 29, "They are much more knowledgeable than most about what goes on inside the Beltway and, although they are among the least trusting of the federal government, they are also among the most politically engaged voters." Over 80 percent are registered voters, "compared to only a quarter of non-dittoheads."
<p>
The poll demonstrated just how far off the mark reporters have been. In a January 1995 NBC Nightly News Bob Faw asked whether "talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run amok." Writing a Washington Post book review last May former CBS and NBC reporter Marvin Kalb charged: "Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usual robust, sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." 
<p>
Six in ten Limbaugh listeners "have very little confidence in the news media." Sounds like dittoheads have a better understanding of the media than the media have of them.

<h2><center>Revolving Door from the February 1996 MediaWatch</center></h2>
<p>
<h3>NBC Goes Left with Moyers</h3>
<p>
Three months after the electorate rejected liberal policies, NBC News decided to hire Bill Moyers, a Democratic political activist and left-wing crusader on PBS since leaving CBS News in 1986, to offer commentary on its third place Nightly News. A Deputy Director of the Peace Corps and Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, Moyers began his new duties on February 14, though he will continue his PBS work. NBC has no plans to provide a conservative counter-weight.
<p>
The New York Times relayed February 1 that NBC News President Andy Lack dismissed questions about Moyers' liberal bias at PBS, insisting "that perception is inside the beltway, and perhaps inside about ten blocks of New York and ten blocks of L.A. I don't think the American people give a whit about it." The same day the Baltimore Sun quoted Moyers: "I'm not in politics. I have no agenda. I'm not pushing a platform. I have no ideology."
<p>
Really? In a 1989 Esquire profile Moyers tagged Newt Gingrich "Joe McCarthy with a southern accent." Some other non-ideological quotes:
<p>
From a March 1991 address to the Democratic Issues Conference: "I was raised on mother's milk and Roosevelt speeches, and over the years, I still cherish the party's defining stands." Taking on Democrats from the left, he charged: "By the 1980s, when the Democrats in Congress colluded with Ronald Reagan and the Republicans to revise the tax code on behalf of the rich, it appeared the party had lost its soul."
<p>
In comments during the 1992 PBS press tour: "What liberalism is, is a belief that a democracy like ours has to be tolerant. Has to open itself to ideas, that the answer to a bad idea is a better idea. Civility. I mean, I'd like to think that's what liberalism is. I define myself in that sense as a liberal." On conservatives: "I find it very hard to have intelligent conversations with people on the right wing because they want to hit first and ask questions later. And I just simply don't let that criticism set my agenda." 
<p>
From a September 1991 Washington Post Magazine interview: "The right gets away with blaming liberals for their efforts to help the poor, but what the right is really objecting to is the fact that the poor are primarily black. The man who sits in the White House today [George Bush] opposed the Civil Rights Act. So did Ronald Reagan. This crowd is really fighting a retroactive civil rights war to prevent the people they dislike because of their color from achieving success in American life."
<p>
After Mario Cuomo's 1992 Democratic convention speech, he declared on CNN: "It's worth dying prematurely so you can hear someone else do your eulogy if that someone is Mario Cuomo."
<p>
Following a 1989 PBS re-broadcast of his 1982 CBS Reports: People Like Us, he insisted: "The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The hardest-hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-poverty measures. Even programs that were not cut have failed to keep up with inflation. Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And the middle class kept most of their subsidies intact. As a result, the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."
<p>
In his 1992 PBS show Listening to America, he asked candidate Bill Clinton: "What do you think the American people get for their government? We have no universal health care, we have no federal guarantee of higher education...The regulatory agencies in many cases have been gutted...Why not just say `We will have universal health care and we will raise taxes to pay for it?'"  
Sounds like he'll feel quite comfortable reporting to NBC Nightly News Executive Producer Jeff Gralnick, Press Secretary to then-Senator George McGovern in 1972.

<h3>A Social Problem Blamed on Reaganomics Fades Away in Clinton-Era Media Coverage<br>
The Incredible Shrinking Homeless</h3>
<p>
The poor may have always been with us, but the network news has often presented homelessness as a problem created by the Reagan adminstration. 
<p>
"In the 1980s, the Reagan years, the amount of government money spent to build low-income housing was cut drastically. Then the homeless began to appear on streets and in doorsteps and housing became a visible human problem," proclaimed then-NBC anchor Garrick Utley on November 3, 1990. ABC's John Martin told the same tale in reporting a 1989 homelessness march: "They staged the biggest rally on behalf of the homeless since the Reagan revolution forced severe cutbacks in government housing programs."
<p>
It mattered little that budget experts John Cogan and Timothy Muris noted in The American Enterprise in 1990 that "while budget authority for subsidized housing programs declined 77 percent (from 1981-89), the number of subsidized units and the number of families living in those units increased by one-third." Reporter Harold Dow recycled the same old media spin on the March 26, 1991 CBS Evening News: "In New York there are an estimated 70,000 homeless people, three million across America. A problem that got a lot worse during the boom times of the 1980s."      
<p>
So now that Bill Clinton has been in office for three years, has the ever-growing problem of homelessness continued to burden the White House? Or did the problem recede from the media's agenda? MediaWatch analysts used the MRC Media Tracking System to count the number of network evening news segments on homelessness in America on the four evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's Prime News or World News). Analysts found the problem faded from the  list of priorities. In the Bush years (1989-1992), the number of homeless stories per year averaged 52.5, but in the first three years of the Clinton administration, the average dropped to 25.3 stories a year.
<p>
During the Bush administration, the story count grew from 44 in 1989 to a peak of 71 in 1990, followed by 54 stories in 1991 and 43 in 1992. By contrast, stories on America's homeless dipped slightly to 35 stories in 1993, and 32 in 1994. In 1995, the number fell dramatically to just nine. When the count is broken down by network, CNN had the widest gap in reporting during the Bush years and Clinton years (90-30), closely followed by ABC (45-16), CBS (41-15), and NBC (36-15).
<p>
But the numbers alone do not tell the whole story. The decline in homeless coverage coincided with the lessening of unsupported statistics about the size of the homeless population. CNN anchor Lou Waters announced on August 8, 1989: "A new research report is warning that homelessness in this country could easily double or triple if there is a mild recession...there now are up to 40 million Americans living on the knife edge of homelessness, just one paycheck, one domestic argument from the streets."
<p>
The willingness to wildly extrapolate the number of America's homeless began to change slightly in 1991, when the Census Bureau's partial count of the homeless in shelters and on the street reported an estimate of 220,000 homeless Americans. All four networks reported on the Census count the night it occurred (March 20, 1990). But when the Census Bureau released its official report announcing a count of 220,000 on April 12, 1991, only CNN reported it. ABC referred to the estimate on May 9, but only to note that congressional sources claimed the estimate was "meaningless."
<p>
While the stories in the Bush era regularly blamed Republican administrations, not one of the 75 homeless stories in the last three years has placed any blame on the Clinton administration. On January 21, 1993, ABC featured a report on the gaudiness of the Clinton inauguration, which reporter Judy Muller concluded: "The Republicans were criticized for their show of wealth in the face of need. The Democrats seemed to have avoided such criticism. Perhaps because President Clinton has promised to help those less fortunate. For now, not many people seem to begrudge Bill Clinton his night on the town, considering the sobering realities he faces the morning after."
<p>
Indeed, in a March 12, 1995 NBC story, reporter Giselle Fernandez warned of the consequences if congressional Republicans succeeded in trimming spending on homeless aid programs in a small $17 billion rescission bill: "Across the nation there are an estimated 20,000 homeless families. And social workers worry the crisis will only worsen if the new Congress keeps its promise and makes deep cuts in bedrock social programs and especially in public housing." Fernandez did not explain why the networks did not blame this problem on the Clinton administration: they announced plans to spend a whopping $2.1 billion in fiscal 1995 on homeless aid, more than three times the $550 million spent in the last year of the Bush administration. To NBC, reducing this dramatic increase was a "deep cut."
<p>
The only story that MediaWatch analysts found on ABC  in 1995 was an anchor brief by Catherine Crier: "A new report today from the advocacy group Children's Defense Fund finds life for millions of American children still filled with poverty and violence. In its new yearbook, the group cites Census Bureau figures showing nearly 16 million children living in poverty last year, the highest level since 1964, and among the homeless, one in four is a child." In other words, the liberal group that used to be chaired by Hillary Clinton has noted that child poverty by one measure is the worst in thirty years, but ABC never wondered whether the Clinton administration could be at fault. 
<p>
The network trend of slowly dropping the story of homelessness, and quickly transforming the issue from an indicator of Republican economic failure to a nonpartisan social problem, suggests that politics more than journalism is at play. Homelessness served as a negative campaign tool against the Republican intention to curb the unending growth of federal spending on social programs.

<P>
<H3>CBS Reporter Smears Pat Buchanan by Connecting Him to the Ku Klux Klan<BR>
-- McNamara Tries Guilt by Association </H3>
<P>
After newscasts highlighted the story of Larry Pratt, the Pat 
Buchanan campaign co-chairman who resigned to combat the discovery 
that he spoke in a number of forums where racists and other bigots 
appeared, liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant loaded his 
February 20 column with friendly fire: "For liberals to be silent 
simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the 
Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
If the networks wished to investigate the charge of bigotry against 
Buchanan, they had a library of columns and an archive of video 
clips to spend weeks hunting through for examples. Instead of doing 
the hard work of combing the minutiae of his paper (and TV) trail, 
the networks decided to practice guilt by association, suggesting 
his campaign appeal is too indiscriminate, too likely to appeal to 
bigots. 
<P>
In a February 23 Nightline, ABC's Ted Koppel refined the issue: 
"It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly 
anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has 
created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts 
or statements by others." Koppel not only suggested Buchanan's 
father was a regular listener to the anti-Semitic radio show of 
Father Coughlin (he later apologized when the family denied this), 
he even stooped to accusing Buchanan's little brothers of having 
beaten up Jewish kids in the 1950s.  This is odd coming from 
Koppel, who said of Bill Clinton's 1969 draft-dodging thank-you 
letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and 
thought and felt at that time would be germane."  
<P> 
Koppel ended his show with a pro-Buchanan letter from Russian 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky charging Israel controls America's 
finances "through American Jews or Negroes." Koppel concluded: 
"It's not that Buchanan hasn't expressed some of the views that 
Zhirinovsky echoed, but perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they 
sounded until he heard them in the mouth of a genuine bigot." 
For a desperate search for damaging Buchanan allies, the other 
networks could not match CBS. For finding Buchanan guilty by 
association with people he's either repudiated or never heard of, 
CBS reporter Bob McNamara won the March Janet Cooke Award.  
On the February 28 Evening News, Dan Rather began the story: "For 
his part, Buchanan vowed to come back big in the next phase of 
primaries and immediately, quote, `lit into' Forbes during a 
southern campaign swing today, lit into Forbes as too liberal. At 
the same time, Buchanan is trying to deflect criticism that he is 
an extremist, who, at the very least, uses code words to attract 
voters with racist, bigoted views. Buchanan flatly denies this. 
Correspondent Bob Mc- Namara has been looking into it." 
 <P>
McNamara moved quickly to the issue of Buchanan's fans: "They were 
waiting 3,000 strong for Pat Buchanan outside Atlanta last night. 
They say they've been waiting for years... Here, his call to take 
back the country is a crowd pleaser. But outside the campaign, 
critics charge that Buchanan's rhetoric is making this race about 
race. And the man and his ideas are now beginning to be judged by 
the company they keep." 
<P> 
McNamara explained: "Lurking in the shadows of last month's 
Louisiana campaign, there was former Klan leader David Duke." Duke 
told CBS: "I let the word out to all my supporters in the state 
that I supported Patrick Buchanan, and if Patrick goes on to win 
the nomination, I guess part of the credit will have to go to us."  
McNamara  allowed a perfunctory rebuttal: "It is not an endorsement 
Buchanan wants, and today his backers took pains to distance their 
man from charges of extremism on economics and immigration, race, 
and religion." CBS aired Buchanan backer Rabbi Aryeh Spero: "This 
is a guilt by association, which is very dangerous to our whole 
political system." 
<P>
Focusing on racism, McNamara countered: "Today, even in the New 
South, old ideas have not been completely laid to rest. And for 
people uncomfortable with the way the world has changed, Buchanan's 
message is hitting home....Danny Carver is a roofing contractor, a 
Christian, and a lifetime member of the Ku Klux Klan. He says he 
and Buchanan speak the same language." Carver told McNamara: "About 
everything he says we agree with....When he's talking about 
affirmative action he has to be talking about women and niggers, I 
guess." McNamara asked: "Do you think Buchanan would want to hear 
that you support him?" Carver replied: "He would want to hear it, 
but he don't want it on TV." 
<P>
CBS didn't explain how Carver came to their attention. He's not an 
unknown, but a self-promoting semi-regular on Howard Stern's 
syndicated radio show. Stern, who's Jewish and calls Carver a 
"lunatic," has featured him as the butt of humor on his Butt Bongo 
Fiesta video (where he struck out in the game "Guess Who's the 
Jew"), and as a judge of the topless "Miss Howard Stern" contest in  
a 1993 New Year's Eve pay-per-view special. 
<P>
McNamara concluded: "The Buchanan campaign said tonight that it 
adamantly rejects all forms of racism as immoral, saying that their 
campaign is, quote, `populated by people who embrace the sense of 
justice in the Old and New Testament.' But he has become a 
candidate battling a political Catch-22. A man who says what he 
means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of 
people who think they know exactly what he is talking about." CBS 
News spokeswoman Kim Apgar told MediaWatch "I can't speak to this. 
You need McNamara." But CBS could not locate a number where 
McNamara could be reached. 
<P>
While CBS attempted to connect Buchanan with neo-Nazis and the KKK, 
they have been critical of any look at the associations of Bill 
Clinton. In October 1992, The Washington Times and others 
investigated Clinton's role in the anti-Vietnam war movement. 
Father Richard McSorley's book Peace Eyes recounts Clinton's role 
as an organizer of a protest service that ended in a march to the 
U.S. embassy with white crosses, left "as an indication of our 
desire to end the agony of Vietnam." McSorley reported the 
protest's organizers were "Group 68 (Americans in Britain)," which 
"had the support" of the British Peace Council, a Soviet front 
group.  
<P>
After Clinton's anti-war involvement came up in the first 
presidential debate, CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith declared 
on October 12: "Clearly, that red-baiting junk didn't work last 
night." The networks aired no stories questioning "the company 
Clinton keeps" or suggesting "It's not that Clinton has signaled 
through acts or statements his support for the Soviet Union, but 
that he created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to 
such acts or statements." They called it a smear. Guilt by 
association is clearly a game reporters play on only one side.

<H3>Jack White, Smear Artist.</H3>
<P>
In an attack uglier than any of this year's attack ads, Time
national correspondent Jack E. White announced the culprits behind
black church burnings in the South. After blaming Pat Buchanan's
"ugly rhetoric" in the March 18 issue, he broadened the smear: "In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative action,
more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern and Border
states have been torched."
<P>
White noted the current lack of evidence of a racist conspiracy in
the bombings, yet concluded: "But there is already enough evidence
to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames." 
<P>
<a name=rooting>
<H3>Rooting Against Rush.</H3>
<P>
Tom Brokaw may have engaged in wishful thinking on the February 14
Nightly News when he devoted the "NBC News Online" to the alleged
fall of Rush Limbaugh. Brokaw claimed "Election results are one way
to tell who's hot in politics. Then there are the ratings in this
business." Brokaw charged that Limbaugh's "radio and television
ratings have tumbled, and his books, once huge best-sellers, now
are in the discount bins." He added a plug for the book Rush
Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot by Al Franken, a fellow NBC employee:
"And a book about Limbaugh, by the comedian Al Franken, is riding
high, it's number two behind Hillary Clinton's book and rising
fast."
<P>
But as Talkers magazine Editor Michael Harrison noted in the March
3 Washington Times, Limbaugh's ratings "dropped a marginal,
insignificant amount" in the fall. "The guy belches in ratings, and
everyone runs around as if the witch is dead," Harrison said. He
noted Limbaugh is on 650 radio stations, with a total audience more
than double his closest political talk show competition. 
<P>
Linda Cecere of the Rush Limbaugh television show told MediaWatch
there are 8.9 million copies of Limbaugh's two books currently in
print, and noted the books have spent a total of 114 weeks on the
New York Times bestseller list (hardcover and paperback). His first
book spent 24 weeks at the #1 spot. Brokaw ignored how virtually
all bestsellers with a big press run are eventually discounted.
<P>
<a name=friends>
<H3>With Friends Like These.... </H3>
<P>
During the usually contentious primary season the media focused on
Republican rifts, but ignored Democratic divisions over their party
leader. With two exceptions the networks failed to report attacks
on President Clinton from two prominent Democrats. In an interview
with Washington Post reporter Martha Sherrill in the January issue
of Esquire magazine Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) insisted:
"Clinton's an unusually good liar." Kerrey's extraordinary
admission received very little coverage. Tim Russert, prompted by
a Washington Times article, asked Colorado Gov. Roy Romer about the
Kerrey quote on the February 4 Meet the Press.
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw briefly mentioned the quote on the February 6
Inside Politics, and added the remarks of Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.) who joked of Clinton's poll ratings: "If they get up to 60
percent, his people tell me Bill can start dating again." Shaw also
relayed a Hollings quote from a South Carolina paper: "Clinton's as
popular as AIDS in South Carolina." The Hollings quotes received no
coverage in the usually AIDS-sensitive television networks of ABC,
NBC and CBS. By contrast, in December 1994 when Senator Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) joked that Clinton was so unpopular that he had better
bring bodyguards if he visited any military bases, the Helms remark
generated nine stories on the three broadcast network evening news
shows.

<P>
In the weeks following the Oklahoma City bombing, the news media
were quick to portray suspect Timothy McVeigh unsympathetically as
a violent extremist, as well they should. But when 26-year-old Lori
Berenson was sentenced to life in prison by a Peruvian military
tribunal for being closely involved with the Marxist terrorists of
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the news media tried
to portray her sympathetically as a concerned American who went to
Latin America to work for the poor. 
<P>
Although she admitted to being affiliated with the MRTA, the
January 22 Time didn't feel that was important: "Her friends and
relatives know Lori Berenson as a compassionate idealist, an
innocent waylaid by her concern for the poor and oppressed of Latin
America." Time concluded: "But Berenson's real passion was always
to help the downtrodden; as a teenager she donated time to a soup
kitchen." A February 4 Washington Post headline read: "Little Girl
Lost. American Lori Berenson, 26, Was a Good Daughter, A Good
Worker, a Good-Hearted Person. In Peru, She Got Into Trouble. Bad
Trouble." On February 21, ABC Prime Time Live reporter John
Quinones used the same approach in a story titled "To Love A
Country": "In the 8th grade, Lori volunteered to work at a soup
kitchen. Later that year she was selected to narrate a commercial
for CARE, an appeal to feed needy children."
<P>
This theme was countered by a Mark Falcoff article in the February
26 issue of The Weekly Standard: "But let the record show that she
is charged not for her views, but for her involvement with a
terrorist group that, in recent years, has been involved in
assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, robberies, and attacks
against innocent people, many of them poor."
<P>
<a name=absentees>
<H3>Ethics Absentees</H3>
<P>
The networks continue to ignore ethics complaints against
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives. In early
February, the networks saw no need for a story when Rep. Jennifer
Dunn (R-Wash.) filed a complaint with the House ethics committee
suggesting House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt may have evaded
capital gains taxes on a land swap.  
<P>
The February 23 Washington Times reported that Gephardt dumped his
share of ownership of the vacation home on North Carolina's Outer
Banks. George Archibald wrote that Gephardt, who is an avid
opponent of capital gains tax cuts, "claimed for
financial-disclosure purposes that his condo was not a rental
property the year he sold it for $183,000. He simultaneously
claimed it as a rental property for tax purposes to escape capital
gains taxes of about $17,000 in 1991." Archibald struck again with
a March 6 piece in the Washington Times noting that Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) formally requested the Justice Department undertake a
criminal probe of Gephardt's tax situation. Neither story piqued
the networks' curiosity.
<P>
On March 6, the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation filed a
complaint against House MinorityWhip David Bonior, the ethical
scold of Speaker Newt Gingrich, for misusing his congressional
staff to write a 1984 book on government time. The networks didn't
cover that either.

"This morning we're taking a close look at the problem of child
care, a problem some countries are solving," co-host Harry Smith
announced on the February 21 CBS This Morning. The country with the
solution? France and its expensive, old-style socialist system. 
<P>
Smith marveled at the state-mandated benefits: "Like all new
mothers in France, Helene took a 16-week paid maternity leave from
her job. In addition, mothers who work for larger companies can
take off two more years unpaid, with the guarantee their jobs will
still be there when they get back." To support this system, Smith
admitted that taxes are "much higher in France than in the United
States...and that may be why they're going through some of their
own economic problems." But, incredibly, he also referred to the
system as free: "When Jeanne leaves day care, she can attend a
completely free, good quality, state-run pre-school where she stays
until she is six and primary school begins."  Smith followed the
segment with an interview of Ellen Galinsky of the liberal Families
and Work Institute. His first question was more accusation: "In the
United States, are we just not willing to pay for child care?"

<H3>ABC vs. the First Amendment</H3>
<P>
A special interest group wants to use the coercive power of the
government to silence the opposition. ABC News naturally comes down
on the side of free speech, right? Not quite. Here's how Peter
Jennings introduced a February 14 World News Tonight story:
"Supporters of gun control, who had no success convincing a
Republican Congress to pass stronger gun control legislation, have
adopted a new tactic. They have asked the Federal Trade Commission
to stop certain advertisements by gun manufacturers."
<P>
Lisa Stark explained that the ads "sell safety and security,
offering guns as a way to protect loved ones, to guard home and
family. But critics say this picture is deceptive and misleading."
After a soundbite from Sarah Brady, Stark elaborated: "Gun control
advocates point to tragedies you won't find in the ads. In Texas,
a teenager shot and killed, mistaken for a burglar by her father;
in California, a four-year-old shoots himself," and a 15-year-old
"killed by his best friend." 
<P>
Stark asserted that "scientific studies show handguns are more
likely to hurt family members than protect them." ABC aired three
soundbites from opponents of the gun ads, but only one from Tanya
Metaksa of the National Rifle Association. Metaksa was only allowed
to defend the right to air ads, not to counter the liberal
statistics about gun accidents. If Stark had any interest in
balance, she could have noted that Dr. Arthur Kellerman, a fervent
gun control advocate, explained in the August 14, 1994 U.S. News &
World Report that "Studies such as ours do not include cases in
which intruders are wounded or frightened away by the use or
display of a firearm." Last year in his book Guns, David Kopel
noted that bicycle and swimming pool accidents kill more children
annually than do guns. If ABC wants the FTC to regulate
advertisements from weapon manufacturers, then who will regulate
the network's own gun control ads disguised as journalism?
<P>
<a name=episcopal>
<H3>The Episcopalian Inquisition?</H3>
<P>
The word inquisition brings to mind torture sessions in dark
castles in medieval Europe where unbelievers were strapped to the
rack until they swore allegiance to the church. Recently, the
networks used the word to describe whether the Episcopal Church
should allow a practicing homosexual minister to lead church
services.
<P>
Peter Jennings led off the rhetorical overkill about Bishop Walter
Righter on the February 27 World News Tonight: "This next story in
the news tonight may conjure the Spanish Inquisition for some but
the dateline is Wilmington, Delaware. A retired bishop could become
the second Episcopal priest in the two hundred year history of the
U.S. Episcopal Church to be tried for heresy, the most serious
breach of Christian faith. His offense: ordaining a practicing
homosexual five years ago."
<P>
On the same night's CBS Evening News, reporter Richard Threlkeld
referred to the trial as something "right out of the middle ages"
and stated that "critics charge Bishop Righter's the victim of a
conservative inquisition." The idea that conservative bishops
inside the Episcopal Church wanted to enforce church doctrine left
Threlkeld scratching his head: "It's ironic that something so
medieval should be happening within the Episcopal Church, one of
the more tolerant of Protestant denominations."

<H3>Networks Ignore Clinton Ally's Coalition-Building with Louis Farrakhan<BR>
--Reserving Rebukes for Buchanan</H3>
<P>
When the liberal Center for Public Integrity released a report
February 15 showing Larry Pratt, co-chairman of the Pat Buchanan
campaign, had attended and spoken before meetings of white
supremacists and anti-semites, it led all the network evening
newscasts. Some made Buchanan guilty by association. "Pat Buchanan
was caught today in his own crossfire with accusations that he is
running a campaign of hate and bigotry," declared Phil Jones on
CBS. 
<P>
But five days later, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore attended the
swearing in of Kweisi Mfume as President of the NAACP, the networks
refused to make an issue of Mfume's links to the Nation of Islam's
Louis Farrakhan. The four network evening shows didn't even mention
the event.
<P>
As New York Post editorial page editor Eric Breindel pointed out
February 29, Mfume "helped forge the 1993 `Sacred Covenant' between
the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mfume chaired, and Louis
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam." Surely, asked Breindel, "the
fringe-right groups with which Larry Pratt associates are no more
pernicious than the Farrakhanites." 
<P>
Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, immediately took a leave of
absence from the Buchanan campaign. "Mfume, by contrast," Breindel
noted, "hasn't manifested any inclination to distance himself from
Farrakhan....the ex-Congressman hasn't even been asked to do so."
Not even after Farrakhan praised the leaders of Libya, Iraq and
Iran during a world trip. Farrakhan accepted a $1 billion pledge
from Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi for his separatist
organization to "mobilize `oppressed' minorities to influence this
year's U.S. elections," The Washington Post reported February 17,
three days before Clinton stood beside Mfume.  
<P>
Back in the U.S., Farrakhan offered some fresh anti-semitism. In a
clip shown February 29 on Rush Limbaugh, he said: "When you bring
me before Congress, I'm going to call the roll of all the
Congressmen who are honorary members of the Israeli Knesset and get
contributions from the Zionist AIPAC, and then I want you to
register as a foreign power! Every year you give Israel $46 billion
of the taxpayers' money and you haven't asked the taxpayers one
damn thing. Who are you an agent of?"
<P>
Did reporters demand Clinton explain his support of Farrakhan
backer Mfume? No, they were too busy tarnishing Buchanan. In a
February 23 NBC Nightly News piece, Gwen Ifill proffered to
Buchanan: "People say that you are a sexist, a racist, an
anti-semite." Ifill concluded that "Buchanan fancies himself a
trench-fight-er, a warrior for a new conservatism of the heart. But
increasingly he's being judged by the company he keeps." That's not
a judgment reporters made of Clinton.

<H3>Poor, Poor OSHA</H3>
<P>
The Congress may have failed so far to pass a regulatory reform
bill, but The Washington Post is warning of the consequences of
"deregulation" nonetheless. In a four-part February 18-21 series
titled "De Facto Deregulation," Post reporters didn't so much
describe "deregulation" as they did the frustration of regulators
and their political allies at their inability to implement
additional rules.
<P>
In the first story, reporter Cindy Skrzycki did feature opinions
from the "libertarian" Cato Institute and the "conservative"
National Center for Public Policy Research, but leftist Ralph Nader
was simply a "consumer activist." Despite their prominence in  the
series, liberal groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council
(NRDC) were not described as liberal.
<P>
Stephen Barr's story on the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) read like a bureaucrat's newsletter,
beginning with the headline "Cuts Frustrate OSHA Plans to Improve
Worker Safety." Barr mourned the agency's 15 percent budget
reduction and trotted out the OSHA line that it has far too few
inspectors to enforce its regulations in every business across the
nation. Barr passed on OSHA complaints that it hasn't enough money
for its office redesign plans and computer networking operations.
Barr added that its employees "likely will lose part of their
salaries through unpaid furlough days....The possibility of layoffs
has flattened morale at OSHA and left many OSHA employees feeling
anxious about their futures." 
<P>
Barr didn't address the philosophical point of new congressional
oversight -- that for decades, regulatory agencies had no check or
balance in the legislative branch -- or the obvious counterpoint
that OSHA's actions have often caused economic frustrations and
anxieties to businesses.
<P>
In the last article of the series, reporter Gary Lee mourned the
failure to implement new revisions from the 1990 Clean Air Act
reauthorization. As David Hawkins of the NRDC complained in the
series' last paragraph: "We'll never be able to get clean air in
areas like [Baltimore or Houston] without stricter enforcement of
the act." Apparently to the Post, "deregulation" doesn't mean the
repeal of regulations, but merely slowing down the juggernaut of
ever-increasing government interference.

<P>
What a difference the message makes. After 60 Minutes last fall
spiked part of an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, the ex-Brown &
Williamson cigarette company executive, CBS reporters were angry
and embarrassed that Wigand's confidentiality pledge prevented him
from blowing the whistle on his former employer. On February 4, CBS
overcame the legal hurdle and aired the spiked charges about
manipulated nicotine levels. On PBS's Charlie Rose February 6 Dan
Rather said that story "was gutsy, great reporting."
<P>
Fast forward a week and CBS correspondent Bernard Goldberg blew the
whistle on CBS, detailing in a February 13 Wall Street Journal
op-ed how colleague Eric Engberg's story on the flat tax "set new
standards for bias." Goldberg explained that "The old argument that
the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so
blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
<P>
So did journalists trumpet this whistle-blower? Hardly. "It's such
a wacky charge....I don't know what Bernie was driving at. It just
sounds bizarre," Face the Nation's Bob Schieffer told The
Washington Post. "To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd,"
sniffed CBS News President Andrew Heyward. "The test is not the
names people call you or accusations by political activists inside
or outside your own organization," Rather told the New York Post in
an insult to Goldberg's professionalism, insisting "I am not going
to be cowed by anybody's special political agenda."
<P>
USA Today's Peter Johnson reported March 11: "Some colleagues
supported him privately. But many others stopped talking to him,
dismissing him as dead wrong, an ingrate, a nut or all of the
above. Mostly, the big chill set in. Not-so-coincidentally, none of
his commentary segments on the News, `Bernard Goldberg's America,'
has aired since the day his piece came out."
<P>
Johnson concluded that CBS has decided to bully the messenger:
"Goldberg has spent the past month lying low, hoping animus toward
him would die down. It hasn't, and all signs around CBS News are
that it will continue until Goldberg shows interest in eating a
healthy serving of humble pie." 
<P>
The March 13 New York Post reported that Goldberg apologized to
Engberg and is sorry if he "hurt anyone's feelings." But Goldberg
felt he had to go public since, as he explained to the Post's Josef
Adalian, he "tried for years and years to discuss this issue," but
was "met with varying degrees of `Who cares?'"

Two network veterans have joined the effort to re-elect President 
Clinton. In the Clinton-Gore campaign office, Roll Call reported that 
Joseph Lockhart, who bounces between Democratic presidential campaigns 
and network slots, has bounced again, this time into the national press 
secretary slot. Lockhart was an assistant press secretary to Democratic 
candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, then Press Secretary to Senator Paul 
Simon until becoming assignment editor for ABC News in Chicago in 1985. 
He put in a stint as a deputy assignment editor at CNN before joining 
the 1988 Dukakis-Bentsen campaign as a traveling press aide.
Stuart Schear, the off-air health and science reporter until last year 
for the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, has joined the White House press office 
as coordinator of local and national TV interviews with the President, 
The Washington Post reported. For the July/August 1995 Mother Jones, 
Schear wrote "a consumer guide to the health insurer's new, overheated 
advertising campaigns."

ABC and Fox have chosen political operatives to head their future 
all-news cable channels. ABC News President Roone Arledge went left, 
hiring back former ABC News executive Jeff Gralnick from NBC News where 
he's been Executive Producer of the NBC Nightly News since 1993. In 1971 
Gralnick served as Press Secretary to liberal Senator George McGovern 
(D-S.D.). After promoting the future presidential candidate, Gralnick 
jumped to ABC, where by 1979 he had risen to Executive Producer of World 
News Tonight. He oversaw all election coverage for ABC since 1980, 
becoming Vice President and Executive Producer of special events in 
1985.
<P>
Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch went to the right, naming Roger Ailes, 
President of CNBC since 1993, as the chief executive of the Fox All News 
Network as well as of the Fox broadcast news operation. While  producer 
of the Mike Douglas Show in the 1960s, Ailes met Richard Nixon and left 
the show to become media adviser to the 1968 Republican candidate's 
successful run. He spent the next two decades devising media and ad 
strategies for GOP candidates, including Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
In 1992 he took the helm of the Rush Limbaugh TV show as its Executive 
Producer.

Six media veterans are making out pretty well at the White House, a June

of salaries of 407 White House staffers released by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service 
and general government.
<P>
The list shows that speechwriting head Donald Baer, a former U.S. News 
Assistant Managing Editor, earns $125,000 a year. Wall Street Journal 
and Time reporter turned speechwriter Daniel Benjamin gets $80,000, as 
do speechwriters Carolyn Curiel, a former Nightline producer, and Alison 
Muscatine, a former Washington Post reporter who also helped write First 
Lady Hillary Clinton's book It Takes a Village. Deputy Press Secretary 
Virginia Terzano, a CBS News election unit researcher in 1988, pulls 
down $66,000. At the bottom end lies Anne Edwards at $50,000, a former

Lard on the Labels, Investigate Finances, and Charge Bigotry<BR>

Reporters don't like ideological labeling, at least when it's
applied to them. Last November, Dan Rather told Denver radio host
Mike Rosen he hated "to be tagged by someone else's label. I try
really hard not to do that with other people, particularly people
who are in public service and politics."
<P>
So do reporters use labeling in campaign coverage? MediaWatch
analysts compared media coverage of the primaries in 1992 with
those in 1996. Analysts reviewed evening news coverage of the four
networks (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's The World Today and in 1992 World News or Prime
News) for 19 days, starting with the Tuesday before the New
Hampshire primary.
<P>
For 1992, the days studied were February 11-29; in 1996, February
13-March 2, the day of the South Carolina primary. Both were 
periods when voters and reporters winnowed down the presidential
field.
<P>
The study found the Democratic candidates or their supporters were
labeled "liberal" only four times, none suggesting extremism. In
1996, GOP candidates or their supporters were labeled 73 times, 45
of the labels suggesting extremism. Analysts also looked at
campaign controveries. Five stories investigated the finances of
Republicans, compared to no investigations of the Democrats.
Charges of bigotry by  Pat Buchanan were featured in 20 stories.  
<P>
<a name=labels>
<H3>Labels.</H3>
<P>
Reporters used only four liberal labels to describe the Democratic
candidates, all in the first two days of the 1992 study period. On
February 11, NBC's Andrea Mitchell used two labels, calling Tom
Harkin "a pure liberal and proud of it" with "old-fashioned liberal
solutions." That same night, ABC's Judy Muller noted: "If Kerrey's
health plan strikes some voters as too liberal, his more
conservative proposals for dealing with the recession seem to
strike a chord with voters trying to make ends meet." The next
night, Muller said Harkin calls himself "an unabashed liberal." 
<P>
Even when the ideology seemed obvious, reporters stressed
candidates were not liberal, but part of the mainstream. On
February 12, 1992, ABC reporter Chris Bury reported on Jerry Brown:
"To those who hear him, Brown's appeal is his idealism, his calls
for political reform, universal health care, and environmental
activism." Despite that left-wing agenda, Bury underlined: "Some
voters seemed surprised Brown did not sound so radical." The
closest thing to a Clinton label came from ABC's Jack Smith, who
told viewers a week later that Clinton's economic message "runs
counter to so much traditional liberal ideology." (Did reporters
eschew labeling in 1992? No. Stories during the study period on the
1992 GOP race used the word "conservative" or "from the right" on
77 occasions, with four references to extremism.) 
<P>
In 1996, Republicans and their voters were labeled on 73 occasions.
The networks employed 18 conservative descriptions, six moderate
labels, and even four liberal tags (all of them from  reporters
quoting Buchanan's attacks on his rivals). On the 18th, NBC's David
Bloom said Lamar Alexander was "trying to bolster his conservative
credentials." But extreme terms were applied on 45 occasions -- all
but one to describe Pat Buchanan. (The exception: Bloom called 
Alexander a "moderate Republican with a radical plan of
devolution.") Among references to extremism, 36 used the terms
"extreme" or "extremist," but analysts included the terms
"ultraconservative," "too conservative" or "out of the mainstream."
<P>
CBS led the networks with 19 references to Buchanan's extremism
(compared to 12 for CNN, nine for ABC, and five by NBC). On six
occasions, CBS underlined their perception of Buchanan's
ultraconservatism by referring to the networks' Voter News Service
exit poll question asking if Buchanan was too extreme. In a
February 18 interview with Sen. Phil Gramm, Dan Rather asked:
"There is a perception that Buchanan has around him people with
extremist views on race. Do you agree?" On February 25, CBS weekend
anchor John Roberts asked CBS consultant Joe Klein: "Some call
Buchanan an extremist. Others call him as American as apple pie.
What is this fellow's appeal?" Klein replied: "He is both. He is an
extremist and as American as apple pie." 
<P>
<a name=finances>
<H3>Finances.</H3>
<P>
Reporters were not interested in the Democratic candidates'
finances in 1992, airing no stories during the study period. When
Whitewater first came to light on March 8, 1992, NBC aired only one
story, eight days later. CBS made a brief mention on the 8th, and
then dismissed financial questions on the 16th. Reporter Richard
Threlkeld portrayed Whitewater questions as an invasion of Hillary
Clinton's privacy.  All together, the networks did just five full
stories on the Clinton finances in 1992.
<P>
In 1996, CBS and NBC combined for five stories in just 19 days
touching on Republican candidate finances. NBC investigated the
sweetheart deals of Lamar Alexander on February 13, and mentioned
them again February 18. CBS investigated the Alexander deals on
February 15, then added another look at Honey Alexander's and
Elizabeth Dole's financial moves on February 17. On March 2, CBS
suggested hypocrisy in Buchanan's stock ownership of Fortune 500
corporations. On February 21, CBS reporter Rita Braver claimed
Lamar Alexander had "some financial dealings in his past that might
put Whitewater to shame."
<P>
<a name=bigotry>
<H3>Bigotry?</H3>
<P>
Sparked by the disclosure that Buchanan campaign co-chair Larry
Pratt spoke at forums shared by white supremacists, the networks
aired twenty stories raising the allegation that Buchanan was
bigoted against blacks or Jews. CBS reporter Phil Jones concluded:
"Buchanan has been talking and writing like this for years. Then,
he was on the fringe. Now, he's on the front line and Americans are
starting to take a closer look at Pat Buchanan's America." The
story count didn't include isolated soundbites, like one voter on
the March 2 CBS Evening News: "Buchanan scares me. He reminds me of
a little guy over in Germany with a mustache." 
<P>
In September 1992, Bill Clinton claimed: "Nobody's had a tougher
press than I have. No candidate in history has." Some of this
year's candidates may beg to differ.

<Center><h2>
Bright Side for April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>


<b>Detecting Deception</b><br>

CNN's Brooks Jackson was first out of the gate to critique the presidential candidates in their ads and speeches. On the April 1 Inside Politics he critiqued Republican charges that Clinton judges were soft on crime. But in a surprising turn Jackson has also slammed Clinton's newest set of ads. His April 4 "Spin Patrol" segment challenged each claim made in the Democratic National Committee ads.
<p>
CNN aired the ad: "The President proposes a balanced budget protecting Medicare, education, the environment. But Dole is voting no. The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans. Dole votes no." 
<p>
Jackson replied: "Dole voting no to a balanced budget and tax cuts? Let's see that again...True, Clinton's latest budget would balance in 7 years on paper, but experts are skeptical." Jackson used moderate-to-liberal Carol Cox Wait of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution.
<p>
Jackson found the ad's claim "The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans" was "Not the whole story." He pointed out that the Clinton administration arrived at the 40 million number through the 1993 budget bill's expansion of the earned income tax credit to "15 million low wage families, 40 million if you count their children." Jackson countered they also raised taxes on 1.5 million high-income families and 5 million Social Security recipients, not to mention higher gas taxes for everyone.
<p>
Another ad claimed Republicans cut school lunches. Jackson: "Not so. The Republican Congress appropriated more money for school lunches this year....And the Agriculture Department says it has increased the number of children served." 
<p>
The same ad charged the GOP cut Head Start: "Money for the Head Start pre-school program has been cut four percent this year, temporarily. But Republican leaders have agreed to a one percent increase once a permanent appropriations bill is passed. Meanwhile not a single child has been affected. In fact Head Start enrollment is up this year."  
<p>
And the DNC's claim that Republicans "cut child health care" did not go unchallenged. Jackson explained that Republicans only reduced the rate of Medicaid growth and that there is not much difference between the GOP and Clinton's proposal.

<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award for the April 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>

<b>
CBS, NBC Suggest "Extremist" Bishop Guilty of "Witch Hunt" for Upholding Church Teaching.
</b><br>
In the sophisticated ambiance of TV newsrooms, freedom of association is a concept apparently as outmoded as traditional religion. The notion that in America, a church is a voluntary association, bound together by commonly held theological beliefs, is a strange and alien argument. For holding up a Catholic bishop as a symbol of "extremism" enforcing a "blacklist," CBS and NBC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
On the March 25 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began: "In Lincoln, Nebraska, a bishop is taking the Catholic Church's battle over personal morality a step further. He is threatening to excommunicate any parishioner who joins groups advocating positions the church opposes. That threat puts this bishop in the forefront of a national furor, as we hear from Scott Pelley."
<p>
Pelley began: "Critics call him an extremist, a danger to the Catholic Church. What has thrust national notoriety upon Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz is a list, his own blacklist of organizations, he says, threaten the mortal soul...Bruskewitz has decreed that parishioners in his diocese of southern Nebraska have seven weeks to resign memberships in the listed groups, or be excommunicated, severing, the bishop says, their relationship with God."
<p>
He added: "The list includes pro-choice Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, which advocates a right to die. But it also includes some organizations that consider themselves to be Catholic, even though they stray from Vatican teaching. One of them, known as Call to Action, advocates the ordination of women."
<p>
Call to Action's Robert McClory claimed: "The organization was founded to promote dialogue on issues, about which Catholics are seriously divided. He would prefer, evidently, that there be no discussion, and he's ordered those people, who think so, to simply get out of his house." Pelley noted: "The Bruskewitz list may be unique in America. Bishops rule their own diocese; parishioners are welcome to appeal to the Pope. Randall Moody faces excommunication. He is a parishioner and a member of Planned Parenthood's [national] board of directors." Moody oozed: "The organizations affected by this excommunication order are mainstream America, and it paints the church into the corner of being an extremist organization."
<p>
Pelley allowed Bruskewitz to speak: "These groups mislead people into thinking that they're compatible with the Catholic religion when they're not....It's not a question of not wanting to discuss issues. It's a question of an organization, which is, by its very constitution, inimical to the Catholic faith, which is destructive of church discipline."
<p>
Pelley ended: "The controversy is an example of tension in the American church, with a conservative Vatican on one side and reform-minded Catholics on the other. Now in Nebraska, there is a deadline for those who must decide whether they live their conscience or keep their faith."
<p>
NBC Nightly News had a similar take on April 1. While the on-screen graphic read "Blacklisted," Tom Brokaw pronounced: "A controversy is splitting apart a church as it prepares to enter its holiest week. At issue: A threat by a Catholic bishop in Nebraska to expel members from the church, for reasons his critics say belong in another era. Here's NBC's Linda Vester."
<p>
Vester began: "Last night in Lincoln, more than 60 Catholics gathered to figure out how to avoid being kicked out of their church...They're angry with the bishop of Lincoln for threatening them with the ultimate punishment: excommunication. Their crime: belonging to any of twelve groups the bishop has blacklisted, including Planned Parenthood, the Freemasons, and Call to Action, a nationwide organization that advocates women priests, married priests, and birth control."
<p>
Bruskewitz said: "Membership in these organizations that are listed certainly imperils the Catholic faith." Vester countered: "But a blanket order of excommunication, for any reason, is rare, unheard of in modern times. Some members of Call to Action, like Rosalyn Carr, are afraid and are quitting the group." Carr charged: "Well, I think the bishop has ways to retaliate."
<p>
Vester added: "But at Call to Action's meeting last night, others were defiant. Those who defy the bishop's order will be excommunicated May 15, which means they can attend mass, but they can't take communion or get  married in the church. The bishop says he won't enforce the order; he expects people to police themselves....But the bishop is getting help. The pro-life group, Rescue America, is going to give him members' names from the local Planned Parenthood."
<p>
Vester asked: "Is it a witch hunt? One theologian thinks it may turn people away from a church already struggling with its image." Father Richard McBride of the University of Notre Dame exclaimed: "It reinforces the prejudice that a lot of people have that it really is a new, a modern form of authoritarianism."
<p>
Vester wrapped it up: "Despite what critics say, Bishop Bruskewitz insists his order stands." Bruskewitz said: "Oh, I have no intentions of waffling." Vester's conclusion was almost identical to Pelley's: "Which leaves some Catholics here feeling forced to choose between their conscience and their church." When contacted by MediaWatch, both reporters were said to be on assignment. Despite numerous calls and faxes, neither responded.
<p>
William Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, told MediaWatch the networks are guilty of "rank hypocrisy" in their coverage of freedom of association: "The American Civil Liberties Union has a policy that every officer is pro-choice. If an officer were to evolve into a pro-life position, he would become a pariah, like Nat Hentoff, who was thrown off the board of directors. That's their prerogative. But where's the charge of authoritarianism?"
<p>
Donohue said the same is true for reporters: "I asked a newspaper reporter: what if one of your colleagues went on the local TV station and denounced your newspaper? If a secular organization won't tolerate that kind of insubordination, why is the Church held to a different standard?" This is especially pertinent in the case of CBS News after reporter Bernard Goldberg was kept off the air for months after he denounced the liberal bias of his own network. A CBS statement said Rather "disagrees with Mr. Goldberg's opinion...and its expression." 
<p>
Perhaps the networks' blind spot is unique to religion, where they imply that dissent is noble and church doctrine autocratic, that theology is subject to a vote and salvation is accomplished by focus group. CBS and NBC had three possible ways to present its story: Bruskewitz as hero for standing up for tradition, Bruskewitz as author-itarian villain, or a balanced presentation of both views. Instead of pursuing the professional third option, they opted for the bishop as villain.

<center><h2>
Newsbites for the April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>
<p>

<b>First Pitch Glitch</b><br>

NBC's Tom Brokaw swung and missed when he tried to cover for the President. During the traditional first pitch thrown by the President on baseball's Opening Day, Bill Clinton was roundly booed by many in attendance at the April 2 Orioles game. Brokaw delivered the play-by-play:
<p>
"President Clinton taking the mound for the ceremonial first pitch. All the way from the pitcher's rubber, it was a little on the high side, and watching from the stands and not booing like most of the rest of the crowd -- Pat Buchanan. By the way the boos, like the first pitch, are traditional whoever the President.
<p>
Dan Rather didn't even mention the boos on the same night's CBS Evening News. Viewers only heard cheering at Clinton's lob. But on that day's CNN Inside Politics Bruce Morton replayed five recent Opening Day first pitches, one from Ronald Reagan, three from George Bush, and a previous Clinton throw. In all five, including Clinton's earlier pitch, the President was cheered.
<p>

<b>The Nadir of Coverage</b><br>

GOP presidential candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm were not only labeled as conservative but as "hard right," "extreme," and "hard-line." Then it would only make sense that someone to the left of Bill Clinton would be considered, at the very least, a liberal. But in the midst of Ralph Nader's campaign for President on the Green Party ballot, reporters referred to the outspoken leftist as not "hard left" or "far left" but as merely a "consumer advocate" or "consumer activist."
<p>
Since the media started paying attention to the Nader candidacy, reporters have failed to mention liberal in the same sentence as Nader. NBC's Gwen Ifill referred to him as "the consumer activist" on the March 24 Nightly News. On The World Today the same night, CNN's Martin Savidge reported: "Consumer advocate Ralph Nader says he'll be on California's presidential ballot this fall." In a search of Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and USA Today, only U.S. News mentioned the "L" word: the March 25 issue called Nader a "liberal alternative to Clinton." 
<p>

<b>What's "Risky and Radical"?</b><br> 

On the March 12 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather warned of coming Social Security reform proposals: "The stock market could play a big role in major changes in Social Security. A bipartisan commission is due out soon to officially propose some radical changes in the whole Social Security system that would include privatizing Social Security, allowing some of your Social Security contributions to be invested in the stock market. Now, this may or may not prove to be a good idea, but it could be risky business." 
<p>
CBS reporter Bob Schieffer, who also called the plan "radical change," stated on the March 26 CBS This Morning that "even more radical, [is] a plan favored by some commission members to allow taxpayers to invest, any way they want, almost half of what they now pay in Social Security taxes." How does the media's take on Social Security reform stack up against other large-scale changes proposed in Washington? 
<p>
Database searches reveal that not once did a network reporter refer to the Clinton health care plan as "radical." The plan Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner cooked up amounted to a government take-over of one-seventh of the economy. That's not radical -- but allowing people to invest their own retirement money is.

Cartooning Contrasts.
</b><br>
During this year's Lenten season, when Christians examine their faith and commitment to God, the Los Angeles Times decided to show its own hostility to religion. In the March 28 issue the paper ran an editorial cartoon with the image of Bob Dole crucified. The crown of thorns on his forehead read "Christian Coalition."
<p>
Three days later, the paper spiked Johnny Hart's Palm Sunday B.C. comic strip, featuring the character Wiley writing a poem honoring Christ's death for man's sins. Los Angeles Times spokeswoman Ariel Remler told The Washington Times that "lately he's [Hart] been running cartoons with religious overtones." Then in an April 2 statement quoted in The Washington Times, Remler announced that the paper would spike the strip on all three days of the Easter weekend. After receiving hundreds of protest calls, the paper reversed itself, announcing it would run the Friday and Saturday strips.
<p>
Two years ago, the Times played a similar game, spiking Hart's "inappropriate" Easter Sunday strip with a resurrection theme, but then ran in June a series of Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury strips featuring John Boswell's controversial claim that the Catholic Church sanctioned same-sex marriages in the middle ages.

<b>
No Liberal Lobbies.
</b><br>
In March, the House of Representatives voted on repealing the assault weapons ban and outlawing partial-birth abortion. But the media found a narrow "lobby" on only one side of these issues. During the gun debate in late March, the networks employed the term "gun lobby" over six times on the morning and evening news to denote those who opposed the ban. Most happened on CBS, like the March 21 CBS Evening News piece where Bob Schieffer announced: "With Republicans knowing they lack the votes to override a veto and with little enthusiasm for any of this in the Senate, the House effort may turn out to be little more than a publicity stunt to impress the gun lobby."
<p>
In the liberal lexicon of Washington, an industry is termed a "lobby" when it pushes narrow interest for its own gain. But those who opposed the partial birth abortion ban were pushing a narrow, extreme interest to satisfy their own backers. Yet not once during the congressional wrangling over partial birth abortions did anyone on the networks use the term "abortion lobby." 
<p>
<b>
Gender Chasm!
</b><br>
Like they do every presidential election year, reporters are raising the so-called gender gap, claiming that Republicans have problems attracting women. On the March 25 NBC Nightly News, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming stated: "Polls show a huge gender gap brewing. Women, like these we gathered, are more upset than men by budget cuts and family issues that they feel are being ignored." So do Democrats have a problem attracting men? Yes, but this didn't interest ABC and NBC.
<p>
On Good Morning America Sunday March 24, ABC's Jack Smith recalled the budget fight: "Where men saw deficit reduction, women worried about what the cuts were doing." In the ensuing discussion, co-host Willow Bay asserted: "If you're still making 70 cents to that male dollar, you're probably more reluctant to see cuts in social spending -- your safety net."
<p>
While some attributed the gap to social spending, others cited the GOP's pro-life stance. NBC's Lisa Myers began her report on the March 5 Nightly News: "Republicans have a problem with women....And today, polls show women leaning even more heavily in favor of Democrats. The big reason: Pat Buchanan." Myers spoke to Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and stated: "Snowe says even though Buchanan won't be the nominee, his polarizing anti-abortion rhetoric has done lasting damage." Myers concluded that Clinton's lead over Dole with women is "not a gender gap, [it's] a chasm."
<p>
If reporters believe the gap is due to abortion, they need to examine the polls. A May 1995 Tarrance Group poll found that 47 percent of women (compared to 44 percent of men) believe that abortion should be "illegal and prohibited under all circumstances" or "illegal except in cases such as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother."
<p>
<b>
Green Gary
</b><br>
Guilt by association is still a handy media tool. The March 21 Washington Post headline read: "Industry Funds Global Warming Skeptics." Reporter Gary Lee began: "A Washington environmental group charged yesterday that three researchers who are outspoken critics of the scientific evidence for global warming have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the petroleum and coal industries, and that this funding has influenced their views."
<p>
Lee described his source, Ozone Action, only as "an environmental group that lobbies on the issues of air quality and global climate change." Lee didn't use the word liberal or note they've even criticized Vice President Gore for being too soft on the environment. While Lee did call the researchers for comment, and quoted Patrick Michaels calling the charges "ludicrous," Lee excluded one obvious point: liberal environmental groups also take in hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil companies. The Capital Research Center noted that Exxon gave the National Audubon Society $112,500 in 1991 alone. The Post didn't do that man-pays-for-dog-to-bite-him story.
<p>

<b>Gannett Fires Like America.
</b><br>
The Gannett-owned Burlington [Vt.] Free Press fired Paul Teetor for reporting a story accurately, another victim of political correctness. But now he's been vindicated. In August 1993, Teetor angered black activists by reporting that a white woman was escorted from a community forum on racism after she tried to address it. A black city official, Rodney Patterson, told her the microphone they had set up for comments was for people "of color" only, not whites. After the story appeared, black activists demanded Teetor be fired for publishing an inaccurate story, even though a videotape confirmed Teetor's account. The Free Press canned him and ran a piece whitewashing Teetor's account of the meeting in accordance with the activists' demand.
<p>
Teetor filed a lawsuit against the paper. According to the March 29 Washington Post, the paper settled in his favor for an undisclosed sum. At trial, Teetor's lawyer alleged the real reason for the firing was the Gannett chain's "All-American Contest" where papers are evaluated and scored on how many minorities the paper hires and how positively minorities are depicted in news stories. Free Press editors were worried how the town meeting story would affect their scores because the contest results could be a factor in their own job promotions. 
<p>

<b>Fighting Forbes
</b><br>
The day before Steve Forbes ended his presidential bid, CBS reporter Phil Jones declared on the Evening News: "He struck fear in the hearts of his opponents by launching what may turn out to be the most massive, negative TV attack campaign in the history of American politics." Jones failed to mention the role CBS played in promoting negative politics. The network provided opponents with a free negative ad when it ran Eric Engberg's February 8 hit piece on the Forbes flat tax. Engberg referred to Forbes' "number one wackiest flat tax pro- mise." No wonder the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that with 87 percent derogatory comments, Engberg was the most negative reporter during the primaries.
<p>
<b>
Goldberg Survives, for Now. 
</b><br>

Speaking of Eric Engberg, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg returned to the air April 9 with an Evening News "Eye on America" segment on rising youth crime caused by a deficit of values. Goldberg had been off the air since his February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing Engberg's story "set new standards for bias" and the liberal bias charge is "blatantly true."
<p>
The CBS Evening News had been airing "Bernard Goldberg's America," but CBS News President Andrew Heyward dumped the feature and has assigned him to the "Eye on America" beat. Goldberg's eight-week shunning and loss of his signature piece, however, may not be his only punishments. The Washington Post's John Carmody reported March 22: "Heyward would not comment on Goldberg's future when his contract expires at the end of the year." So much for promoting free speech.

Media Tied Talk Radio, Conservatives and Gingrich to Oklahoma City, But the Unabomber's On His Own
</b><br>
After the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing the media hurled charges of complicity at conservatives. Referring to Newt Gingrich's language, Time declared that the "burden of fostering the delusion" that government is the enemy "is borne not just by the nut cases who preach conspiracy but also to some extent by those who erode faith in governance in the pursuit of their own ambitions." Asked Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation: "There's been a lot of anti-government rhetoric, it comes over talk radio...Do you think that that somehow has led these people to commit this act?" 
<p>
But this April, even after ABC detailed the Unabomber's left-wing ties, the rest of the media failed to pick up the theme.  
<P>
Two days after suspect Ted Kaczynski's April 3 arrest, Brian Ross reported on World News Tonight that his "name appeared...in connection with an FBI investigation of a radical environmental group called Earth First...Over the years, Earth First has been best known as a violent group spiking trees and blowing up logging equipment, and in many respects its anti-corporate philosophy parallels that of the Unabomber." 
<P>
Ross noted "that authorities believe Kaczynski was at a meeting attended by top Earth First members." A private investigator, Ross relayed, "says the bomb last year that killed the head of the California Forestry Association clearly can be tracked back to a hit list published in one radical environmental journal."
Instead of being consistent,  reporters buried the tie. On April 8 the environmental angle made it into the 35th paragraph of a USA Today story as well as the 15th paragraph in The New York Times that day and The Washington Post the next. Insisting "there is no proof," NBC's David Bloom dismissed the link April 10.
<P>
The Unabomber manifesto rails against capitalism (it begins "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race"), but the April 15 Time noted no one recalled him having contact at Berkeley "with the leftists he would later excoriate in his manifesto." 
<P>
Some were sympathetic. USA Today's April 11 front page read: "UNABOMBER: A Hero to Some." Richard Price reported he's "being romanticized for his intellect" as "some people even feel sorry for him, seeing him a brilliant boy gone astray." On C-SPAN's Sunday Journal April 7, Time's Elaine Shannon found parts of the manifesto she agreed with, such as, "industrialization and pollution are all terrible things." She reasoned: "He wasn't a hypocrite, he lived as he wrote." Kaczynski "carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike, he didn't have any plumbing."

Rotten in Denmark?
</b><br>
The media have often promoted liberal claims about the dangers of "overpopulation." Now that a new book, Our Stolen Future (with an introduction by Al Gore) theorizes that man-made chemicals are responsible for impending sterility, the media reaction is the same: unquestioned acceptance of ominous liberal claims. 
<P>
Time science writer Michael Lemonick wrote March 18 that "In study after study, sperm counts in men the world over seem to be dropping precipitously." He claimed the book contains "powerful evidence" to support the hypothesis that "reproduction-related ills may be caused by chemical pollutants in the environment, including DDT." The book is based on data from a Danish scientist, Niels Skakkebaek, whose meta-analysis of 61 sperm count studies found a 50 percent decline since 1938.
<P>
Though Lemonick wrote "the evidence for a chemical-infertility link does remain largely circumstantial," he warned of apocalypse: "Extrapolating from Skakkebaek's admittedly controversial data, it's conceivable that the average man will be infertile within a century. Even if things are only half that dire, it would be bad news indeed for the human race."
<P>
<i>Today's</i> Bryant Gumbel used the same tone with book cowriter Theo Colborn on March 12: "The extinction of the human race has long been a staple of science fiction, but according to a group of scientists, it could one day prove to be all too true, and they say the cause of the problem may be man-made chemicals." 
In a letter to Today, Dr. Glenn Swogger of the American Council on Science and Health claimed Colborn's "claims of lower sperm counts relates to a subsequently discredited study a number of years ago and is stale news in the scientific community...We run the risk of so limiting pesticide use through excessive regulation and discouragement of research that we will lose the valuable contribution they make to producing cheap and healthy fruits and vegetables." Gumbel only mentioned the ACSH to note they're "partially funded...by industry."
<P>
Robert Hager provided a more sober account on the April 1 NBC Nightly News, noting critics claimed the book was "bad science." Journalist Ronald Bailey was then allowed to critique the book's science in NBC's "In Their Own Words" segment.

<b>Bryant Gumbel, a Conservative? 
</b>
<br>
The March 21 Radio & TV Correspondents Dinner drew a lot of pressattention to the remarks of talk show host Don Imus, but the betterstory came from Marc Morano, Rush Limbaugh's man in D.C. He asked reporters in attendance about liberal bias, and the reporters only demonstrated their liberalism. 
<P>
Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite admitted: "Everybody knows that there's a liberal, that there's a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." Cronkite argued, however, this is justified:"Anybody who has to live with the people, who covers police stations, covers county courts, brought up that way, has to have a degree of humanity that people who do not have that exposure don't have, and some people interpret that to be liberal. It's not a liberal, it's humanitarian and that's a vastly different thing."
<P>
When asked about the new Whitewater book, Blood Sport by JamesStewart, ABC's John Cochran felt the book was beneath him: "I haven't read it. I'm just now going through Elizabeth Drew's book,which is about the battle between the Gingrich Congress and theClinton White House and it's fascinating. It has nothing to do with gossip or Whitewater or what happened with Vince Foster or any ofthat, it has to do with what's happening with issues of importance to the American people." CBS's Bill Plante felt the issue was a waste of time: "The problem with the media coverage of Whitewater is that it has been done over and over and over again. I haven't read the book yet, but I understand that there's nothing basically new in it."
<P>
CNN's Judy Woodruff retorted to a query about Bernard Goldberg's comments about liberal bias: "I think Mr. Goldberg went a little bit too far...I don't think there's any blatant, rampant bias in the news media. If there were, then we wouldn't last in the jobs that we have." Most incredibly, Today weatherman Al Roker claimed:"I don't think there's a liberal bias in the media. Let me put it this way, I've never worked with a liberal anchorman, they're all very conservative." This from the man who shares a studio with Bryant Gumbel.

Revolving Door for the April 1996 Mediawatch.

<P>
<b>Oklahoma Bill's Hate Radio</b><br>

After a year away to deal with heart trouble, Bill Moyers, a former Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, returned to NBC on April 12 to host a Dateline NBC special "Oklahoma City: One Year Later." The day of the show, the New York Post quoted Moyers as insisting that he went to Oklahoma City "with nothing but a desire to find out what was happening. There was no agenda."
<P>
In reality, Moyers implied conservative rhetoric led to the bombing. But instead of having the integrity to name names or cite statements, Moyers offered an hour filled with vague generalities which held culpable "hate radio" and "the rhetoric of politics this season." Dateline featured this exchange with service station owner Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed:
<P>
Welch: "I thought, the first few months, that there was probably going to be more unity in the country, politically."
Moyers: "That this tragedy would bring us together?"
Welch: "Yes, that this tragedy would bring it together, but we're seeing through the elections that's going on right now, the same negative thoughts, the militia groups, the hate radio."
Moyers: "And you think that contributed to the tragedy, the bombing here?"
Welch: "Absolutely, without a doubt. Because it justifies a lot of the angry feelings that people have."
<P>
As Welch listened to G. Gordon Liddy on his car radio, Moyers charged: "The airwaves are still saturated with militant rhetoric. Day and night you can hear a stream of rage and insult directed with unremitting hostility at government and others. It rubs like salt in deep wounds and some of the families are trying to counter it."  
<P>
Then, as viewers saw several victims being interviewed by KTOK's Carole Arnold, Moyers explained: "Emerging from their private grief, they appeal for an end of hateful talk and political invective. Their experience is their message. What a society sows, it reaps....This local station has given the families a forum, but it also carries several hours of talk every day that they find inflammatory." The station does not carry Liddy, so the broadside against "hate" and "inflammatory" talk goes undefined. Welch proceded to tell Arnold: "Of course I think the media need to be involved a little bit in a little bit of control of the hate radio going on. I'm very disturbed about that. I mean where's the responsibility?"
<P>
Having impugned talk radio, Moyers turned to the government shutdown: "Just as federal workers were coming out of shock from the bombing, there was another blow, this time from Washington." He asked a HUD supervisor who survived the blast: "It's been a tough year for you federal workers here. The bombing, the furlough, you lost pay for a while. You continue to be demonized in the rhetoric of politics this season. What does that do to your idea of yourself?"
<P>
Finally, Moyers concluded the hour with this seeming indictment of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as co-conspirator: "It will never be the same. The bombers saw to that. The tears and grief, the pain and the sorrow were all intended. Terrorism is the politics of murder. We should have seen it coming. Hate was in the air. Government had been vilified, found guilty and sentenced to die. It didn't matter who was in the way. There are lessons for us here, something to take away from the wreckage of that day, if we're listening, one year later."

Study for the April 1996 Mediawatch.

<P><b>
Network Religion Coverage Still Limited to Roughly One Percent of Total Coverage: Social Liberalism Rears Its Head on TV</b> 
<br>
In their survey The Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. The vast majority believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired Word of God. Sixty percent  can be found in houses of worship in a given month. This "silent majority" still worships under the radar screen of a secularized media elite.
<p>
The Media Research Center's first study of TV news coverage of religion in 1993 found a surprising paucity of  coverage and overt advocacy against traditional values: only 212 evening news stories and 197 morning show segments dealt with religion. Prime-time magazine and Sunday morning interview shows broached religion on only 18 occasions.  Religion coverage declined in 1994. Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments fell to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments dropped to nine. 
<P>
Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to religion, a slight increase (11 percent) from 1994.
  <p>
Despite more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1995. That's a one-third increase over 1994, but still less than one percent. 
<P>
The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on Sunday morning shows and prime-time magazines. Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live, and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly 400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994 to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also included three one-hour programs on religion, one on ABC and two on CBS. 
<P>
Institutions: The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up eight from 1994. Generic religion stories, often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations, came in second with 70 stories. News of Protestant denominations was again nearly absent.
<P>
The networks again portrayed the Catholic Church as an oppressive, narrow-minded, outmoded hierarchy. When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: "It's another example of the country's move to reinvent itself as a more modern and progressive Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently, there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run from government buildings and not the Vatican." 
<P>
Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning: "It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more tolerant place."
<P>
Abortion: Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142 stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
<P>
On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a decade." With coverage like that, reporter David Culhane could convey the results of a new poll during the January 8 CBS Evening News: "A new CBS poll shows that three out of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at several abortion clinics." 
<p>
What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, only CNN reported that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. In 1995, Daniel Adam Mahoney became the first pro-abortion activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school in Suffern, New York. But the networks were silent. 
<P>
While the networks devoted 142 stories to anti-abortion violence outside clinics, only three alluded to violence inside. CNN's September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated uterus during an abortion. Two 1995 segments aired estimates of 1.5 million abortions a year, two more mentions than in 1993 or 1994. 
<P>

Social Issues: The number of stories primarily about homosexuality increased from 105 in 1994 to 113 in 1995, still a fraction of the 1993 total of 756. But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again: in the few morning show interviews that aired, proponents of homosexuality outnumbered opponents, 13 to 3. 
Once again, the networks portrayed the religious right as a negative force in the Republican Party. While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or suggested they were less than Christian.
<P>
Dan Rather introduced a September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm "was at a meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling itself the Christian Coalition." Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather charged: "The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting Republicans elected."
