<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>W</strong></font>alter Pellett, who helped design more than half of the 1,169-mile interstate highway system in Arizona, still has fond memories of the historic era that started 40 years ago when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the interstate highway bill into law.<p>
"I particularly enjoyed the public hearings and the field inspections," said Pellett, who designed interstate highways first as a design squad leader then as assistant state engineer for design for 13 years.<p>
The interstate highway system, while the largest public works program in the world and an economic boon to the nation, faced controversy in rural communities because businessmen felt the proposed bypasses would cut off their economic lifeline.<p>
This led to some hotly debated location and design public hearings.<p>
"They felt we should go right through these little towns so we would go by all the motels," said Pellett, who retired in 1983 as assistant state engineer for local government projects.  "However, if we cut a 300-foot swath through the small towns we would have wiped out a lot of businesses and residents.  It also would have been cost prohibitive."<p>
Ultimately, the bypasses, which were built about a half-mile from the rural communities so motorists could still see the towns, were constructed last to soften the impact of the interstate highways, Pellett said.<p>
Another aspect of interstate design which Pellett enjoyed was establishing new alignments to replace circuitous state highways with straighter interstate highways.<p>
"When the design got to a certain point-about two-thirds done-we'd go out and inspect for proper grades, drainage and other particulars to make sure no problems were created in the design" said Pellett, now 78 and living in north Phoenix.<p>
"You went to a point and started hiking," he said.  "I'm sure I hiked at least 600 miles of the interstate system along with several other people."<p>
The district engineer and representatives from construction and right-of-way also were on the field inspections teams, Pellett said.<p>
A lot of hiking also was done by survey crews that set the initial alignments before design work started, Pellett said.<p>
"Those guys would be out for weeks at a time in the field camping out," he said.<p>
Field crews initially used topographic maps to set alignments, but later switched to the new technology of aerial photography.<p>
With much of his 32-year career dedicated to the interstate highway system, Pellett goes down as one of the forefathers of the system in Arizona.

Outpouring of concern and support<br> follow John Tucker&146;s untimely death
</H1></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>T</strong></font>he death of John Tucker while working for ADOT on the I-10 Maricopa Freeway produced the largest outpouring of concern and support for a fallen employee in more than 30 years.<p>
ADOT employees from throughout the state and from all parts of the Intermodal Transportation Division traveled to Phoenix to attend two memorial services for Tucker a few days after he was killed while painting a traffic signal at the 40th Street overpass.<p>
One service was held at a church in north Phoenix and was followed by a 200 truck procession down the Black Canyon Freeway to the State Capitol where officials from ADOT and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) presented plaques to the Tucker family.<p>
Eddie Newkirk, supervisor for the Mesa Maintenance ORG, requested the procession to call attention to the dangerous conditions under which ADOT personnel work.  He also helped organize the procession.<p>
Tucker, a steward for the ADOT Chapter of AFSCME, had touched a number of employees in his 10 years with the department.<p>
"He had a heck of a personality," said Bob Etheredge, Tucker's supervisor in Phoenix Signals and Lighting.  "He was very outgoing and outspoken.  He was always laughing."<p>
Etheredge also said Tucker was "a very cautious type person."<p>
"He had all the gear on at the time of the accident including the respirator, safety shoes, safety glasses, gloves and harness," he said.<p>
Tucker inadvertently moved the boom of his cherry picker over a lane adjacent to his truck.  He was struck by a tractor trailer and suffered massive injuries.  The truck driver was not cited.<p>
Tucker, 48, is survived by his fiancee, Cheryl Kelley, a daughter, a son, his father and two brothers.  Tucker was a native Arizonan and a Navy veteran.<p>

<a name="zone"><h1>
ADOT increasing measures <br>to ensure work zone safety
</h1></a>
<p>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>W</strong></font>ork zone safety was brought close to home when John Tucker, a traffic signal and lighting crew supervisor, was killed on August 20 when a tractor-trailer crashed into his cherry-picker basket while he was painting a traffic signal at the 40th Street overpass on I-10.<p>
However, the issue of work zone safety has been a priority for ADOT since early this year when the Executive Quality Council identified the issue as the top concern in the department and began taking steps to increase safety for the agency's field workers.<p>
Safety measures being taken by the department include increasing safety responsibilities among managers; modifying the way accident statistics are reported within the agency; developing legislation to increase fines for motorists who do not drive safely in work zones; working closer with law enforcement agencies on ticketing and other safety measures, and producing a television public service announcement for stations statewide. <p>
"There will be increased emphasis on talking about safety and safety awareness at the working level," said Mary Peters, ADOT's deputy director.  "We're holding every manager in this organization responsible for safety, beginning in this office.  Safety is everybody's responsibility, but managers have to take the lead in creating safety awareness."<p>
This, however, will not relieve ADOT workers for increasing their own safety awareness, said State Engineer Tom Schmitt.<p>
"With the best traffic control, there are still risks," Schmitt said.  "We have to take every precaution we can because life is too precious.  The key is awareness.  You have to be constantly aware.  We have to remember to move up the attenuator truck as the operation moves.  Everybody has to look out for everybody else. It just has to be the way we do our jobs."<p>
Peters added that ORG's will be encouraged to predict what accidents can occur in their work zones and to plan accordingly.  A pilot project along these lines in the Executive Quality Council showed promise, she said.<p>
"Accidents are predictable and preventable," Peters said.<p>
Closely related to increased awareness is a change in the way accident information will be reported at all levels within the department.<p>
Joe Puente, manager of the Safety Office, said his staff is working on a reporting system that will compare accidents among ADOT employees to national statistics for different occupations.  The reports will be sent down to the ORG'S.  These statistics have gone to the engineering districts and MVD regions in the past.<p>
The statistics also will be put in a new format so they are easier to read and understand, Puente said.<p>
Additionally, ADOT will begin using the Access program for reporting accidents within the department.  This means ORG's will be able to input information on accidents and get more timely reports for their safety meetings.<p>
"That's going to help us know if we have safety is Schmitt said.<p>
Another measure that will be taken to increase work zone safety is to introduce legislation in the next session of the Arizona Legislature to double fines for motorists convicted of speeding or other violations in work zones, Peters said.<p>
"Double fines would be a tool law enforcement could use to make the public conscious that traffic violations in work zones are not acceptable," she said.<p>
The measure will be supported by the Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement agencies, she noted.<p>
Law enforcement also wants to work closer with ADOT in cross training personnel and in positioning electronic signs in work zones to let motorists know how fast they are traveling, Peters said.<p>
However, the bottom line is individual commitment to work zone safety, Schmitt said.<p>
"No matter what the resources or the nature of the work, there's nothing out there that should preclude our employees from doing their work safely," he said.<p>

The driver whips around the corner and the car suddenly comes to a screeching halt as he notices the situation ahead.  A flagman warns the driver to slow down through the work zone for his safety and the safety of the crew working on the road.<p>
This is just one of the scenes in two TV public service announcements created by ADOT and the Governor's Office of Community and Highway Safety.  The PSA's will air on television stations statewide.<p>
The purpose of the commercials is to remind drivers to be more aware of workers on the road and respect traffic control that is set up on the roadway.  Drivers speeding through work zones and damage or theft of traffic control items are frequent problems that many ADOT workers are faced with on a regular basis.<p>
One commercial features legendary Indy driver Tom Sneva speeding around Phoenix International Raceway as he discusses the fact that he doesn't slow down for too many things.  Then, he approaches a work zone and the car slows to a crawl as he passes the ADOT workers.<p>
The second spot shows a group of teenagers stealing and destroying cones on the highway.  The teenagers celebrate their conquest until they realize that the cones have come to life to seek revenge.  One boy wakes up from the nightmare only to find his bed surrounded by cones.<p>

cool pines on the Mogollon Rim thanks to the early completion of a widening project on the 
Beeline Highway, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).
<P>An 11-mile stretch of the Beeline between McDowell Road and Shea Boulevard has 
been widened to a four-lane divided highway, cutting the travel time between Mesa and 
Fountain Hills about in half.  The trip can now be made in 15 to 20 minutes.
<P>The speed limit is 55 mph.
<P>Sundt Corp. of Tucson, which started the 
widening project in May, 1995, originally was not scheduled to complete the work until 
November.  Good construction weather and efficient work by the contractor, along with timely 
inspections by ADOT, led to the early completion in May.
<P>Sundt completed two new northbound lanes last November, just six months after they 
were started.  Two-way traffic was placed on the northbound lanes while the existing highway 
was reconstructed for the new southbound lanes.  This work was finished in five months.
<P>Planning for the $14.7 million McDowell to Shea project started in 1990 to relieve 
congestion and improve safety.  Following an initial study, the design work was completed in a 
&quot;very fast&quot; 11 months in 1994 by the consulting firm of Post, Buckley, Shuh and Jerigan.
<P>The State Transportation Board awarded the construction contract for the project in 
May, 1995.

McCauley spent eight years in construction in the Holbrook District before moving into materials testing in the Flagstaff District in 1990.  She returned to Holbrook two years later as the area lab supervisor and held that position until being named the Winslow Maintenance supervisor in 1994.<P>
McCauley, an all-business supervisor, said she gets lots of support from the 16 men who work for her.<p>
"They're good, personable guys," she said.  "They get along well.  They're a pretty good team.  They also treat me great.  They're very respectful.  They take real good care of me."<p>
Marcelo Vargas, a 27-year ADOT employee who has worked in Winslow Maintenance for 14 years, said McCauley is the best of three supervisors he has worked for.<p>
"She's real bright," Vargas said.  "For the time she's been in maintenance, she's picked up everything real quick."<p>
One thing that makes McCauley popular is the coffee can she keeps in her office with the names of all her employees.  McCauley pulls a name from the can whenever a special assignment-either good or bad-comes up.<p>
"That way I don't get accused of having a favorite." she said.  "It's kept arguments down.  It's worked really well."<p>
McCauley said she wishes she could do more for her employees, particularly in the way of higher wages.<p>
"They're not even half compensated for what we ask them to do,"  she said.  "They operate equipment that costs $160,000; they testify in court, including grueling depositions, when accidents occur; they work in hazardous situations, and they're stopped for all kinds of medical  emergencies."<p>
Concern for her employees and fair treatment are helping McCauley make her mark among maintenance supervisors.<p>

State employees get 100 percent bus subsidies</h2></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=4  color=#8b2252>Phoenix-</font></strong>State employees will be offered 100 percent bus subsidies through next March to help reduce carbon monoxide pollution in the Valley, according to a plan announced by Gov. Fife Symington on October 1.<p>
"We had phenominal success with bus subsidies during our ozone campaign and will continue to make a significant contribution by staying the course during the carbon monoxide season," said Symington, who first offered state employees the bus subsidies last May in an effort to reduce ozone problems.  "We hope citizens and businesses will join us in round two of this important fight."
<p>
By funding the incentive throught the winter months, Symington said the state will be able to tie in with next year's subsidy for the 1997 ozone season, and thus provide continuous support for state employees willing to leave their cars at home throught the end of next September.<p>
Symington said approximately 2,500 state employees rode the bus as part of Operation Ozone during the months of June, July and August, avoiding emissions of 4.4 tons of ozone-forming chemicals.<p>

Delay in Congress doesn&#146;t stop metric
</H2></a>
<P><font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</strong></font>Although Congress has delayed implementation of the metric system in state 
departments of transportation to the year 2000, ADOT is moving forward in designing and 
constructing highway projects in metric units.
<P>Thomas Buhr, ADOT's metric coordinator, said Congress is allowing states with 
metric programs to implement them while giving other state DOT's additional time to catch up.
<P>About 90 percent of the state DOT's are ready to use the metric system, he said.
ADOT employees will see a faster transition to metric, not only in the 
Intermodal Transportation Division, but also in the 
Administrative Services and Motor Vehicle Divisions.
<P>The department is working with the Associated General Contractors, Arizona 
Rock Products Association and Arizona Subcontractors Association to develop a training 
program this fall for field construction personnel.  
The training will be open to ADOT employees.
<P>Another key area in which ADOT is preparing for the metric system is in computer 
systems.  A major meeting was held in July to address all systems and to plan the conversions 
to metric.  The FAST system already accepts metric units, but other systems, likes TRACS 
and PECOS, have not yet been converted.
<P>MVD also is beginning to look at converting to metric, including the weighing of 
trucks through ports-of-entry.
<P> All documents for designing and constructing highways already have been converted 
to metric.  Early implementation in this area allowed ADOT to award its first metric project at 
the beginning of this year.  The project is a rock containment job on SR 89A in Oak Creek Canyon.

Your wish has been granted: now during non-rush hours all vehicles can use the carpool lanes on the Valley freeway system.  The signs with the new access hours were put along 70 miles of carpool lanes on I-10, I-17 and Loop 202 in September.<p>
The change was made in an effort to maximize the usage of the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes by allowing all traffic to use the lanes during off-peak times, while still encouraginging carpooling during the heavy volume rush hours.  The lanes will still be reserved for buses, motorcycles and vehicles with more than one passenger from 6 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday.<p>
The only area where the restrictions have not changed is the carpool lane on southbound I-17 between Beardsley Road and Peoria Avenue.  This section is still being evaluated based on safety concerns for traffic merging at the end of the carpool lane.<p>

<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Glendale-</strong></font> Arizona has two new officially-designated scenic highways to 
attract tourists to the visual wonders of Monument Valley, the Grand Canyon and the 
forest-covered Kaibab Plateau.
<P>The new scenic highways are the 23-mile Kayenta-Monument Valley Scenic Road 
(U.S. 163) in the northeast corner of Arizona and the 85-mile Fredonia Vermilion Cliffs 
Scenic Road (SR 89A) on the Arizona Strip above 
the Grand Canyon.
 State Transportation Board members on June 21 designated the two scenic routes.  
The highways will be placed on various tourist maps; be eligible for special funding for 
tourist facilities; have special scenic road signs, 
and receive special treatment from ADOT so that signs, guardrails and bridges blend in with 
the surrounding area.

Competitive government program comes to ADOT</h2></a>
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</font></strong> In today's work environment, companies of all sizes and in all industries are taking a hard look at the bottom line.  They are all asking themselves and their employees, "What can we do to become more competitive in the marketplace?" These days government is no different.<p>
ADOT is one of 36 state agencies currently evaluating products and services they are responsible for.  The goal is to ensure that state government is providing services at a level of quality and cost effectiveness that is competitive with private companies.<p>
The Competitive Government Program is the result of a bill signed into law by Governor Symington last May 1. The program outlines a way of identifying and evaluating government services to determine if the services are better provided from within ADOT or by an outside vendor.<p>
ADOT was a pilot agency in the development of this program.  The department's Competitive Government Committee is made up of 19 members representing a cross section of the department's divisions and organizations to review potential projects, ensuring an unbiased approach.<p>
"It is important for ADOT employees to realize that this program is not about privatization," explains Randy Berry, the program manager and a member of ADOT's Competitive Government Committee.  "Through this evaluation process, we are also discovering areas where outsourcing ADOT services may be more costly than creating new jobs within ADOT."<p>
According to Berry, the statewide program outlines specific steps the committee must follow to identify and evaluate government services.  If a service or function is identified as an area where the private sector could potentially do the job, it does not necessarily mean that service will be "privatized." State employees have the right to compete for the opportunity to provide that service and to prepare budgets and cost plans for that service.<p>
Before a service can be privatized, it must go through a two tier process.  The principal requirement is that the decision is based not only on cost, but the organization must provide a minimum of the same level or better service.<p>
In a recent letter to all ADOT employees, Director Larry Bonine stressed that the program's intent is not to "privatize" the department, but rather to encourage everyone to be more competitive in today's business environment.<p>

I-10 fronatage road project gets underway
</h2></a>
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Tucson</strong></font> A $4.2 million project to reconstruct two miles of the westbound frontage road on I-10 between Ruthrauff and Prince Roads on Tucson's north side was started in early September by Hunter Contracting Company of Gilbert.  The job will be completed in about a year.<p>
The project is the second in a series of frontage road projects that eventually will provide two-lane, continuous one-way frontage roads on both sides of 1-10 from Ruthrauff Road to the I-10/I-19 interchange, a distance of about eight miles.<p>
In addition to roadway reconstruction, the project includes rebuilding the westbound on-ramp at Prince Road and the westbound off-ramp at Ruthrauff Road; relocating utilities, and improving drainage structures for the future widening of the I-10 mainline.

Contract awarded for Squaw Peak freeway
</h2></a>
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</strong></font> The State Transportation Board has awarded a $36.2 million contract to build the next 2.2 miles of the Squaw Peak Freeway (SR 51) north from Shea Boulevard to Thunderbird Road in northeast Phoenix.  The contract was awarded to Meadow Valley Contracting, Inc., of Phoenix.<p>
The project will include construction of the north half of the interchange at Shea Boulevard, a full interchange at Cactus Road and a half-diamond interchange at Thunderbird Road.  The freeway will be recessed at Shea Boulevard and Cactus Road, and will be elevated at Indian Bend Wash and Thunderbird Road.<p>
Work will be completed by late 1998.  Later this year, the Transportation Board plans to award the contract for the Squaw Peak Freeway between Thunderbird and Bell Roads.  This section also will be finished by late 1998.

<font size=+3 color=#8b2252><Strong>w</Strong></font>hen it comes to landscaping on the Valley's regional freeway system, the question is one of colors.  How do we keep our freeways green without leaving the budget in the red? How can we balance the obligation to screen neighborhoods from noise and air pollution with the need to maintain cost sensitive landscapes?<p>
Faced with a limited budget to pay for attractive roadscapes, the Arizona Department of Transportation is working to answer these questions with a thrifty, yet engaging, freeway landscape program that beautifies our highways without breaking the bank.<p>
With just $1.2 billion left to build more than 70 miles of urban freeways in the Valley, scarce dollars must be largely directed toward opening more lanes to reduce congestion and facilitate the Valley's rapidly growing population.<p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Thanks to the work of a team of public and private sector participants, the challenge soon will be met as recommendations developed through a year's worth of hard work will start to be noticed in a pair of Valley landscape projects scheduled to begin this fall.<p>
On the new Sky Harbor Expressway, plans call for low maintenance cactus and wildflowers to accent native Hohokam and Hopi designs that recall past cultures.  These designs will include icons depicting ancient Native American art found on petroglyphs, pottery and baskets.<p>
Where ADOT might have spent $26,000 per acre to beautify his airport route just a few years ago, plans suggest it will only cost $19,000 per acre-a substantial savings that still yields pleasing results and provides a reduction of maintenance expenses by about 50 percent.  Future projects will be designed to deliver similar cost savings.<p>
A little southeast of the new Sky Harbor Expressway, ADOT is following another recommendation of its team: salvaging trees to save taxpayer money.<p>
More than 100 large trees planted along both sides of Interstate 10 in the late 1970's now are being moved from the path of freeway construction to a new home inside the I-10 Superstition Freeway traffic interchange.<p>
The trees will be spared a trip to the mulch pile and taxpayers will save thousands of dollars, since plants of similar size and quality could cost up to $4,000 each.  Compare the cost of the salvage operation, about $162,000, with the cost of new trees, up to $400,000, and the benefits are crystal clear!<p>
Sharing the cost of freeway landscape projects also will help coveted freeway dollars last longer.  Governor Fife Symington was the first to call on Valley communities to divide landscaping responsibilities, and several cities have since answered the challenge.  Today, ADOT has cooperative agreements with Glendale, Chandler and Phoenix to spread the cost of landscape construction and maintenance.<p>
As each new idea is tried and tested along our Valley freeway system, taxpayers will find ADOT delivering realistic freeway landscaping alternatives that make the roadsides inviting and save public dollars.

intersection built at University Drive, and leads 
motorists to the Hohokam Expressway (SR 143) and 
Interstate 10.
<P>During the construction, commuters are experiencing some major changes in 
their routes to and from the airport area.  The 
temporary extension of Air Lane between 44th Street and the Hohokam Expressway has 
been permanently closed while crews work to 
replace <BR>
that route with a new link between Air Lane and the Sky Harbor Expressway.
<P>The closures are needed to allow construction to move ahead on a new loop ramp 
from westbound Sky Harbor Boulevard to southbound SR 143.
<P>The $20 million construction project is a joint effort between ADOT and the City of 
Phoenix.  The 1.29 mile project is designed to help relieve congestion on the nearby Hohokam 
Expressway by creating a new route dedicated to airport traffic.  The Sky Harbor Expressway 
is scheduled to be completed this fall.

Eleven new miles of freeway opening
</H1></a>
<P>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><Strong>W</Strong></font>ith 11 new miles of freeway opening in the Valley, it's clear that ADOT's construction program is moving full speed ahead.<p>
These additional miles are the result of the Governor's Freeway Plan to reprioritize and accelerate construction on all corridors set into motion in December of 1994.  One of the major goals of the Governor's plan is to complete the Loop 101 outer loop to full freeway standards.  Two of these fall openings move ADOT closer to that goal, while another helps relieve congestion for airport commuters.<p></td>
The first freeway opening of the fall was the extension of the Sky Harbor Expressway (SR 153). This 1.29 mile segment of Sky Harbor Expressway was designed to provide airport area travelers and commuters with a convenient route into and out of the east side of Sky Harbor International Airport.<p>
The SR 153 now spans from Washington Street to University Drive with an interchange at Sky Harbor Boulevard.  The expressway serves as an alternate route across the Salt River.<p>
Resident Engineer Ebbie Attar oversaw the $20 million project with contractor Kiewit Western Company to completion.<p>
"This project was particularly demanding due to the challenges of working around the airport," explained Attar.  "Construction schedules and detours required special planning to keep airport traffic moving, especially during the Super Bowl."
The Sky Harbor Expressway opened on September 16, following a dedication ceremony held out on the freeway.<p>
The first segment of the Pima Freeway (Loop 101) from the Red Mountain Freeway (Loop 202) interchange north to Thomas Road opened to traffic on October 18. The 5 mile segment is the first portion of what will be a major north/south route in the east Valley, connecting Scottsdale with Tempe, Mesa and Chandler.  This $52 million project being constructed by Ball, Ball and Brosamer, features ramps at Rio Salado Parkway and interchanges at McKellips Road, McDowell Road and Thomas Road.<p>
"The construction of the first portion of the Pima Freeway has been a unique experience because it is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community," explains Mike Loo, resident engineer for ADOT.  "We have worked closely with the Indian Community to make this project happen.  The result is a freeway with features that highlight the Native American culture."<p>
With the opening of the mainline, the Red Mountain Interchange ramp connecting southbound Pima Freeway with the westbound Red Mountain Freeway will open, taking motorists from Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix.  The ramp from eastbound Red Mountain Freeway to northbound Pima Freeway is expected to open by March of 1997.  Other ramps of the interchange will open in phases through 1999.<p>
By mid-November, the 5.5 mile extension of the Agua Freeway (Loop 101) will open to motorists in the northwest Valley.  The Agua Fria Freeway project extends the Loop 101 from 75th Avenue to 35th Avenue along Beardsley Road.  This project was accelerated under the Governor's Freeway Plan in order to connect the 10 miles of the Agua Fria that have been open since 1990 with Interstate 17.  Resident Engineer Julio Alvarado is overseeing this $20 million project built by Sundt Corp.<p>
By early 1997, two of the ramps connecting the Agua Fria with I-17 will be completed.  Those freeway-to-freeway connections opening early next year are: the ramp connecting westbound Loop 101 with southbound I-17 and the ramp connecting southbound I-17 with westbound Loop 101. The remaining ramps of the west half of the Loop 101/I-17 interchange will open in phases from summer to fall of 1997.

<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>W</font></strong>hen a bridge designer wants to know how long or high a bridge should be over a river or wash, the first stop is the Bridge Drainage Section.<p>
"Basically, what we do is correlate the amount of rain that will be transformed into runoff in a channel at a highway crossing," said George Lopez-Cepero, manager of the eight-person section that also includes four engineers and three drainage designers.  "This is known as hydrology.<p>
"Once we know how much water in cubic meters per second will be traveling under a bridge, we do a hydraulic analysis to determine the depth, width and velocity of the flow," added Lopez-Cepero who has been the Bridge Drainage manager for 12 years.  "That serves as the basis to know how high and how long a bridge needs to be."<p>
To do their studies, the designers (all of whom are graduate engineers) and the engineers "read" topographic maps to delineate the drainage basin for a river or wash and to gather information on elevations, slopes and distances.<p>
The data is fed into state-of-the-art computer programs to calculate the information bridge designers need to know.<p>
"We make sure we use the latest technology available," said Lopez-Cepero, who joined ADOT in 1978.  "Today we have computer programs that can quickly forecast with accuracy and with a high degree of confidence.<p>
"This means we can spend our time looking into more details about all the factors that affect hydrology and hydraulics," he added.<p>
However, the Bridge Drainage Section is not satisfied with its technology.  The section is looking into linking digitized mapping with a computer program that will automatically provide information on water flowing toward a bridge site.<p>
The digitized mapping will provide a 3-D look at a drainage basin and the computer program will gather the information that is now done by "reading" topographic maps.
Lopez-Cepero said the new technology would permit the Bridge Drainage Section to complete its work faster.<p>

<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>ADOT</strong></font> is exploring new ways to fill up its civil engineering positions in rural districts with a diversed work force.  A new program encourages females and minority high school students to consider civil engineering careers, particularly at ADOT.
<p>
It provides materials called Transportation and Research Activities Center (TRAC) that include a sound level meter, ultrasonic motion detector, multipurpose lab interface and a computer that graphs the results of the variations in force or speed.<p>
The TRACPAC Education Program, jointly sponsored by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway  Administration, is a hands-on experience to conduct real engineering investigations in math and science classes.  TRAC also provides toll-free numbers to teachers for additional technical assistance with the program.<p>
Karen Halloway, Engineer-In-Training program manager, said AASHTO hopes to reach as many high schools as possible.  She said some communities in the Globe district showed great interest in the project even before receiving complete information.<p>
Holloway is looking for ADOT engineers in the rural areas to mentor the TRAC Program, especially next year when additional schools will be reached.  She also added, Northern Arizona University will help implement TRAC in Arizona.

Motor Vehicle Division cracking down on phony or 
unacceptable documents for driver licenses
</h1></a>
<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><Strong>A</Strong></font> tightened policy against the use of fraudulent documents to get Arizona driver or 
identification licenses has been implemented, the state Motor Vehicle Division has announced.
<P>Under a new state law, MVD is updating its policy on documents that will be 
accepted from someone applying for a license or ID card.  All applicants will need to provide 
verifiable documents which establish that he or she is legally entitled to obtain an Arizona license.
<P>MVD has developed a list of documents that can be used to obtain a driver license, 
instruction permit or ID card.  From that list, applicants can present two forms of approved 
identification, if one of them includes his or her photo, OR three forms of approved identification 
without a photo.
<P>While there is no estimate of how many people get licenses through the use of 
fraudulent documents, or how many licenses are obtained by people who are not legally entitled to them, 
it is known that the use of such licenses and documents is a serious problem in Arizona.
<P>In the hands of a dishonest person, an ill-gotten driver license can make it easier for 
the bearer to pass bad checks, rip off businesses, get undeserved government services and 
sometimes even assume an innocent person's identity.<p>

<strong> You must present two forms of identification, one of which has your photo, or provide three forms of approved identification which don't include a photo.  One of the documents submitted must be listed in column A listed below.  Other forms of ID submitted must be listed in either column A or B.<p></strong>

MVD inspectors recovering cars</h1></a>

<td align=left valign=top  width=250>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>I</strong></font>t's been a busy year for Motor Vehicle Division inspectors who have the job of looking out for stolen cars among the thousands of vehicles that are brought into MVD inspection centers.  Through the end of September, more than 275 cars and trucks that were either stolen or had stolen parts on them had been snared by division inspectors around the state.<p>
In Tucson, inspector George Collaco said teamwork is paying off for the squad of inspectors at MVD's Regional Service Center.  Collaco had just recorded the 50th stolen car intercepted this year at the Tucson facility.<p>

<font size=3  color=#8b2252>MVD Field Officer George Collaco verifies the identification number of a car at the Tucson Regional Service Center to determine if it is stolen.</font>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
"We're getting a lot of support," Collaco said .  "The management staff here answered the call when we said we needed the right tools and equipment in order to do a better job with inspections.  Equipment like better jacks to lift up cars has made our work easier, faster and safer to do."<p>
Collaco said he discovered 33 of the stolen cars at the Tucson center.  Scott Tankersley, now working at MVD's enforcement office in Globe, recovered 11 of the vehicles while Dan Valencia, who joined the Tucson staff in June, had nabbed six stolen cars, Collaco said.<p>
All the stolen cars recovered at the Tucson center were spotted as a result of "level two" inspections, which are required when vehicles listed as being salvaged or restored are going through the registration process.<p>
Mike Veucasovic, enforcement manager at MVD's Office of Special Investigations in Phoenix, said 90 percent of the 275 cars and trucks recovered as a result of MVD inspections were full vehicles, while the remaining 10 percent were cars with stolen parts, including engines.<p>
"Our inspectors have the job of making sure identification numbers on the cars match," he said.<p>
Collaco said his office prides itself on making sure that no level two inspection is completed until those vehicle identification numbers are located. <p> 
"We get a lot of assistance from our level one inspectors and that gives us the time to do thorough inspections without increasing our customer wait times," he said.<p>
Collaco, who spends a lot of time on his back looking for signs that a vehicle is stolen, said the level one inspectors do a good job sending cars to the level two stage when their initial check "just doesn't feel right."<p>
Once a car is identified as or suspected of being stolen, Veucasovic said MVD contacts local police or, in some cases, the Department of Public Safety.  Collaco said the Tucson police auto theft unit has spent countless hours assisting the MVD team with difficult inspections.

MVD taking steps to cut wait times</h1></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>T</strong></font>he woman had just arrived at the Motor Vehicle Division office in Kingman when she exclaimed, "Wow, this is great!" Not a comment usually associated with a trip to a driver license office, but in this case the woman was very happy MVD had set up a "greeter's station" where a staff member makes sure customers have all the right documents before they proceed with their license or vehicle title and registration business.<p>
That's one of a number of moves MVD is making to reduce both customer frustration and the amount of time spent waiting for service.  The division's equation looks like this: E + C = LW (hard working EMPLOYEES plus help from COMPUTERS equals LESS WAITING).  And the results have been impressive.<p>
From Bullhead City to Nogales, MVD reports show the average wait before a customer gets to a service counter is often well under 20 minutes.  MVD Director Russell Pearce has set a goal of getting that average wait time to less than 10 minutes.<p>
At the Kingman office, Customer Service Representative Faye Rainey said the hiring of two more employees this year has helped shrink the amount of time customers spend waiting for help.  MVD held a job fair in August to hire 125 workers in many offices across the state.<p>
As for computers, one of the major improvements at several MVD offices, including Kingman, is the Q-Matic customer traffic system.  This computerized system gives customers numbered tickets corresponding to the type of driver or auto license business they wish to transact.  The system works to determine which customer should go to which counter, with an emphasis on cutting time spent waiting.  An easy-to-read display board, with bright red lights, then shows the numbers of customers being served at the counters in the office.<p>
"The customers seem to really like it," Rainey said.  "In the past here in Kingman, people would sometimes wait as long as two hours just to find out they didn't have all the proper documents to get a license or get their car registered.  Now with the greeter helping to make sure the paperwork is right, plus the extra staffing and Q-Matic, people aren't wasting time."<p>
Diane Minton, MVD's assistant director for field/customer services, said the Q-Matic system updates and stores data on the amount of time spent waiting, as well as the types of services in demand <p>
 "It gives supervisors a chance to monitor and adjust to the flow of customers and their service needs." she said .  "The great thing is they can actually see if the changes they make are working."<p>
The Q-Matic system is being installed in more offices in the Phoenix and Tucson areas as well as greater Arizona.  Pearce wants almost all of the state's MVD service centers to have the system so that more and more customers can get out of line, in a manner of speaking.<p>

Organ donation change on driver licenses<br>
could help increase donors in Arizona
</H1></a>
<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>A</strong></font> change has been made to the Arizona driver license which could increase the number 
of organ donors in the state.  The change to the organ donation section of the license has 
been announced by the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division and Donor Network of Arizona (DNA).
<P>Under a new state law, Arizona driver licenses and state identification cards no 
longer include the section showing the words &quot;organ donor&quot; followed by a &quot;yes or no&quot; answer to 
the question of whether the person getting the license wishes to be an organ donor.
<P>Instead, people interested in becoming organ donors are asked to fill out organ donor 
cards provided by the Arizona Save-a-Life Alliance and then affix a sticker containing the word 
&quot;donor&quot; to the back of their licenses.
<P>This change is part of the 1996 Revised Arizona Anatomical Gift Act passed 
overwhelmingly by lawmakers and signed by Governor Fife Symington.  It is intended to give people 
more flexibility in changing their decision about being an organ donor.
<P>
<P>With Arizona providing an extended driver license that's valid for several years, 
people obtaining licenses now don't face the requirement of renewing their licenses in order to 
change their donor status from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes.&quot; A license holder is able to place one of the new 
&quot;donor&quot; stickers on the back of a license to notify others that he or she has filled out a donor card 
and wishes to be an organ donor.
<P>In addition to MVD offices, the Arizona Save-a-Life Alliance and Donor Network of 
Arizona is making the &quot;donor&quot; stickers available at other locations, including doctors offices.
<P>The change does not impact current licenses showing a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer to the 
organ donor question.

Motor Vehicle Division gets two-year registration program underway
</H1></a>
<P><font size=+3 color=#8b2252><strong>S</strong></font>ome owners of cars and trucks in Arizona will get a chance to register their vehicles 
once every two years under a new program, according to state Motor Vehicle Division Director 
Russell Pearce.
<P>MVD is notifying owners of vehicles qualifying for the two year registration program 
that they will save money by paying one $8 registration fee to cover the two-year registration 
period, instead of $16 for two separate annual registrations.
<P>Vehicles automatically selected for two-year registration are those with an annual 
vehicle license tax of $50 or less.  The vehicles also must either be exempt from emissions testing OR 
be scheduled to undergo an IM 240 emissions test for the first year of the two-year 
registration period.
<P>Owners of qualified vehicles not automatically selected for the two-year registration 
program because their annual vehicle license tax exceeds $50 will be able to participate on a 
voluntary basis.  Their vehicles would also need to be exempt from emissions testing OR be in the 
first year of the two-year IM 240 emissions testing cycle.
<P>The two-year registration program will benefit MVD customers in a number of ways.  
In addition to saving $8 dollars and postage in second year registration fees, customers won't 
have to deal with registering their vehicles every year.  MVD is working to keep customers 
from standing in line at driver and auto license offices.  Two-year registration will also allow MVD 
to reduce labor and postage costs involved in processing one-year registrations.

Out-of-state plate campaign <br>increases revenue for MVD

<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>B</strong></font>eefed up efforts to locate cars and trucks that should be registered in Arizona have 
paid off for the state, according to figures compiled by the Motor Vehicle Division.
<P>Last year MVD launched an aggressive campaign to register out of state vehicles driven 
by legal residents of Arizona.  Records show the number of out of state vehicles now being 
registered surged during the first half of this year.
<P>In the last six months of 1995, MVD recorded 80,600 out of state vehicle 
registrations and collected $11.8 million in vehicle license taxes for those cars and trucks.
<P>In the first six months of this year, the number of out of state registrations increased 
to 109,610.  Vehicle license taxes collected on those registrations totaled $16.4 million.

<U><I>Tips for preparing a resume that computers can read.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>NEW TECHNOLOGY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There's a new technology that could be very helpful to you.  It
could help you find your next job.  It's called electronic applicant
tracking, and it's being used by leading organizations in both
the public and private sectors.<BR>

<P>
By using the latest in document imaging technology, your resume
can be scanned into a computer system and kept &quot;alive&quot;
for a long period of time.  In our system, your resume will be
kept active (alive) for six months.  The computer can search for
just about anything in your resume.  You could be qualified and
considered for jobs you never thought of.  The computer can make
it easier for you to be considered for more jobs, and it keeps
your <U>one</U> resume on file so it's quicker to update your
information.<BR>

<P>
Here's how it works.  Your resume is scanned into the computer
as an image.  Then OCR (optical character recognition) software
looks at the image to distinguish every letter and number (character)
and creates a text file (ASCII).  Then artificial intelligence
&quot;reads&quot; the text and extracts the important information
about you such as your name, address, phone number, work history,
years of experience, education, and skills.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>NEW OPPORTUNITY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Why is it important for you to know this?  When you prepare a
resume for the computer to read, you want it to be &quot;scannable&quot;.
 A scannable resume is clean so the scanner can get a clear image.
 A scannable resume has standard fonts and crisp, dark type such
as a laser printer or a typewriter with a new ribbon would produce,
so the OCR can recognize every letter. A scannable resume
has plenty of facts for the artificial intelligence to extract.
 <U>The more skills and facts you provide, the more opportunities
you'll have for your skills to match available positions.<BR>
</U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>A SCANNABLE RESUME:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Maximizes the computer's ability to &quot;read&quot; your resume.
<LI>Maximizes your ability to get &quot;hits&quot; (a hit is when one of your skills matches a skill 
for which the computer is searching).<BR>
</UL>
Preparing a scannable resume is easy.  Like the traditional style
resume, you focus on format and content.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>FORMAT<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
To maximize the computer's ability to read your resume, provide
a clean, clear resume in a standard resume format.  The computer
can extract skills from many styles of resume including chronological
(list your <U>jobs in order by date</U>, with your current/most
recent job first), functional (organized by skills), and any combination
of these styles.<BR>

<P>
The most difficult resume for the computer to read is a poor quality
copy with an unusual layout, such as a newspaper layout, adjusted
spacing, large font sizes, lines/graphics, type that is too light,
or paper that is too dark.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR BETTER SCANNABILITY<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use white or light colored 8-1/2 x 11 paper, printed on <U>one
side only</U>, with 1-1/2 inch margins.
<LI>Use a laser printed original if possible.  A typewritten original,
a letter quality dot matrix, or a high quality photocopy is also
OK.
<LI>Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, bullets and
boxes.
<LI>Don't condense spacing between letters or lines.
<LI>Use <B>bold face </B>and/or ALL CAPITAL LETTERS for section
headings as long as the letters don't touch each other.
<LI>Use standard typefaces such as <FONT FACE="Arial">Arial</FONT>,
Futura, Optima, Univers, Times New Roman, Palatino, Aquiline Book,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Courier</FONT></TT>, with a font
size of 10 to 14 points.  (Avoid Times 10 point.)
<LI>Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, <U>underline, </U>shadows,
and reverses (white letters on black background).
<LI>Avoid two-column formats or resumes that look like newspapers
or newsletters.
<LI>Place your name at the <U>top</U> of the page <U>on its own
line</U>.  (Your name should also be the first text that appears
on subsequent pages.)
<LI>Use a standard address format below your name and list each
phone number on its own line.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>CONTENT<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The computer extracts information from your resume.  You can use
your current resume; however, once you understand what the computer
searches for, you may wish to include <U>key words</U> to increase
your opportunities for matching requirements or getting &quot;hits&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
Employment staff access the resume database in many ways, searching
for applicants with specific backgrounds.  When searching for
specific backgrounds, they will search for key words, usually
nouns such as writing, BA, marketing, programming administration,
counseling, RN, bilingual, Spanish (language fluency), etc.  So
make sure that you describe your education and experience with
concrete words rather than vague descriptions.  The computer system
will extract the words and information from your sentences.  <U>You
can write your resume as usual.<BR>
</U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING &quot;HITS&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use enough key words to define your skills, experience, education,
professional affiliations, etc.  
<LI>Describe your experience with concrete words rather than vague
descriptions.  For example, it's better to use <B>&quot;managed
a team doing software engineering&quot;</B> than &quot;responsible
for managing, training&#133;&quot;
<LI><U><B>Use more than one page if necessary</B></U>.  The computer
can easily handle multiple page resumes, and it uses all of the
information it extracts from your resume to determine if your
skills match available positions.  It allows you to provide more
information than you would for a human reader.
<LI>Use jargon and acronyms specific to your industry, but remember
to spell out acronyms for human readers.
<LI>Increase your list of key words by including specifics, for
example, list the names of software you use such as WordPerfect,
Microsoft Word, Lotus 1-2-3, Fox Pro, etc.  Remember, however,
that the system has a limit to the amount of information that
it can extract from your resume.  Therefore, you may wish to place
more important information near the beginning of your resume.
<LI>Use typical resume headings such as:  Objective, Experience,
Employment, Work History, Positions held, Appointments, Skills,
Summary, Summary of Qualifications, Accomplishments, Strengths,
Education, Professional Affiliations, Publications, Papers, Licenses,
Certifications, Examinations, Honors, Personal, Additional, Miscellaneous,
References, etc.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Some people may want to have <U>two</U> versions of their resume,
one with a scannable format and detailed information for the computer
to read (<U>send this one</U>) and one with a creative layout,
enhanced typography, and summarized information to carry to the
interview for people to read.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR PREPARING AN EFFECTIVE SCANNABLE RESUME:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use <U>white</U> or <U>light colored</U> standard <U>letter
size paper</U>.
<LI>Make sure the resume you submit is <U>clean and clearly readable</U>.
<LI>Use <U>standard typefaces</U> between <U>10 and 14 points</U>
in size.
<LI>Place your <U>name at the top of the page</U>, use a <U>standard
format for your address</U>, and place <U>each phone number</U>
you list <U>on a separate line</U>.
<LI>Describe your background in <U>detail</U> using <U>concrete</U>,
<U>key words</U> rather than vague, fuzzy descriptions.
<LI><U>Use as many pages as you need</U> to provide a clear and
detailed description of your background.
<LI>Use any <U>standard</U> resume format.

<P><B>As you can see the pay out from ASRS is far greater on a much smaller
amount of contributions. As the percentage of the salary you purchase increases
the greater the monthly benefit. If eligible, you may purchase prior covered
public service, military service and refunded ASRS service.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>**It would take an accumulation of $75,000 in the mutual fund and
a payout factor in the 6.5% range to equal the ASRS payment. </B><BR>

</TD><TD align=left  width=65%  valign=top><STRONG>Norman Wallace,</STRONG> shown here in 1976, was the photographer for the vintage photos that appear in this collection. Mr. Wallace was as well known in the old Arizona Highway Department for his photography as he was for his accomplishments as a highway location engineer.
<P>
Mr. Wallace, who died in 1983 at the age of 98, took nearly 2,700 photos of early road construction in Arizona during the 23 years he was employed by the Arizona Highway Department from 1934 to his retirement in 1955.
<P>
His photos, which are meticulously annotated, were turned over to the state in 1968 and are now housed at Arizona Highways Magazine, which has published many of the photos.
<P>
Mr. Wallace also was known in the Arizona Highway Department as the man who surveyed and located the old Black Canyon Highway between Phoenix and Flagstaff. He walked from Phoenix to Flagstaff twice to find the best route for the road.

<H2>PREPARING TO RIDE</H2>
What you do before you start a trip goes a long way toward determining
whether or not you'll get where you want to go safely.  Before taking off on
any trip, a safe rider makes a point to:
<UL>
<LI>wear the right gear.
<LI>check the motorcycle equipment.
<LI>become familiar with the motorcycle.
</UL>
<A NAME="a"><H3>WEAR THE RIGHT GEAR</H3>
When you ride, your gear is "right" if it protects you.  In any collision, you
have a far better chance of avoiding serious injury if you wear:
<UL>
<LI>an approved helmet.
<LI>face or eye protection.
<LI>protective clothing.
</UL>
<A NAME="b"><H4>The Helmet</H4></A>
Collisions are not rare events - particularly among beginning riders.
And one out of every five motorcycle collisions result in head or neck
injuries. Head injuries are just as severe as neck injuries - and far more
common.  Accident analyses show that head and neck injuries account for
a majority of serious and fatal injuries to motorcyclists.  Research also
shows that, with few exceptions, head and neck injuries are reduced by the
proper wearing of an approved helmet.
<H4>Helmet Use</H4>
Some riders don't wear helmets because they think helmets will limit
their view to the sides.  Others wear helmets only on long trips or when
riding at high speeds.  Here are some facts to consider:
<UL>
<LI>An approved helmet lets you see as far to the sides as necessary. A study
of more than 900 motorcycle collisions, where 40% of the riders wore
helmets, did not find even one case in which a helmet kept a rider from
spotting danger.
<LI>Most collisions happen on short trips (less than five miles long), just a few
minutes after starting out.
<LI>Most riders are riding slower than 30 mph when a collision occurs. At
these speeds, helmets can cut both the number and the severity of head
injuries by half.
</UL>
No matter what the speed, helmeted riders are three times more likely to
survive head injuries than those not wearing helmets at the time of the
collision.
<H4>Helmet Selection</H4>
There are two primary types of helmets, providing two different levels
of coverage: three-quarter and full face.
<P>
Whichever style you choose, you can get the most protection by making
sure that the helmet:
<UL>
<LI>meets U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and state standards.
Helmets with labels from the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) or the Snell Memorial Foundation give you an added assurance
of quality.
<LI>fits snugly, all the way around.
<LI>has no obvious defects such as cracks, loose padding or frayed straps.
</UL>
Whatever helmet you decide on, keep it securely fastened on your head
when you ride.  Otherwise, if you are involved in a collision, it's likely to
fly off your head before it gets a chance to protect you.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="p2.gif" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=129>
</CENTER>
<A NAME="c"><H4>Eye and Face Protection</H4></A>
A plastic faceshield can help protect your whole face in a collision.  It also
protects you from wind, dust, dirt, rain, insects, and pebbles thrown up
from cars ahead.  These problems are distracting and can be painful.  If you
have to deal with them, you can't devote your full attention to the road.
<P>
Goggles protect your eyes, though they won't protect the rest of your face
like a faceshield does.  A windshield is not a substitute for a faceshield or
goggles.  Most windshields will not protect your eyes from the wind.
Neither will eyeglasses or sunglasses.  Glasses won't keep your eyes from
watering, and they might blow off when you turn your head while riding.
<P>
To be effective, eye or faceshield protection must:
<UL>
<LI>Be free of scratches.
<LI>Be made of shatter-proof material.
<LI>Give a clear view to either side.
<LI>Fasten securely, so it does not blow off.
<LI>Permit air to pass through, to reduce fogging.
<LI>Permit enough room for eyeglasses or sunglasses, if needed.
</UL>
Tinted eye protection should not be worn at night or any other time when
little light is available.
<A NAME="d"><H4>Clothing</H4></A>
The right clothing protects you in a collision.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Jacket and pants</EM></STRONG> should cover arms and
legs completely.  They should fit snugly enough to keep from flapping in the wind,
yet loosely enough to move freely.  Leather offers the most protection, but heavy
denim usually does an adequate job at a reasonable price.  Sturdy synthetic
material allows a lot of protection as well.  Wear a jacket even in warm
weather.  Many are designed to protect without getting you overheated,
even on summer days.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Boots or shoes</EM></STRONG> should be high and sturdy
enough to cover your ankles and give them support.  Soles should be made of hard,
durable material.  Keep heels short so they do not catch on rough surfaces.  Tuck
laces in so they won't catch on your motorcycle.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Gloves</EM></STRONG> allow a better grip and help protect
your hands in a collision.  Your gloves should be made of leather or heavy cloth.
<P>
In cold or wet weather, your clothes should keep you warm and dry, as
well as protect you from injury.  You cannot control a motorcycle well if you
are numb.  Riding for long periods in cold weather can cause severe chill
and fatigue.  A winter jacket should resist wind and fit snugly at the neck,
wrists, and waist.  Good-quality rainsuits designed for motorcycle riding
resist tearing apart or ballooning up at high speeds.
<P>
<STRONG>
1. A plastic face shield:<BR>
<DD>A. is not necessary if you have a windshield.
<DD>B. only protects your eyes.
<DD>C. helps protect your whole face.
<DD>D. does not protect your face as well as goggles.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="e"><H3>KNOW YOUR MOTORCYCLE</H3></A>
There are plenty of things on the highway that can cause you trouble.
Your motorcycle should not be one of them.  To make sure that your
motorcycle won't let you down:
<UL>
<LI>Start with the right motorcycle for you.
<LI>Be familiar with the motorcycle controls.
<LI>Check the motorcycle before every ride.
<LI>Keep it in safe riding condition between rides.
<LI>Avoid add-ons and modifications that make your cycle harder to handle.
</UL>
<A NAME="f"><H3>The Right Motorcycle for You</H3></A>
First, make sure your motorcycle is right for you.  It should "fit" you.
Your feet should reach the ground while you are seated on the cycle.
<P>
At minimum, your street-legal cycle should have:
<UL>
<LI>Headlight, taillight and brakelight
<LI>Front and rear brakes
<LI>Turn signals
<LI>Horn
<LI>Two mirrors
</UL>
<A NAME="g"><H4>Borrowing and Lending</H4></A>
Borrowers and lenders of motorcycles, beware.  Collisions are fairly
common among beginning riders -- especially in the first months of riding.
Riding an unfamiliar cycle adds to the problem.  If you borrow a motorcycle,
get familiar with it in a controlled area.  And if you lend your
motorcycle to friends, make sure they are licensed and know how to ride
before allowing them out into traffic.
<P>
No matter how experienced you may be, ride extra carefully on any bike
that's new or unfamiliar to you.  More that half of all collisions occur on
motorcycles ridden by the operator for less than six months.
<A NAME="h"><H4>Get Familiar with the Motorcycle Controls</H4></A>
Make sure you are completely familiar with the motorcycle before you
take it out on the street.  This is particularly important if you are riding a
borrowed cycle.  If you are going to use an unfamiliar motorcycle:
<UL>
<LI>Make all the checks you would on your own cycle.
<LI>Find out where everything is, particularly the turn signals, horn, headlight
switch, fuel-control valve, and engine cut-off switch.  Find and
operate these items without having to look for them.
<LI>Know the gear pattern. Work the throttle, clutch, and brakes a few times
before you start riding.  All controls react a little differently.
<LI>Ride very cautiously. Accelerate gently, take turns more slowly, and
leave extra room for stopping.

<A NAME="i"><H4>Check the Motorcycle</H4></A>
A motorcycle needs more frequent attention than a car.  A minor technical
failure in a car seldom leads to anything more than an inconvenience for the
driver.
<P>
If something's wrong with the motorcycle, you'll want to find out about
it before you get in traffic.  Make a complete check of your motorcycle before
every ride.
<P>
Before mounting the motorcycle make the following checks:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Tires</EM></STRONG> --- Check the air pressure.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Fluids</EM></STRONG> --- Oil and fluid levels. At a
minimum, check hydraulic fluids and coolants weekly.  Look under the bike for
signs of an oil or gas leak.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Headlights and Taillight</EM></STRONG> --- Check
them both.  Test your dimmer to make sure both high and low beams are working.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Turn Signals</EM></STRONG> --- Turn on both right
and left turn signals.  Make sure all four lights flash.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Brake Light</EM></STRONG> --- Try both brake controls,
and make sure each one turns on the brake light.
</UL>
Once you have mounted the motorcycle, complete the following checks
before starting out:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Clutch and Throttle</EM></STRONG> --- Make sure
they work smoothly.  The throttle should snap back when you let go.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Mirrors</EM></STRONG> --- Clean and adjust both
mirrors before starting.  It's difficult to ride with one hand while you try to
adjust a mirror.  Adjust each mirror so you can see the lane behind and as
much as possible of the lane next to you.  When properly adjusted, a mirror may
show the edge of your arm or shoulder - but it's the road behind and to the
side that's most important.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Brakes</EM></STRONG> --- Try the front and rear
brake levers one at a time.  Make sure each one feels firm and holds the
motorcycle when the brake is fully applied.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Horn</EM></STRONG> --- Try the horn.  Make sure it works.
</UL>
In addition to the checks you should make before every trip, check the
following items at least once a week: Wheels, cables, fasteners and brakes.
<P>
<STRONG>
2. More than half of all collisions:<BR>
<DD>A. occur at speeds greater than 35 mph.
<DD>B. happen at night.
<DD>C. are caused by worn tires.
<DD>D. involve riders who have ridden their cycles less than six months.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="j"><H3>KNOW YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES</H3></A>
"Accident" implies an unforseen event that occurs without anyone's
fault or negligence.  Most often in traffic, that is not the case.  In fact, most
people involved in a collision can usually claim some responsibility for
what takes place.
<P>
Consider a situation where someone decides to try to squeeze through an
intersection on a yellow light turning red.  Your light turns green.  You pull
into the intersection without checking for possible latecomers.  That is all
it takes for the two of you to tangle.  It was the driver's responsibility to stop.
And it was your responsibility to look before pulling out.  Neither of you
held up your end of the deal.  Just because someone else is the first to start
the chain of events leading to a collision, it doesn't leave any of us free of
responsibility.
<P>
As a rider you can't be sure that other operators will see you or yield the
right of way.  To lessen your chances of a collision occurring:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Be visible</EM></STRONG> --- wear proper
clothing, use your headlight, ride in the best lane position.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Communicate your intentions</EM>
</STRONG> --- use the proper signals, brake light and lane position.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Maintain an adequate space cushion</EM>
</STRONG> --- following, being followed, lane sharing, passing and
being passed.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Scan your path of travel 12 seconds ahead.</EM>
</STRONG>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Identify and separate multiple hazards.</EM></STRONG>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Be prepared to act</EM></STRONG> --- remain alert
and know how to carry out proper collision-avoidance skills.
</UL>
Blame doesn't matter when someone is injured in a crash.  There is rarely
a single cause of any collision.  The ability to ride aware, make critical
decisions, and carry them out separates responsible riders from all the rest.
Remember, it is up to you to keep from being the cause of, or an unprepared
participant in, any collision.

<H2>RIDE WITHIN YOUR ABILITIES</H2>
This Manual cannot teach you how to control direction, speed, or balance.
That's something you can learn only through practice.  But control begins
with knowing your abilities and riding within them and the rules of the
road.
<A NAME="a"><H3>BASIC VEHICLE CONTROL</H3></A>
<A NAME="b"><H4>Body Position</H4></A>
To control a motorcycle well:
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Seat</EM></STRONG> --- Sit far enough forward
so that arms are slightly bent when you hold the handlegrips.  Bending
your arms permits you to turn the handlebars without having to stretch.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Hands</EM></STRONG> --- Hold the handlegrips
firmly to keep your grip over rough surfaces.  Start with your right wrist
down.  This will help you keep from accidentally using too much throttle
- especially if you need to reach for the brake suddenly.  Also, adjust the
handlebars so your hands are even with or below your elbows.  This
permits you to use the proper muscles for precision steering.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p8.gif" WIDTH=340 HEIGHT=123></CENTER>
<STRONG><EM>Knees</EM></STRONG> --- Keep your knees against
the gas tank to help you keep your balance as the motorcycle turns.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Feet</EM></STRONG> --- Keep your feet firmly on the
foot pegs to maintain balance.  Don't drag your feet.  If your foot catches on
something, you can be injured and it could affect your control of the motorcycle.
Keep your feet near the controls so you can get to them fast if needed.  Also,
don't let your toes point downward - they may get caught between the road and
the footpegs.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Posture</EM></STRONG> --- Sit so you can use your arms
to steer the motorcycle rather than to hold yourself up.
<A NAME="c"><H4>Shifting Gears</H4></A>
There is more to shifting gears than simply getting the motorcycle to pick
up speed smoothly.  Learning to use the gears correctly when downshifting,
turning, or starting on hills is important for safe motorcycle operation.
<P>
Shift down through the gears as you slow or stop.  Remain in first gear
while you are stopped so that you can move out quickly if you need to.
<P>
Make certain you are riding slowly enough when you shift into a lower
gear.  If not, the motorcycle will lurch, and the rear wheel may skid.  When
riding downhill or shifting into first gear you may need to use the brakes
to slow enough before downshifting safely.
<P>
It is best to change gears before entering a turn.  However, sometimes
shifting while in the turn is necessary.  If so, remember to do so smoothly.
A sudden change in power to the rear wheel can cause a skid.
<A NAME="d"><H4>Braking</H4></A>
Your motorcycle has two brakes: one each for the front and rear wheel.
Use both of them at the same time.  The front brake is more powerful and
can provide as much as three-quarters of your total stopping power.  The
front brake is safe to use if you use it properly.  Remember:
<UL>
<LI>Use both brakes <STRONG><EM>every time</EM></STRONG> you
slow or stop. Using only the rear brake for "normal" stops will not permit you
to develop the habit or skill of using the front brake properly in an emergency.
<BR>Squeeze the frontbrake and press down on the rear.  Grabbing at the front brake or jamming down on the rear can cause the brakes to lock, resulting
in control problems.
<LI>Apply both brakes <STRONG><EM>at the same time</EM></STRONG>.
The sooner you apply the front brake, the sooner it will start slowing you down.<LI>If you know the technique, using both brakes in a turn is possible,
although it should be done very carefully.  When leaning the motorcycle
some of the traction is used for cornering.  Less traction is available for
stopping.  A skid can occur if you apply too much brake.  Also, using the
front brake incorrectly on a slippery surface may be hazardous.  Use
caution and squeeze the brake lever.
<LI>Some motorcycles have integrated braking systems that link the front and
rear brakes together by applying the rear brake pedal. (Consult the
owner's manual for detailed explanation on the operation and effective
use of these systems.)
</UL>
<A NAME="e"><H4>Turning</H4></A>
Riders often try to take curves or turns too fast.  When they can't hold the
turn, they end up crossing into another lane of traffic or going off the road.
Or, they overreact and brake too hard, causing a skid and loss of control.
Approach turns and curves with caution.
<P>
Use four steps for better control: 
<UL>
<LI>SLOW
<LI>LOOK
<LI>LEAN
<LI>ROLL
</UL>
<STRONG><EM>SLOW</EM></STRONG> --- Reduce speed before
the turn by closing the throttle and, if necessary, applying both brakes.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>LOOK</EM></STRONG> --- Look through the turn to
where you want to go.  Turn just your head, not your shoulders, and keep
your eyes level with the horizon.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>LEAN</EM></STRONG> --- To turn, the motorcycle
must lean.  To lean the motorcycle, push on the handgrip in the direction
of the turn.  Push left - lean left - go left.  Push right - lean right - go right.
Higher speeds and/or tighter turns require the motorcycle to lean more.
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>In normal turns, the rider and the motorcycle should
lean together at the same angle.</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="p10.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=169></TD>
<TD>In slow tight turns, lean the motorcycle only
and keep your body straight.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<STRONG><EM>ROLL</EM></STRONG> --- Roll on the throttle
through the turn.  Maintain steady speed or accelerate gradually.
Avoid decelerating in the turn.
<P>
<STRONG>
3. When riding you should:<BR>
<DD>A. turn your head and shoulders to look through turns.
<DD>B. keep your arms straight.
<DD>C. keep your knees away from the gas tank.
<DD>D. turn just your head and eyes to look where you are going.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="f"><H3>KEEPING YOUR DISTANCE</H3>
The best protection you can have is distance - a "cushion of space" -
all around your cycle.  If someone else makes a mistake, distance permits
you:
<UL>
<LI>time to react.
<LI>room to maneuver.
</UL>
<A NAME="g"><H4>Lane Positions</H4></A>
In some ways the size of the motorcycle can work to your advantage.
Each traffic lane gives a motorcycle three paths of travel, as indicated in the
illustration.
<P>
Your lane position should:
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>increase your ability to see and be seen.
<LI>avoid other's blind spots.
<LI>avoid surface hazards.
</UL></TD>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>protect your lane from other drivers.
<LI>communicate your intentions.
<LI>avoid wind blast from other vehicles.
<LI>provide an escape route.
</UL></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p11.gif" WIDTH=325 HEIGHT=181></CENTER>
Select the appropriate path to maximize your space cushion and make
yourself more easily seen by others on the road.
<P>
In general, there is no single best position for riders to be seen and to
maintain a space cushion around the cycle.  No portion of the lane need be
avoided - including the center.  If hazardous conditions exist on both sides
of you, the center of the lane is usually your best option.
<P>
The center of a lane can be oily.  It collects the drippings from cars -
particularly at intersections.  This strip is usually no more than two feet
wide.  The center mini-lane is four feet wide.  You can operate to the left or
right of the grease strip and still be within the center portion of the traffic
lane.  Unless the road is wet, the average center strip permits adequate
traction to ride on safely.  Avoid riding on big build-ups of oil and grease
that are usually found at very busy intersections or toll booths.
<P>
Ride in the portion of the lane where you are <EM>most</EM> likely to be seen.Depending on the traffic situation, move to the portion of the lane where
it will be most difficult for other drivers to miss seeing you.
<A NAME="h"><H4>Following Another Vehicle</H4></A>
"Following too closely" is a major factor in collisions caused by
motorcyclists.  In traffic, motorcycles need as much distance to stop as cars.
Normally, a minimum of two seconds distance should be <EM>maintained</EM> behind the vehicle ahead.  To gauge your following distance:
<UL>
<LI>Pick out a marker, such as a pavement marking or lamppost, on or near
the road ahead.
<LI>When the rear bumper of the vehicle ahead passes the marker, count off
the seconds: "one-second-one, one-second-two."
<LI>If you reach the marker before you reach "two",  you are following too
closely.
</UL>
A two-second following distance leaves a minimum amount of space to
stop or swerve if the driver ahead stops suddenly.  It also permits a better
view of potholes and other hazards in the road.
<P>
A larger cushion of space is needed if your motorcycle will take longer
than normal to stop.  If pavement is slippery, if you cannot see through the
vehicle ahead, or if traffic is heavy and someone may squeeze in front of
you, open up a three second or more following distance.
<P>
Keep well behind the vehicle ahead even when you are stopped.  This will
make it easier to get out of the way if someone bears down on you from
behind.  It will also give you a cushion of space if the vehicle ahead starts
to back up for some reason.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p13.gif" WIDTH=345 HEIGHT=187></CENTER>
When behind a car, ride where the driver can see you in his rearview
mirror.  Riding in the center portion of the lane should put your image in
the middle of the rearview mirror - where a driver is most likely to see you.
<P>
Riding at the far side of a lane may permit a driver to see you in a sideview
mirror.  But remember that most drivers don't look at their sideview
mirrors nearly as often as they check the rearview mirror.  If the traffic
situation allows, the center portion of the lane is the best place for you to
be seen by the drivers ahead and to prevent lane sharing by others.
<H4>Being Followed</H4>
Speeding up to lose someone following too closely only ends up with
someone tailgating you at a higher speed.
<P>
A better way to handle tailgaters is to get them in front of you.  When
someone is following too closely, change lanes and let them pass.  If you
can't do this, slow down and open up extra space ahead of you to allow
room for both you and the tailgater to stop. This will also encourage them
to pass.  If they don't pass, you will have given yourself and the tailgater
more time and space to react in case an emergency does develop.
<A NAME="i"><H4>Passing and Being Passed</H4></A>
Passing and being passed by another vehicle is not much different than
with a car.  However, visibility is more critical.  Be sure other drivers see
you, and that you see potential hazards.
<H4>Passing</H4>
<IMG SRC="p14.gif" WIDTH=147 HEIGHT=223 ALIGN=right>
1. Ride in the left portion of the lane at a safe following distance to
increase your line of sight and make you more visible.  Signal and
check for oncoming traffic.  Use your mirrors and turn your head
to look for traffic behind.
<P>
2. Move into the left lane and accelerate.  Select a lane position that
doesn't crowd the car you are passing and provides space to avoid
hazards in your lane.
<P>
3. Ride through the blind spot as quickly as possible.
<P>
4. Signal again, and complete mirror and headchecks before returning
to your original lane.
<P>
<STRONG>Remember, passes must be completed within posted speed limits, and
only where permitted.  Know your signs and road markings!</STRONG>
<H4>Being Passed</H4>
When you are being passed from behind or by an oncoming vehicle, stay
in the center portion of your lane.  Riding any closer to them could put you
in a hazardous situation.  Avoid being hit by:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>The other vehicle</EM></STRONG> --- A slight
mistake by you or the passing driver could cause a sideswipe.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Extended mirrors</EM></STRONG> --- Some
drivers forget that their mirrors hang out farther than their fenders.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Objects thrown from windows</EM>
</STRONG> --- Even if the driver knows you're there, a passenger may
not see you and might toss something on you or the road ahead of you.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Blasts of wind from larger vehicles</EM>
</STRONG> --- They can affect your control. You have more room for
error if you are in the middle portion when hit by this blast than if you
are on either side of the lane.
</UL>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p15.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=151></CENTER>
<STRONG>Do not</STRONG> move into the portion of the lane farthest from the passing vehicle.
It might invite the other driver to cut back into your lane too early.
<A NAME="j"><H4>Lane Sharing</H4></A>
Cars and motorcycles need a full lane to operate safely.  Lane sharing is
usually prohibited.
<P>
Riding between rows of stopped or moving cars in the same lane can
leave you vulnerable to the unexpected.  A hand could come out of a
window; a door could open; a car could turn suddenly.  Discourage lane
sharing by others.  Keep a center-portion position whenever drivers might
be tempted to squeeze by you.  Drivers are most tempted to do this:
<UL>
<LI>In heavy, bumper-to-bumper traffic.
<LI>When they want to pass you.
<LI>When you are preparing to turn at an intersection.
<LI>When you are getting in an exit lane, or leaving a highway.
</UL>
<A NAME="k"><H4>Merging Cars</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p16a.gif" WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=207 ALIGN=right>
Drivers on an entrance ramp may not see you on the
highway.  Give them plenty of room.  Change to
another lane if one is open.  If there is no room for a lane
change, adjust speed to open up space for the
merging driver.<P>
<A NAME="l"><H4>Cars Alongside</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p16b.gif" WIDTH=146 HEIGHT=197 ALIGN=right >
Do not ride next to cars or trucks in other
lanes  if you do not have to.  You might be
in the blind spot of a car in the next lane,
which could switch into your lane without
warning.  Cars in the next lane also block your
escape if you come upon danger in your own lane.
Speed up or drop back to find a place clear of
traffic on both sides.
<P>
<STRONG>
4. Usually, a good way to handle tailgaters is to:
<DD>A. change lanes and let them pass.
<DD>B. use your horn and make obscene gestures.
<DD>C. speed up to put distance between you and the tailgater.
<DD>D. ignore them.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="m"><H3>SIPDE</H3></A>
Experienced riders make a practice of being aware of what is going on
around them.  They improve their riding strategy by using a system known
as SIPDE.
<P>
SIPDE is an acronym for the process used to make judgments and act in
traffic.  It stands for:
<STRONG><UL>
<LI> Scan
<LI>Identify
<LI>Predict
<LI>Decide
<LI>Execute
</UL></STRONG>
Let's examine each of these steps.
<H4>Scan</H4>
Search aggressively for potential hazards.  Scanning provides the
information you need to make decisions in enough time to act accordingly.
Looking ahead for hazards and potential escape routes is especially critical
at intersections.
<P>
Before you enter an intersection, search for:
<UL>
<LI>Oncoming traffic that may turn left in front of you.
<LI>Traffic from the left.
<LI>Traffic from the right.
<LI>Traffic approaching from behind.
</UL>
Be especially alert at intersections with limited visibility.  Visually "busy"
surroundings could camouflage you and your motorcycle.
<H4>Identify</H4>
Locate hazards and potential conflicts.  Hazards are divided into three
groups based on how severe their effect on you may be.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Cars, trucks and other vehicles</EM>
</STRONG> ---They share the road with you and move
quickly.  Your reactions to them must be quick and accurate.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Pedestrians and animals</EM>
</STRONG> --- They are unpredictable and make short, quick moves.<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Stationary objects</EM></STRONG> --- Potholes,
guard rails, bridges, roadway signs, hedges, or rows of trees are stationary
obstacles.  They won't move into your path, but may influence or complicate your riding strategy.
<H4>Predict</H4>
Anticipate how the hazard may affect you.  Speed, distance, and the
direction in which a potential hazard is moving are important.  A car
moving into your path is more critical than one moving away.
<P>
Determine how critical the hazard is, if a collision is probable, and where
it might occur. This is the "What if ... ?" phase of SIPDE that depends on
knowledge and experience.  Estimate the consequences of the hazard.  How
might the hazard - or your effort to avoid it - affect you and others?
<H4>Decide</H4>
There are only three things you can do to reduce the hazard:
<UL>
<LI>Communicate your presence.
<LI>Adjust your speed.
<LI>Adjust your position.
</UL>
Communication is the most passive action you can take since it depends
on the response of someone else.  Use your lights and horn, but don't rely
on the action of others.
<P>
Adjust your speed by accelerating, slowing or stopping.
<P>
Change lane position or completely change direction to adjust your position.
<P>
Adjust speed or position depending on the nature of the hazard and how
much time and space you have.
<P>
In areas of high potential risk, such as intersections, reduce the time you
to react.  <U>Cover both brakes and the clutch.  Be ready with possible
escape routes.</U>
<H4>Execute</H4>
Carry out your decision.  Hopefully by now your riding skills are second
nature.  Even the best decision is meaningless without the skills to carry it
out.  Know your limits and ride within them.
<P>
<STRONG>
5. To reduce your reaction time, you should:
<DD>A. ride slower than the speed limit.
<DD>B. cover the clutch and the brakes.
<DD>C. shift into neutral when slowing.
<DD>D. pull in the clutch when turning.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="n"><H3>INTERSECTIONS</H3></A>
The greatest potential for conflict between you and other traffic is at
intersections.  An intersection can be in the middle of an urban area or at
a driveway on a residential street - anywhere traffic may cross your path
of travel.  Over half of motorcycle/car collisions are caused by drivers
entering a rider's right-of-way.  Oncoming cars that turn left in front of you,
and cars on side streets that pull into your lane, are the two biggest dangers.
Your use of <A HREF="section2.htm#m"> SIPDE</A> (page 17 in the manual) at intersections is critical.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p19a.gif" WIDTH=344 HEIGHT=238></CENTER>
<IMG SRC="p19b.gif" WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=140 ALIGN=left>
There are no guarantees that others see you.  Never count on "eye contact"
as a sign that a driver will yield.  Too often, a driver looks right at a
motorcyclist and still fails to "see" him.  The only eyes that you can count on
are your own.  If a car can enter your path, assume that it will.  Good riders are
always "looking for trouble" - not to get into it, but to stay out of it.
<P>
Increase your chances of being seen at intersections.  Ride with your headlight
on in a lane position that provides the best view of oncoming traffic.
Provide a space cushion around the motorcycle that permits you to take
evasive action.
<P>
As you approach the intersection, select a lane position to increase your
visibility to the driver.  Cover the clutch and both brakes to reduce reaction
time.
<P>
Reduce your speed.  After entering the intersection, move away from
oncoming vehicles preparing to turn.  Do not change speed or position
radically.  The driver might think that you are preparing to turn.
<A NAME="o"><H4>Blind Intersections</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p20a.gif" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=189 ALIGN=left>
If you approach a blind intersection, move to the portion of the lane that will bring
you into another driver's field of sight at the earliest possible moment.  In the picture, the rider has moved to the left portion of the lane - away from the parked
car - so the driver on the cross street can see him as soon as possible.
<P>
Remember, the key is to see as much as possible and remain visible to others while
protecting your space.<P>
<IMG SRC="p20b.gif" WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=169 ALIGN=right>
If you have a stop sign or stop line, stop there first.  Then edge forward
and stop again, just short of where the cross-traffic lane meets your lane.
From that position, lean your body forward and look around buildings,
parked cars, or bushes to see if anything is coming.  Just make sure your
front wheel stays out of the cross lane of travel while you're looking.
<A NAME="p"><H4>Passing Parked Cars</H4></A>
When passing parked cars, stay toward the left of your lane.  You can
avoid problems caused by doors opening, drivers getting out of cars, or
people stepping from between cars.  If oncoming traffic is present, it is
usually best to remain in the center-lane position to maximize your space
cushion.
<P>
A bigger problem can occur if the driver pulls away from the curb without
checking for traffic behind.  Even if he does look, he may fail to see you.  In
either event, the driver might cut into your path.  Slow down or change lanes
to make room for someone cutting in.<P>
<IMG SRC="p21a.gif" WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=136 ALIGN=left>
Cars making a sudden U-turn are the most dangerous.  They may cut you
off entirely, blocking the whole roadway and leaving you with no place to
go. Since you can't tell what a driver will do, get the driver's attention.
Sound your horn and continue with caution.
<A NAME="q"><H4>Parking at the Roadside</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p21b.gif" WIDTH=139 HEIGHT=164 ALIGN=right>
Angle your motorcycle to see in both directions without straining, or
having the cycle in the lane of travel. A clear view is particularly important
to turn across a lane of traffic.  When possible, back into the parking spot to
ride the motorcycle out into traffic.
<P>
<STRONG>
6. Making eye contact with other drivers:
<DD>A. is a good sign that they see you.
<DD>B. is important when approaching an intersection.
<DD>C. doesn't mean that the driver will yield.
<DD>D. decreases your chances of being involved in a collision.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="r"><H3>SEE AND BE SEEN</H3></A>
In collisions with motorcyclists, drivers often say that they never saw the
motorcycle.  From ahead or behind, a motorcycle's outline is much smaller
than a car's. Also, it's hard to see something you are not looking for, and
most drivers are not looking for motorcycles. More likely, they are looking
<STRONG><EM>through</EM></STRONG> the skinny, two-wheeled silhouette in search of cars that may pose
a problem to them.
<P>
Even if a driver does see you coming, you aren't necessarily safe.  Smaller
vehicles appear farther away, and seem to be traveling slower than they
actually are.  It is common for drivers to pull out in front of motorcyclists,
thinking they have plenty of time.  Too often, they are wrong.
<P>
However, you can do many things to make it easier for others to recognize
you and your cycle.
<A NAME="s"><H4>Clothing</H4></A>
Most collisions occur in broad daylight. Wear bright clothing to increase
your chances of being seen. Remember, your body is half of the visible
surface area of the rider/cycle unit.
<P>
Bright orange, yellow or green jackets or vests are your best bets for being
seen.  Your helmet can do more than protect you in a collision.  Brightly
colored helmets can help others see you.
<P>
Any bright color is better than drab or dark colors. Fluorescent clothing
(helmet and jacket or vest) is best for daytime riding. It absorbs light and
is not effective at night.
<P>
At night reflective gear should be worn.  Reflective material on the sides
of the helmet and vest will help drivers coming from the side spot you.
Reflective material can also be a big help for drivers coming toward you or
from behind.
<A NAME="t"><H4>Headlight</H4></A>
The best way to help others see your motorcycle is to keep the headlight
on - at all times.  Studies show that, during the day, a motorcycle with
lights on is twice as likely to be noticed.  Also, use of the high beam in
daylight increases the likelihood that oncoming drivers will see you.
<A NAME="u"><H4>Signals</H4></A>
The signals on a motorcycle are similar to those on a car. However, due
to a rider's added vulnerability, signals are even more important.  They tell
others what you plan to do.  Use them anytime you plan to change lanes.
Use them even when you think no one else is around.  It's the car you don't
see that's going to give you the most trouble.  Your signal lights also make
you easier to spot.  That's why it's a good idea to use your turn signals even
when what you plan to do is obvious.<P>
<IMG SRC="p23.gif" WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=232 ALIGN=right>
When you enter onto a freeway, drivers approaching from behind are more
likely to see your signal blinking and make room for you.
<P>
Turning your signal light on before each turn reduces confusion and frustration
for the traffic around you. Once you turn, make sure your signal is off or a driver
may pull directly into your path, thinking you plan to turn again.  Use your signals
at every turn so drivers can react accordingly.  Don't make them guess what you
intend to do.
<A NAME="v"><H4>Brake Light</H4></A>
Your motorcycle's brake light is usually not as noticeable as the brake
lights on a car - particularly when your taillight is on (It goes on with the
headlight). Help others notice you by flashing your brake light before you
slow down.  It is especially important to flash your brake light before:
<UL>
<LI>You slow more quickly than others might expect (turning off a high-speed highway).
<LI>You slow where others may not expect it (in the middle of a block or at an alley).
</UL>
If you are being followed closely, it's a good idea to flash your brake light
before you slow.  The tailgater may be watching you and not see something
ahead that will make you slow down.
<A NAME="w"><H4>Using Your Mirrors</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p24.gif" WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=175 ALIGN=right>
While it's most important to keep track of what's happening ahead, you can't afford to
ignore situations behind.  Traffic conditions change quickly.  Knowing what's going on
behind can help you make a safe decision about how to handle trouble ahead.
<P>
Frequent mirror checks should be part of your normal scanning routine.  Make a special
point of using your mirrors:
<UL>

Most motorcycles have rounded (convex) mirrors.  These provide a
wider view of the road behind than do flat mirrors.  They also make cars
seem farther away than they really are.  If you are not used to convex
mirrors, get familiar with them. <EM>(While you are stopped, pick out a parked car in your mirror.  Form a mental image of how far away it is.  Then, turn around and look at it to see how close you came.)</EM> Practice with your mirrors until you
become a good judge of distance.  Even then, allow extra distance before
you change lanes.
<H4>Head Checks</H4>
Checking your mirrors is not enough.  Motorcycles have "blind spots"
like cars.  Before you change lanes, turn your head, and look to the side to
spot a car about to pass you.

<A NAME="z"><H3>COLLISION AVOIDANCE</H3></A>
No matter how careful you are, there will be times when you find yourself
in a tight spot.  Your chances of getting out safely depend on your ability
to react quickly and properly.  Often, a collision occurs because a rider is
not prepared or skilled in collision-avoidance manuevers.
<P>
Know when and how to stop or swerve, two skills critical to avoiding a
collision.  It is not always desirable or possible to stop quickly to avoid an
obstacle.  Riders must also be able to swerve around an obstacle.
Determining the skill necessary to the situation is important as well.
<P>
Studies show that most <STRONG>collision-involved riders</STRONG>:
<UL>
<LI>Underbrake the front tire and overbrake the rear.
<LI>Do not separate braking from swerving.
</UL>
The following information offers some good advice.
<A NAME="aa"><H4>Quick Stops</H4></A>
To stop quickly, apply both brakes at the same time.  Don't be shy about
using the front brake, but don't "grab" at it, either.  Squeeze the brake lever
steadily and firmly.  Apply the front brake fully.  If the front wheel locks,
release the front brake.  At the same time, press down on the rear brake.  If
you accidentally lock the rear brake, keep it locked until you have completely
stopped.  Even with a locked rear wheel, you can control the cycle
on a straightaway if it is <EM>upright and going in a straight line</EM>.
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>Always use both brakes at the same time to stop.  The front brake can
provide 70% or more of the potential stopping power.</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="p26.gif" WIDTH=107 HEIGHT=87></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
If you must stop quickly <EM>while turning or riding a curve</EM>, it may not always
be possible to straighten the motorcycle and then stop.  If you must brake
while leaning, apply the brakes and reduce the throttle.  As you slow, you
can reduce your lean angle and apply more brake pressure until the
motorcycle is straight and maximum brake pressure is possible.  If you
"straighten" the handlebar in the last few feet of stopping, the motorcycle
should be straight up and in balance.
<A NAME="bb"><H4>Swerving or Turning Quickly</H4></A>
Sometimes you may not have enough room to stop, even if you use both
brakes properly.  An object might appear suddenly in your path.  Or the car
ahead might squeal to a stop.  The only way to avoid a collision may be to
turn quickly, swerve, or ride over the obstacle.
<P>
A swerve is two quick turns, one right after the first.  It is performed with
a small amount of hand pressure on the handgrip in the direction you wish
to go to get the motorcycle to lean quickly.  The sharper the turn(s), the more
the bike must lean.
<P>
Press on the inside of the handgrip in your intended direction of escape.
Then press on the inside of the opposite handgrip to return to your original
direction of travel once you have cleared the hazard.  To swerve to the left,
push the inside of the handgrips to the left, then push right to recover.  To
swerve to the right, push right, then push left to recover.  Keep your knees
snugly against the tank and your feet on the pegs.  Make your escape route
the target of your vision.
<P>
Try to stay in your own lane.  Change lanes only if you have enough time
to make sure there are no vehicles in the other lane.  You should be able to
squeeze by most obstacles without leaving your lane.

</TR>
</TABLE>
IF BRAKING IS REQUIRED, SEPARATE IT FROM SWERVING.  Brake
before or after -- never while swerving.
<A NAME="cc"><H4>Riding a Curve</H4></A>
A primary cause of single-vehicle collisions is motorcyclists running
wide in a curve or turn and colliding with the roadway or a fixed object.<P>
<IMG SRC="p28.gif" WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=252 ALIGN=left>
Every curve is different.  Be-alert to whether a curve remains
constant, gradually widens, gets tighter, or involves multiple turns.
<P>
Ride within your skill level and posted speed limits.
<P>
Your best path may not always follow the curve of the road.  Change lane
position depending on traffic and road conditions.  If no traffic is present
and your riding abilities are up to it, you may choose to start at the outside
of a curve to increase your line of sight and the effective radius of the turn.
As you turn, move toward the inside of the curve, and as you pass the
center, move to the outside to exit.
<P>
Another alternative is to move to the center of your lane before entering
a curve - and stay there until you exit.  This permits you to spot
approaching traffic as soon as possible.  You can also adjust for traffic
"crowding" the center line, or debris blocking part of your lane.
<P>
<STRONG>
8. The best way to stop quickly is to:
<DD>A. use the front brake only.
<DD>B. use the rear brake first.
<DD>C. throttle down and use the front brake.
<DD>D. use both brakes at the same time.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="dd"><H3>HANDLING DANGEROUS SURFACES</H3></A>
Your chance of falling or being involved in a collision increases whenever
you ride across:
<UL>
<LI>Uneven surfaces or obstacles.
<LI>Slippery surfaces.
<LI>Railroad tracks.
<LI>Grooves and gratings.
</UL>
<A NAME="ee"><H4>Uneven Surfaces and Obstacles</H4></A>
Watch for uneven surfaces such as bumps, broken pavement, potholes,
or small pieces of highway trash.
<P>
First, determine if it is possible to go over the obstacle.  Approach it at as
close to a 90 degree angle as possible.  Look where you want to go to control your
path of travel.  If you have to ride over the obstacle, you should:
<UL>
<LI>Slow down to reduce the jolt if time permits.
<LI>Make sure the motorcycle is straight up.
<LI>Rise slightly off the seat with your weight on the footpegs to absorb the
shock with your knees and elbows.
</UL>
Rising off the seat will reduce your chances of being thrown off the bike.
However, controlling the throttle can be somewhat tricky.  Practice this in
an area such as an empty parking lot away from traffic.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p29.gif" WIDTH=305 HEIGHT=206></CENTER>
If you ride over an object on the street, pull off the road and check your
tires and rims for damage before riding any farther.
<A NAME="ff"><H4>Slippery Surfaces</H4></A>
Motorcycles handle better when ridden on surfaces that permit good
traction.  Surfaces that provide poor traction include:
<UL>
<LI>Wet pavement, particularly just after it starts to rain and before surface
oil washes to the side of the road.
<LI>Gravel roads, or where sand and gravel collect.
<LI>Mud, snow, and ice.
<LI>Lane markings, steel plates and manhole covers, especially when wet.
</UL>
To ride safely on slippery surfaces:<P>
<STRONG><EM>Reduce Speed</EM></STRONG> --- Slow down before
you get to a slippery surface to lessen your chances of skidding when stopping
or turning.  Your motorcycle needs more distance to stop.  It is particularly
important to reduce speed before entering wet curves.
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Avoid Sudden Moves</EM></STRONG> --- Any sudden
change in speed or direction can cause a skid.  Be as smooth as possible
when you speed up, shift gears, turn or brake.
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Use Both Brakes</EM></STRONG> --- The front brake
is more effective even on a slippery surface.  Squeeze the brake lever
gradually to avoid locking the front wheel.
<UL>
<LI>The center of a lane can be hazardous when wet.  When it starts to rain,
ride in the tire tracks left by cars.  Often, the left tire track will be the best
position, depending on traffic and other road conditions as well.
<LI>Watch for oil spots when you put your foot down to stop or park. You
may slip and fall.
<LI>Dirt and gravel collect along the sides of the road - especially on curves
and ramps leading to and from highways.  Stay away from the edge of
the road, particularly when making sharp turns and getting on or off
freeways at high speeds.
<LI>Rain dries and snow melts faster on some sections of a road than on
others.  Patches of ice tend to crop up in low or shaded areas and on
bridges and overpasses.  Wet surfaces or wet leaves are just as slippery.
Ride on the least slippery portion of the lane.
</UL>
Cautious riders steer clear of roads covered with ice or snow.  If you can't
avoid a slippery surface, keep your bike straight up and proceed as <EM>slowly</EM>
as possible.  If you encounter a large surface so slippery that you must coast,
or travel at a walking pace, consider letting your feet skim along the surface.
If the bike starts to fall, you can catch yourself.  Be sure to keep off the brakes.
If possible, squeeze the clutch and coast.  Attempting this maneuver at
anything other than the slowest of speeds could prove hazardous.
<A NAME="gg"><H4>Railroad Tracks, Trolley Tracks and Pavement Seams</H4></A>
<IMG SRC="p31a.gif" WIDTH=211 HEIGHT=136 ALIGN=left>
Usually it is safer to ride straight within your lane to
cross tracks.  Turning to take tracks head-on (at a 90
degree angle) can be more dangerous - your path may carry
you into another lane of traffic.<P>
 <IMG SRC="p31b.gif" WIDTH=159 HEIGHT=133 ALIGN=right>
Move far enough away from tracks, ruts, or pavement seams that run
parallel to your course to cross at an angle of at least 45 degrees. 
Then, make a quick, sharp turn.  Edging across could catch
your tires and throw you off balance.
<H4>Grooves and Gratings</H4>
<IMG SRC="p31c.gif" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=144 ALIGN=left>
<P>
<BR>
Riding over rain grooves or bridge gratings will cause
a motorcycle to weave.  The uneasy, wandering feeling
is generally not hazardous. Relax, maintain speed and
ride straight across.  Crossing at an angle forces riders
to zigzag to stay in the lane. The zigzag is far more hazardous
than the wandering feeling.
<P>
<BR>

<STRONG>
9. When it starts to rain it is usually best to:
<DD>A. ride in the center of the lane.
<DD>B. pull off to the side until the rain stops.
<DD>C. ride in the tire tracks left by cars.
<DD>D. increase your speed.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="hh"><H3>MECHANICAL PROBLEMS</H3></A>You can find yourself in an emergency the moment something goes
wrong with your motorcycle.  In dealing with any mechanical problem, take
into account the road and traffic conditions you face.  Here are some
guidelines that can help you handle mechanical problems safely.
<A NAME="ii"><H4>Tire Failure</H4></A>
You will seldom hear a tire go flat.  If the cycle starts handling differently,
it may be a tire failure.  This can be dangerous.  You must be able to tell from
the way the cycle reacts.  If one of your tires suddenly loses air, react quickly
to keep your balance.  Pull off and check the tires.
<P>
If the front tire goes flat, the steering will feel "heavy." A front-wheel flat
is particularly hazardous because it affects your steering.  You have to steer
well to keep your balance.
<P>
If the rear tire goes flat, the back of the motorcycle will jerk from side to
side.
<P>
If either tire goes flat while riding:
<UL>
<LI>Hold the handlegrips firmly and keep a straight course.
<LI>Gradually apply the brake of the tire that isn't flat, if you are sure which
one it is.
<LI>When the motorcycle slows, edge to the side of the road and stop.
</UL>
<A NAME="jj"><H4>Stuck Throttle</H4></A>
Twist the throttle back and forth several times.  If the throttle cable is
stuck, this may free it.  If the throttle stays stuck immediately operate the
engine cut-off switch and pull in the clutch at the same time.  This will
remove power from the rear wheel, though engine noise may not
immediately decline.  Once the motorcycle is "under control," pull off and stop.
<P>
After you have stopped, check the throttle cable carefully to find the
source of the trouble.  Make certain the throttle works freely before you start
to ride again.
<A NAME="kk"><H4>Wobble</H4></A>
A "wobble" occurs when the front wheel and handlebars suddenly start
to shake from side to side at any speed.  Most wobbles can be traced to
improper loading, unsuitable accessories, or incorrect tire pressure.  If you
are carrying a heavy load, lighten it.  If you can't, shift it.  Center the weight
lower and farther forward on the cycle.  Make sure tire pressure, spring
preload, air shocks, and dampers are at the settings recommended for that
much weight.  Make sure windshields and fairings are mounted properly.
<P>
Check for poorly adjusted steering; worn steering parts; a front wheel
that is bent, misaligned, or out of balance; loose wheel bearings or spokes;
and swingarm bearings.  If none of these are determined to be the cause,
have the motorcycle checked out thoroughly by a qualified professional.
<P>
Trying to "accelerate out of a wobble" will only make the cycle more
unstable.  Instead:
<UL>
<LI>Grip the handlebars firmly, but don't fight the wobble.
<LI>Close the throttle gradually to slow the motorcycle.  Do not apply the
brakes; braking could make the wobble worse.
<LI>Move your weight as far forward and down as possible.
<LI>Pull off the road as soon as you can to fix the problem.
</UL>
<A NAME="ll"><H4>Chain Problems</H4></A>
A chain that slips or breaks while you're riding could lock the rear wheel
and cause your cycle to skid.  Chain slippage or breakage can be avoided
by proper maintenance.
<P>
<STRONG><EM>Slippage</EM></STRONG> --- If the chain slips when
you try to speed up quickly or ride uphill, pull off the road.  Check the chain
and sprockets.  Tightening the chain may help. If the problem is a worn or
stretched chain or worn or bent sprockets, replace the chain, the sprockets,
or both before riding again.
<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Breakage</EM></STRONG> --- You'll notice an instant
loss of power to the rear wheel.  Close the throttle and brake to a stop.
<A NAME="mm"><H4>Engine Seizure</H4></A>
When the engine "locks" or "freezes" it is usually low on oil.  The engine's
moving parts can't move smoothly against each other, and the engine
overheats.  The first sign may be a loss of engine power or a change in the
engine's sound.  Squeeze the clutch lever to disengage the engine from the
rear wheel.  Pull off the road and stop.  Check the oil.  If needed, oil should
be added as soon as possible or the engine will seize.  When this happens,
the effect is the same as a locked rear wheel.  Let the engine cool before
restarting.
<P>
<STRONG>
10.  If your motorcycle starts to wobble:
<DD>A. accelerate out of the wobble.
<DD>B. use the brakes gradually.
<DD>C. grip the handlebars firmly and close the throttle.
<DD>D. downshift.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="nn"><H3>ANIMALS</H3></A>
Naturally, you should do everything you safely can to avoid hitting an
animal.  If you are in traffic, however, remain in your lane.  Hitting
something small is less dangerous to you than hitting something big - like
a car.
<P>
Motorcycles seem to attract dogs.  If you are chased, shift down and
approach the animal slowly.  As you approach it, speed up and leave the
animal behind.  Don't kick at an animal.  Keep control of your motorcycle,
and look to where you want to go.
<H3>FLYING OBJECTS</H3>
From time to time riders are struck by insects, cigarettes thrown from
cars, or pebbles kicked up by the tires of the vehicle ahead.  If you are
wearing face protection, it might get smeared or cracked, making it difficult
to see.  Without face protection, an object could hit you in the eye, face, or
mouth.  Whatever happens, keep your eyes on the road and your hands on
the handlebars.  When safe, pull off the road and repair the damage.
<A NAME="oo"><H3>GETTING OFF THE ROAD</H3></A>
If you need to leave the road to check the motorcycle (or just to rest for
a while), be sure you:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Check the roadside</EM></STRONG> --- Make
sure the surface of the roadside is firm enough to ride on.  If it is soft grass,
loose sand, or if you're just not sure about it, slow way down before you turn onto it.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Signal</EM></STRONG> --- Drivers behind might not
expect you to slow down. Give a clear signal that you will be slowing down
and changing direction.  Check your mirror and make a head check before
you take any action.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Pull off the road</EM></STRONG> --- Get as far off the
road as you can. It can be very hard to spot a motorcycle by the side of the road.
You don't want someone else pulling off at the same place you are.

<A NAME="qq"><H4>Equipment</H4></A>
To carry passengers safely:
<UL>
<LI>Equip and adjust your motorcycle to carry passengers.
<LI>Instruct the passenger before you start.
<LI>Adjust your riding technique for the added weight.
</UL>
Equipment should include:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>A proper seat</EM></STRONG> --- large enough to
hold both of you without crowding. You should not sit any farther forward
than you usually do.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Footpegs</EM></STRONG> --- for the passenger.
A firm footing prevents your passenger from falling off and pulling you off, too.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Protective equipment</EM></STRONG> --- the

<UL>
<LI>Get on the motorcycle after you have started the engine.
<LI>Sit as far forward as possible without crowding you.
<LI>Hold firmly to your waist, hips, or belt.
<LI>Keep both feet on the pegs, even when stopped.
<LI>Keep legs away from the muffler(s).
<LI>Stay directly behind you, leaning as you lean.
<LI>Avoid unnecessary talk or motion.

<LI>Start slowing earlier as you approach a stop.
<LI>Open up a larger cushion of space ahead and to the sides.
<LI>Wait for larger gaps to cross, enter, or merge in traffic.

Warn your passenger of special conditions - when you will pull out, stop
quickly, turn sharply, or ride over a bump.  Turn your head slightly to make
yourself understood, but keep your eyes on the road ahead.
<A NAME="tt"><H4>Carrying Loads</H4></A>
Most motorcycles are not designed to carry much cargo.  Small loads can
be carried safely if positioned and fastened properly.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Keep the Load Low</EM></STRONG> --- Fasten
loads to the seat, or put them in saddle bags.  Piling loads against a
sissybar or frame on the back of the seat raises the cycle's center of gravity
and disturbs its balance.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Keep the Load Forward</EM></STRONG> --- Place
the load over, or in front of, the rear axle.  Tankbags keep loads forward, but
use caution when loading hard or sharp objects.  Mounting loads behind the
rear axle can affect how the cycle turns and brakes.  It can also cause a wobble.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Distribute the Load Evenly</EM></STRONG> --- Load
saddlebags with about the same weight.  An uneven load can cause the
motorcycle to drift to one side.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Secure the Load</EM></STRONG> --- Fasten the
load securely with elastic cords (bungee cords). A tight load won't catch in
the wheel or chain, causing it to lock up and skid.  Rope tends to stretch and
knots come loose, permitting the load to shift or fall.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Check the Load</EM></STRONG> --- Stop and
check the load every so often to sure it has not worked loose or moved.

and open up room for the next rider.

Some people suggest that the leader should move to the right side after
passing a vehicle.  This is not a good idea.  It encourages the second rider
to pass and cut back in before there is a large enough space cushion in front
of the passed vehicle.  It's simpler and safer to wait until there is enough
room ahead of the passed vehicle to allow each rider to move into the same
position held before the pass.

<H2>BEING IN SHAPE TO RIDE</H2>
Riding a motorcycle is a demanding and complex task.  Skilled riders pay
attention to the riding environment and to operating the motorcycle,
identifying potential hazards, making good judgments, and executing
decisions quickly and skillfully.  Your ability to perform and respond to
changing road and traffic conditions is influenced by how fit and alert you
are.  Alcohol and other drugs, more than any other factor, degrade your
ability to think clearly and to ride safely.  As little as one drink can have a
significant effect on your performance.
<P>
Let's look at the risks involved in riding after drinking or using drugs.
What to do to protect yourself and your fellow riders is also examined.
<A NAME="b"><H3>WHY THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT</H3></A>
Alcohol is a major contributor to motorcycle collisions, particularly fatal
collisions.  Studies show that 40% to 45% of all riders killed in motorcycle
crashes had been drinking.  Only one-third of those riders had a blood
alcohol concentration above legal limits.  The rest had only a few drinks in
their systems - enough to impair riding skills.  In the past, drug levels have
been harder to distinguish or have not been separated from drinking
violations for the traffic records.  But riding "under the influence" of either
alcohol or drugs poses physical and legal hazards for every rider.
<P>
Drinking and drug use is as big a problem among motorcyclists as it is
among automobile drivers.  Motorcyclists, however, are more likely to be
killed or severely injured in a collision.  Injuries occur in 90% of motorcycle
collisions and 33% of automobile collisions that involve abuse of substances. 
On a yearly basis, 2,500 motorcyclists are killed and about 50,000
seriously injured in this same type of collision.  These statistics are too
overwhelming to ignore.
<P>
By becoming knowledgeable about the effects of alcohol and other drugs
you will see that riding and substance abuse don't mix.  Take positive steps
to protect yourself and prevent others from injuring themselves.
<A NAME="c"><H3>ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS IN MOTORCYCLE OPERATION</H3></A>
No one is immune to the effects of alcohol or drugs.  Friends may brag
about their ability to hold their liquor or perform better on drugs, but
alcohol or drugs make them less able to think clearly and perform physical
tasks skillfully.  Judgment and the decision-making processes needed for
vehicle operation are affected long before legal limitations are reached.
<P>
Many over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drugs have side effects
that increase the risk of riding.  It is difficult to accurately measure the
involvement of particular drugs in motorcycle collisions.  But we do know
what effects various drugs have on the process involved in riding a
motorcycle.  We also know that the combined effects of alcohol and other
drugs are more dangerous than either is alone.
<A NAME="d"><H3>ALCOHOL IN THE BODY</H3></A>
Alcohol enters the bloodstream quickly.  Unlike most foods and beverages,
it does not need to be digested.  Within minutes after being consumed,
it reaches the brain and begins to affect the drinker.  The major effect alcohol
has is to slow down and impair bodily functions - both mental and
physical.  Whatever you do, you do less well after consuming alcohol.
<A NAME="e"><H4>Blood Alcohol Concentration</H4></A>
The more alcohol in your blood, the greater the degree of impairment.
Your Blood Alcohol Concentration or BAC is the amount of alcohol in
relation to other fluids in the body.  Generally, alcohol can be eliminated in
the body at the rate of almost one drink per hour.  But a variety of other
factors may also influence the level of alcohol retained.
<P>
Three factors play a major part in determining BAC:
<UL>
<LI>The amount of alcohol you consume.
<LI>The number of hours you have been drinking.
<LI>Your body weight.
</UL>
But other factors contribute to the way alcohol affects your system.  Your
sex, physical condition and food intake are just a few that may cause your
BAC level to be even higher.  But the full effects of these are not completely
known.  Alcohol may still accumulate in your body <STRONG>even if you are
drinking at a rate of one drink per hour</STRONG>.  Abilities and judgment can be
affected by that one drink.
<P> 
The typical drink contains six-tenths of an ounce of alcohol.  A 12-ounce
can of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, or a shot of liquor all contain the same
amount of alcohol.  BAC is determined in part by how much alcohol you
have consumed.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="p41.gif" WIDTH=363 HEIGHT=177></CENTER>
The faster you drink, the more alcohol accumulates in your body.  At
most, the body can only burn off one drink in an hour.  If you drink two
drinks in an hour, at the end of that hour, at least one drink will remain in
your bloodstream.
<P>
Without taking into account any of the other factors, the formula below
illustrates the <U>LEAST</U> amount of drinks remaining in the bloodstream:
<P>
Drinks consumed - hours = drinks left
<P>
A person drinking
<UL>
<LI>8 drinks in 4 hours would have at least
4 drinks remaining in their system.
<LI>7 drinks in 3 hours would have at least
 4 drinks remaining in their system.
</UL>
There are times when a larger person may not accumulate as high a
concentration of alcohol for each drink consumed.  They have more blood
and other bodily fluids.  But because of individual differences it is better not
to take the chance that abilities and judgment have not been affected.
Whether or not you are legally intoxicated is not the real issue.  Impairment
of judgement and skills begins well below the legal limit.
<A NAME="f"><H3>ALCOHOL AND THE LAW</H3></A>
In most states, a person with a BAC of .10% or above is considered
intoxicated; in others the legal limit is .08% or .05%. It doesn't matter how
sober you may look or act.  The breath or urine test is what usually
determines whether you are riding legally or illegally.
<P>
Your chances of being stopped for riding under the influence of alcohol
are increasing.  Law enforcement is being stepped up across the country in
response to the senseless deaths and injuries caused by drinking drivers
and riders.
<A NAME="g"><H4>Consequences of Conviction</H4></A>
Years ago, first offenders had a good chance of getting off with a small
fine and participation in alcohol-abuse classes.  Today the laws of most
states impose stiff penalties on drinking operators.  And those penalties are
mandatory, meaning that judges must impose them.
<P>
If you are convicted of riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you
may receive any of the following penalties:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>License Suspension</EM></STRONG> --- Mandatory
suspension for conviction, arrest or refusal to submit to a breath test.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Fines</EM></STRONG> --- Severe fines are another
aspect of a conviction usually levied with a license suspension.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Community Service</EM></STRONG> --- Performing
tasks such as picking up litter along the highway, washing cars in the motor-vehicle
pool, or working at an emergency ward.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Costs</EM></STRONG> --- Additional lawyer's fees to
pay; lost work time spent in court or alcohol-education programs; public transportation
costs (while your license is suspended); and the added psychological costs of being
tagged a "drunk driver."
</UL>
<A NAME="h"><H3>MINIMIZE THE RISKS</H3></A>
Your ability to judge how well you are riding is affected first.  Although
you may be performing more and more poorly, you think you are doing
better and better.  The result is that you ride confidently, taking greater and
greater risks.  Minimize the risks of drinking and riding by taking steps
before you drink.  Control your drinking or control your riding.
<A NAME="i"><H4>Control Drinking</H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>DON'T DRINK --- Once you start, your resistance becomes weaker.
</UL>
Setting a limit or pacing yourself are poor alternatives at best.  Your ability
to exercise good judgment is one of the first things affected by alcohol.  Even
if you have tried to drink in moderation, you may not realize to what extent
your skills have suffered from alcohol's fatiguing effects.
<A NAME="j"><H4>Control Riding</H4></A>
If you haven't controlled your drinking, you must control your riding.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Leave the bike home</EM></STRONG> --- so you 
won't be tempted to ride.  Arrange another way to get home.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Wait</EM></STRONG> --- If you exceed your limit,
wait until your system eliminates the alcohol and its fatiguing effects.
</UL>
<A NAME="k">
People who have had too much to drink are unable to make a responsible
decision.  It is up to others to step in and keep them from taking too great
a risk.  No one wants to do this - it's uncomfortable, embarrassing and
thankless.  You are rarely thanked for your efforts at the time.  But the
alternatives are often worse.</A>
<P>
There are several ways to keep friends from hurting themselves:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Arrange a safe ride</EM></STRONG> --- Provide
alternative ways for them to get home.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Slow the pace of drinking</EM></STRONG> --- Involve
them in other activities.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Keep them there</EM></STRONG> --- Use any excuse
to keep them from getting on their bike.  Serve them food and coffee to pass the
time.  Explain your concerns for their risks of getting arrested or hurt, or hurting
someone else.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Keep the bike there</EM></STRONG> --- If you can't control
the rider, control the bike. Take the keys or temporarily disable the bike (e.g., loosen
or switch the plug leads enough so they won't fire).
</UL>
It helps to enlist support from others when you decide to step in.  The
more people on your side, the easier it is to be firm and the harder it is for
the rider to resist.  While you may not be thanked at the time, you will never
have to say, "If only I had..."
<P>
<STRONG>
14.   If you wait an hour for each drink before riding:
<DD>A.  you cannot be arrested for drinking and riding.
<DD>B.  your riding skills will not be affected.
<DD>C.  side effects from the drinking may still remain.
<DD>D.  you will be okay as long as you ride slowly.
</STRONG>
<A NAME="l"><H3>FATIGUE</H3></A>
Riding a motorcycle is more tiring than driving a car.  On a long trip, you'll
tire sooner than you would in a car.  Avoid riding when tired.  Fatigue can
affect your control of the cycle.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG><EM>Protect yourself from the elements</EM>
</STRONG> --- Wind, cold, and rain make you tire quickly.  Dress warmly.  A
windshield is worth its cost if you plan to ride long distances.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Limit your distance</EM></STRONG> --- Experienced
riders seldom try to ride more than about six hours a day.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Take frequent rest breaks</EM></STRONG> --- Stop, and
get off the cycle at least every two hours.
<LI><STRONG><EM>Don't drink or use drugs</EM></STRONG> --- Artificial
stimulants often result in extreme fatigue or depression when they start to wear off.
Riders are unable to concentrate on the task at hand.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
15.   To avoid fatigue, you should ride no more than:
<DD>A.  2 hours a day.
<DD>B.  4 hours a day.
<DD>C.  6 hours a day.
<DD>D.  10 hours a day.

<H2>EARNING YOUR LICENSE</H2>
Safe riding requires knowledge and skill.  Licensing tests are the best
measurement of the skills necessary to operate safely in traffic.  Assessing
your own skills is not enough.  People often overestimate their own abilities.
It's even harder for friends and relatives to be totally honest about your
skills.  Licensing exams are designed to be scored more objectively.
<P>
To earn your license, you must pass a knowledge test and an on-cycle skill
test.  Knowledge test questions are based on information, practices, and
ideas from this manual.  They require that you know and understand road
rules and safe riding practices.  An on-cycle skill test will either be
conducted in an actual traffic environment or in a controlled, off-street area.
<P>
<A NAME="a"><H3>KNOWLEDGE TEST - Sample Questions</H3></A>
Answers are printed at the bottom of the next page.
<P>
1. It is MOST important to flash your brake light when:
<DD>A. someone is following too closely.
<DD>B. you will be slowing suddenly.
<DD>C. there is a stop sign ahead.
<DD>D. your signals are not working.
<P>
2. The FRONT brake supplies how much of the potential stopping power?
<DD>A. About one-quarter.
<DD>B. About one-half.
<DD>C. About three-quarters.
<DD>D. All of the stopping power.
<P>
3. To swerve correctly:
<DD>A. shift your weight quickly.
<DD>B. turn the handlebars quickly.
<DD>C. push the handgrip in the direction of the turn.
<DD>D. push the handgrip in the opposite direction of the turn.
<P>
4. If a tire goes flat while riding, it is usually best to:
<DD>A. hold the handlegrips firmly and stay off the brakes.
<DD>B. shift your weight toward the good wheel and brake.
<DD>C. brake on the good wheel and steer to the right.
<DD>D. use both brakes and stop quickly.
<P>
<IMG SRC="p46.gif" WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=163 ALIGN=right>
5. The car is waiting to enter the intersection.  It is best to:
<DD>A.  make eye contact with the driver.
<DD>B.  reduce speed and be ready to react.
<DD>C.  maintain speed and position.
<DD>D.  maintain speed and move right.
<A NAME="b"><H3>ON-CYCLE TEST</H3></A>
Basic vehicle control and collision-avoidance skills are included in
on-cycle tests to determine your ability to handle normal and hazardous traffic
situations.  For example, you may be tested for your ability to:
<UL>
<LI>Know your motorcycle and your riding limits.
<LI>Accelerate, brake, and turn safely.
<LI>See, be seen and communicate with others.
<LI>Adjust speed and position to the traffic situation.
<LI>Stop, turn and swerve quickly.
<LI>Make critical decisions and carry them out.
</UL>
Examiners may score on factors related to safety such as:
<UL>
<LI>Selecting safe speeds to perform maneuvers.
<LI>Choosing the correct path and staying within boundaries.
<LI>Completing normal and quick stops.
<LI>Completing normal and quick turns, or swerves.
</UL>
The test will stop immediately if you cannot locate or correctly operate
the controls, fall, drop the motorcycle, commit an unsafe act or refuse
to perform any required maneuver.

The Motorcycle Safety Foundation's purpose is improving the safety of motorcyclists on the nation's streets and highways.  In an attempt to reduce motorcycle accidents and injuries, the Foundation has programs in rider education, licensing improvement, public information and statistics.  These programs are designed for both motorcyclists and motorists.  A national,
non-profit organization, MSF is sponsored by five U.S. motorcycle distributors: Honda,Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki and BMW.
<P>
The information contained in this publication is offered for the benefit of those who have an interest in riding motorcycles.  The information has been compiled from publications, interviews and observations of individuals and organizations familiar with the use of motorcycles, accessories, and training.  Because there are many differences in product design, riding styles, Federal, State and local laws, there may be organizations and individuals who hold differing opinions.  Consult your local regulatory agencies for information concerning the operation of motorcycles in your area.  Although the Motorcycle Safety Foundation will continue to research, field test and publish responsible viewpoints on the subject, it disclaims any liability for the views expressed herein.

<p><font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Seatbelts:</b></font> Each person in the front seat of a car built after 1972 must have a seatbelt on and it must be properly fastened.  That means that every time you ride in a car, you must wear your seat belt.  Seatbelts reduce fatalities by 45 to 55 percent.  That means if you are in an accident, you are 50 percent safer with your seatbelt on then if you weren't wearing one.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><u><b>Child Safety Seats:</u></b></font> Required by Arizona law; if you have a child who is younger than four years of age or weighs less than 40 pounds, you must put the child in a safety seat.  Breaking this law can result in a fine of $50.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> The proper way to cross the street:</b></font> Before you cross the street, you should always stop at the corner and look for cars.  Crosswalks at intersections have crossing lights.  The green person walking means go and the red hand means stop.  If there is a car coming, wait until the car passes or comes to a complete stop, before you step off the curb.  Sometimes drivers don't see children on the sidewalk.  Once the driver stops, wait until you see the crosswalk signal that shows that its okay to cross the street.  If there is no light or crosswalk signal at the corner, make sure you wait until the car stops and the driver waves for you to cross.  Then you know the driver has seen you.  You should always walk inside the white lines of the crosswalk until you reach the other side of the street.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Turn Signals:</b></font> Other drivers expect you to keep doing what you're doing.  Signaling them lets them know you are planning to do something different.  This gives them time to react to your move.  The law requires you to signal 100 feet before you turn.  You should always signal before you: Change lanes, turn at an intersection or into a driveway, enter or leave a freeway.  Also, when you are going to cross a street, look for turn signals on approaching cars.  Cars can turn right on red or green lights.  That means a car might try to turn while you are trying to cross the street.  There are hand signals for people who are on bikes. <p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Areas Off Limits:</b></font> Storm drains, locked fences, medians, and construction areas.  These areas are not playgrounds and can be very dangerous for children.  There could be deep holes you might fall into or loose dirt.  The large construction trucks and tractors can not see you since they are so tall.  It is also unsafe for children, adults, and animals to ride in the back of a pick-up truck.  If the truck comes to a quick stop or is involved in an accident, the person or animal in the back of the truck can be thrown from the vehicle.  Animals may jump out of the vehicle while it is in motion.  These areas are all extremely dangerous.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Graffitti:</b></font> Graffiti is against the law.  Any person who recklessly defaces someone else's property is guilty of a crime. This includes more than just using spray paint.  It includes any destruction of someone else's property. Punishment could include a fine, going to jail, or both.  <br>
Here's a list of some possible punishments:<br>
<ol><li>A minimum two days juvenile detention or county jail time
<li> 80 hours of community service
<li>Full victim restitution  (pay for everything you damaged)
<li> Mandatory counseling for parents and juvenielle offenders at the parent's expense
<li> Fines of up to $10,000 to the parents of juvenile offenders
</ol><p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> Dust Storms:</b></font> Dust storms are common in Arizona and can sometimes reduce visability to zero.  If you run into a severe dust storm, reduce the speed of your vehicle immediately and drive carefully off the highway.  Turn off your vehicle's lights to ensure other cars do not follow you off the road and hit your vehicle.  Wait until the dust storm had passed before getting back on the highway.  If you are walking or riding your bike, get inside quickly or seek shelter.  Dust storms have a lot of flying debris that could be dangerous.</u></b></font><p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> Snow Safety/Black Ice:</b></font> Turn on your headlights to see and be seen.  The same rules apply to bicyclists as well as motorists.  Apply the brakes gently, increasing the applied pressure as you feel the tires grip the road.  Do not apply the brakes to the point where the wheels lock.  If the wheels lock, ease off the brakes slightly, but do not release them completely.  Then apply the brakes and ease off again, repeating the process.<br>
<ul><li>Before you begin driving, clear snow and ice from all the car windows and lights.  Clear ice from all bike reflectors.
<li> Equip your car with snow tires or chains to help prevent skidding and reduce stopping distances.
<li> Drive gently, do not change speed or direction suddenly.
<li>Slow down before stopping or turning.  Driving on packed snow is much like driving on ice.
<li> Watch for ice on bridges and in shady areas.  Bridge surfaces freeze before other road surfaces.  
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Rain:</b></font> Slow down to increase the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you to at least four seconds, or double the normal distance.  Be extra careful driving during the first half hour after rain begins.  Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water and make the road slippery.  In heavy rain, your tires can lose all contact with the road. This is called hydroplaning. Deflated, worn, or bald tires can lose all contact with the road at much lower speeds.  The best way to prevent hydroplaning is to slow down.  If your car does hydroplane, take your foot off the accelerator, do not brake, avoid steering changes if possible, and hold the steering wheel firmly until your tires grip the road again.  Bicycles as well as cars can hydroplane.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Bikes, Skateboards, In-line skates and Motor scooters:</b></font>  Make sure to always wear a helmet.  Do not ride on the highway or in traffic.  Wear bright colored clothes to help motorists see you better.  Wear all the required safety gear such as elbow pads and knee pads.  Always signal your movements for motorists.<p>

<B><CENTER> Special Edition - October, 1996</CENTER></B>

<B><CENTER><H5>Strictly Personnel in Eleventh Year of Publication</H5></CENTER></B>
<P>
<STRONG>In April 1985, the first edition of Strictly Personnel rolled
off the presses and was distributed as a payroll stuffer to all
ADOT employees.</STRONG> 
<P>
<B>&quot;This is the first in what we hope will be a long series
of informative newsletters on developments in the personnel management
area.  It is our intent to include a copy with each employee's
paycheck every other pay period, so that all employees are better
informed.  If there is a particular subject you would like to
see covered which would be of benefit to a number of employees,
please bring it to my attention.  We will also plan for a short
question and answer column, so forward your questions to my attention.
 Be sure to include your name and address, so that a personal
answer may be provided in case space does not allow for printing
your question.</B>
<P>
<B>Our purpose is for better communication, so let us know if
you feel such a newsletter is of value, how we can improve it,
or whether it is of no value and should be discontinued.  Your
comments are vital, as we firmly believe that a better informed
employee is a better employee.&quot;</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B> Loren W. Garber</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B> Personnel Manager</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>This special edition is dedicated to Mr. Garber whose leadership,
dedication, professionalism, foresight, and sincerity set the
stage with the first edition addressing six subjects, as a publication
sought after by all other agencies as well as ADOT.  This is still
true, some eleven years later and several thousand subjects shared
with all agencies throughout the state.</B>
<P>
<B>The Personnel Story in 1985 portrayed a small unit of some
outstanding employees with no automation, one main telephone number,
no fax, three doors, and a four-part-paper personnel form (AZ001)
pronounced, &quot;AHZOOIE&quot;, all cramped into a space that
was  previously a hallway.  Customers could be found wandering
through looking for the cafeteria. Only two employees remain from
that era, Carolee Arnevik and Carmen Candelaria.  Others who were
part of this fine team are: Esther Lewis, Jim Bentley, Norman
Gallion, Rose Vega, Beverly Hunter, Bob Ball, June Fink, Carol
Nish, Ana Heredia, Bonnie McMillian and Arlene Ackerman.  </B>
<P>
<B>&quot;Communication&quot; was a word that everyone knew, but
had some degree of difficulty in exercising except among each
other.  Dilbert could have published several books on this unit.
 Yet, everyone was paid, data was reported to ADOA, discipline
was administered and pins were given in recognition of milestones
in state service.  What else could you ask for!  No one knew of
what was to come, with the verification of citizenship (I-9),
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA), CDL Drug and Alcohol Testing, Telecommuting, Flex hours,
4 tens, 9 eighty, Donated Annual Leave, Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA), Fitness for Duty, Light Duty or even a lap top computer.
 Up to that point we thought &quot;Lap Top&quot; was a large dog.</B>
<P>
<B>In early 1986, we lost Employee Assistance, Safety and Training
as the reporting relationship moved from the Personnel Manager
to the Director's office.</B>
<P>
<B>Then WYLBUR (New folks thought that was a person) was most
popular at ADOT and Personnel decided to build their own personnel
system to eliminate the paper flow and the many errors that had
to be manually identified before actions could be sent to ADOA.
 In fact, there were so many changes on the &quot;AHZOOIE,&quot;
that we were known as the &quot;Band Aid&quot; crew.  During 1986
we (with the help of some of the all time greats in what was then
called, Information Support Group) created the Electronic AZ001
that allowed us to process personnel and payroll actions overnight.
 This was to be the forerunner for the HRMS (Human Resources Management
System) that we all enjoy.  </B>
<P>
<B>Jim Creedon, Deputy Director and later interim Director of
ADOT, formed a Team of employees dubbed, &quot;CARE&quot; or,
Care and Recognition of Employees.  Anyone from anyplace could
send in anything and the team would work on the ideas and provide
comments every other week.  We resolved more issues in a short
period of time than have been addressed since.</B>
<P>
<B>In 1992, Charlie Miller decided to return to his &quot;roots&quot;
in West Virginia where he still toils over the Highway System.
 Our new Director, &quot;Chuck&quot; Cowan, introduced us to &quot;Quality&quot;
and we began our journey into the future, seeking to become the
Model of efficient, effective, responsive government, the preferred
partner of business and industry, the employer of choice, attracting
and retaining the best and brightest, with continuous improvement
our way of life!  We learned about teams, measurements, facilitating,
visions, mission statements, mutually agreed upon requirements,
charts and graphs, partnering and &quot;Meetings.&quot;</B>
<P>
<B>In 1993, Coach Larry Bonine joined us and new Quality Life
accelerated throughout the agency from top to bottom.  His energy
is not unlike a nuclear reactor as he lives, breathes and teaches
anyone who will listen, that improvement is always within reach,
that we can always improve, that the only limitation is self imposed.
 Mary Peters became our Deputy Director and a champion of everyone.
The journey continues!</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>HUMAN RESOURCES MISSION STATEMENT</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>To deliver a professional personnel service and technical assistance
in response to specific needs of ADOT management and employees,
giving recognition to the unique variances of each division and
free choice of management style, within the uniform State Service
Merit System.</B>

effective within the framework.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES:</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>LEADERSHIP:</B>
<P>
<B>A responsibility to be sensitive and responsive to the needs
of the ADOT and its' employees while setting the example for others
to emulate.  Demonstrate leadership through innovative methods
that are consistent with our commitment to excellence.  We are
also committed to viable means of communication with all levels
of the organization, the Department of Administration and other
agencies, in a responsible manner.</B>
<P>
<B>SUPPORT:</B>
<P>
<B>We will provide services to the ADOT in a manner that is consistent
with the best interests of the state, the merit system and the
overall mission of the agency.</B>
<P>
<B>WE WILL ACT AS:</B>
<P>
<B>     1.  A consultant--a problem solver with emphasis on Personnel Management.</B>
<P>
<B>     2.  General Advisor--an information resource and clearing house; researching directives, historical analysis, issuance of policies and procedures.</B>
<P>
<B>     3.  Troubleshooter--interpret impact of decisions and proposed actions and alert management.</B>
<P>
<B>     4.  Assistant--work closely with all levels of management on studies, projects, problem areas and find methods for managers/management to meet goals.</B>

<P>
<CENTER><B>NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>In 1994, Human Resources assumed the responsibility for New
Employee Orientation.  This new responsibility was actually designed
by the Coach and has not only been a success, but the talk of
other state agencies.  This new and unique orientation brings
all new employees to Phoenix along with a &quot;buddy&quot; (a
seasoned ADOT employee, normally the supervisor) for two days
of briefings by the Coach, Assistant Coach, Assistant Directors,
Deferred Compensation, State Retirement System, Community Relations,
Human Resources, Affirmative Action and Group Insurance Benefits.</B>
<P>
<B>On the second day, they receive a briefing on the Governor's
Freeway Plan and a tour of a construction site, freeway management
system, Arizona Highways Magazine, Human Resource Development
Center and the infamous, Freeway Tunnel.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>GENERAL SALARY ADJUSTMENTS</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Salary, General Adjustments and Merit Increases have always
been the center of discussion, the focus of many coffee breaks
and the rallying call of all state employees.  We thought you
would like to see that although we have remained well behind the
private sector, we have received some raises over the years.</B>

<CENTER><B>PERSONNEL ISSUES AGENDA--MONTHLY CLASS</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>We host a Personnel Issues Class every month at the HRDC. 
This class is approximately four hours long, results in credit
to your training record and covers the Personnel Rules, the Policies
and Procedures, CDL Drug and Alcohol Testing, ADA, EAP, FMLA,
FLSA, A.R.S., Hot Idea Program, Awards and Recognition, Classification,
Fitness for Duty, RESUMIX, HRMS and many more subjects.  If you
have not attended or do not know what these terms mean, then you
should call the HRDC (255-7613) and schedule yourself for a class.
 While this class is primarily for Supervisors/Managers, we welcome
anyone who wants to know more about Personnel.  Some supervisors
bring one or two direct reports with them!</B>

<P>
<CENTER><B>EPAS SYSTEM</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>THE EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN
1986 AND FOLLOWED THE PREVIOUS PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND EVALUATION
REPORT (PP&amp;E).  THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS
WAS THE REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP THE PP&amp;E FROM THE PDQ WITH
RESPONSIBILITIES AND STANDARDS/RESULTS EXPECTED UP FRONT BY THE
EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISOR, WHEREAS THE EPAS WAS GENERIC IN ADDRESSING
BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD APPLY TO ANY AND ALL, EMPLOYEES.
 THE EPAS HAD 26 SEPARATE PERFORMANCE FACTORS WITH RATINGS OF
&quot;UNACCEPTABLE&quot; &quot;BELOW STANDARDS&quot; &quot;STANDARD&quot;
AND EXCEEDS STANDARDS.&quot;  SINCE THERE ARE EIGHT TOTAL RATINGS
AVAILABLE IT CONTINUES TO BE CONTROVERSIAL.  CYCLE TIME FOR BOTH
EVALUATIONS WERE AND REMAIN THE SAME:  ORIGINAL AND PROMOTIONAL
PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES WERE EVALUATED TWICE DURING THE FIRST SIX
MONTHS OF PROBATION, NORMALLY AT THE END OF THE THIRD AND FIFTH
MONTHS, TO DETERMINE THE AWARDING OF PERMANENT STATUS.  CHANGES
IN SUPERVISION AFTER A PERIOD OF EIGHT RATING WEEKS, SPECIAL REPORTS
WHEN STANDARDS WERE NOT MET, DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, ETC., WERE
ALL REFLECTED IN THE  PP&amp;E AND THE EPAS.  BOTH THE EPAS AND
PP&amp;E REQUIRE A DISCUSSION AT MID-POINT (NORMALLY OCTOBER 31)
AND ANNUAL CLOSE OUT IN APRIL.</B>

<CENTER><B>PROJECT SLIM/REDEPLOYMENT</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>IN 1992, PROJECT SLIM (STATEWIDE LONG-TERM IMPROVED MANAGEMENT)
STUDIED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND STREAMLINED PROCESSES
THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY.  A REDEPLOYMENT PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED
TO FIND JOBS FOR THOSE WHO WISHED TO REMAIN IN STATE SERVICE AND
TO PROCESS THOSE WHO WISHED TO LEAVE, UNDER A BUYOUT PROGRAM.
 ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THAT PROGRAM WERE SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED.
 LATER PROGRAMS AND SITUATIONS WERE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>OLIVER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>IN 1995, THE OLIVER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM WAS CONTRACTED BY
THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION VIA PRICE WATERHOUSE
AND THE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM.  </B>
<P>
<B>THE STATE'S CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM SERVES AS THE CORE OF THE
STATE'S HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  FROM THE CLASSIFICATION
SYSTEM SPRINGS THE COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES, THE REQUIREMENTS
(EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE) NECESSARY TO FILL POSITIONS AND THE
HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIP OF POSITIONS WITHIN THE STATE.</B>
<P>
<B>SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S, THE STATE OF ARIZONA HAS USED A WHOLE
JOB RANKING SYSTEM OF JOB EVALUATION WHICH REQUIRES COMPARISON
OF THE OVERALL CONTENT OF EACH JOB.  OVER TIME, THIS SYSTEM HAS
INCREASED TO OVER 1500 CLASSIFICATIONS, RESULTING IN TOO MANY
CLASSES THAT ARE TOO NARROWLY DEFINED.  IT HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY
MAINTAINED, IMPACTING ON AGENCY MANAGEMENT'S ABILITY TO HIRE AND
RETAIN APPROPRIATE STAFF.  IT ALSO IS LABOR INTENSIVE, CUMBERSOME,
TIME CONSUMING, SUBJECTIVE, AND EASILY MANIPULATED.  AS A RESULT,
IT NO LONGER SERVES ARIZONA'S NEEDS.</B>
<P>
<B>BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND COMPLAINTS
FROM USERS, THE NEED FOR A MORE CURRENT, OBJECTIVE AND EASILY
UNDERSTOOD CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION SYSTEM WAS IDENTIFIED.
 THIS NEED WAS VERIFIED BY AGENCY HEADS DURING THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT
OF ADMINISTRATION'S APRIL 1994 SURVEY, AND BY THE FINDINGS OF
OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS HIRED BY THE OFFICE OF EXCELLENCE IN GOVERNMENT.
 AS A RESULT, DURING THE 1994 LEGISLATIVE SESSION, GOVERNOR SYMINGTON
AND THE ARIZONA LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE ADOA TO EXAMINE A NEW
POINT-FACTOR JOB EVALUATION SYSTEM AS A POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT FOR
THE CURRENT SYSTEM.</B>
<P>
<B>THE NEW CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM SELECTED TO BE USED IS THE POINT-FACTOR
JOB EVALUATION SYSTEM KNOWN AS THE OLIVER SYSTEM.  THE OLIVER
SYSTEM PRESENTLY IS BEING USED BY NUMEROUS PUBLIC JURISDICTIONS,
INCLUDING OTHER STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.</B>
<P>
<B>THE OLIVER SYSTEM:</B>
<P>
<B><UL>
<LI>ASSIGNS POINTS TO THE MOST IMPORTANT ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF JOBS, AND TRANSLATES THAT INFORMATION INTO A PAY GRADE BASED ON TOTAL NUMBER OF POINTS.
</UL></B>
<P>
<B> <UL>
<LI>HAS BEEN IN USE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND SUPPORTS PERFORMANCE BASED EVALUATION MEASURES
</UL></B>
<P>
<B><UL><LI>PROVIDES CLEAR GROUPINGS OR JOB FAMILIES THAT WILL ENABLE
EMPLOYEES TO PLAN THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH  THAT FAMILY.</UL></B>
<P>
<B><UL><LI>INCLUDES PAY STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IN COMPENSATION
METHODS, DEPENDING ON FUNDING, WHICH COULD INCLUDE BUT WOULD NOT
BE LIMITED TO GENERAL SALARY ADJUSTMENT, PAY FOR PERFORMANCE,
RANGE MOVEMENT, PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVES,  STIPENDS AND GEOGRAPHIC
DIFFERENTIALS.</UL></B>
<P>
<B>WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO:</B>
<P>
<B><UL><LI>REDUCE THE NUMBER OF JOB CLASSES FROM 1,500 TO 500 OR
LESS</UL></B>
<P>
<B><UL><LI>REDUCE THE NUMBER OF AGENCY CLASSIFICATION AND RECLASSIFICATION

<P>
<CENTER><B>MINIMUM WAGE CHANGE</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>The minimum wage is going to be increased from the current
$4.25 per hour in two steps:</B>
<P>
<B>The first change will take the minimum wage up to $4.75 an
hour as of October 1, 1996.  The second step will be implemented
on September 1, 1997, when the minimum wage is due to increase
to $5.15 an hour.</B>
<P>
<B>Effective October 1 of this year, all employees except those
certified as exempt from the minimum wage requirements of the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) will be eligible for the higher
starting rate several salary range minimums will be adjusted,
as well as moving the hourly rates of all employees in these salary
ranges to the new minimums.  For Cycle B employees, their October
10 paychecks will include 4 days (32 hours) of pay at the higher
rates.</B>
<P>
<B><CENTER>ASRS FACT SHEET</CENTER></B>
<P>
<B>HISTORY AND OVERVIEW</B>
<P>
<B>The ASRS was created in 1953 to provide defined contribution
benefits to employees of the state, state universities and political
subdivisions in Arizona.  Arizona teachers joined the system in
1954, effective January 1, 1955.  In 1970, the state legislature
authorized the creation of the present defined benefit plan, which
became effective July 1, 1971.</B>
<P>
<B>The ASRS is administered in accordance with Title 38, Chapter
5, of the Arizona Revised Statutes.  Generally all employees of
an employer member who are engaged to work at least twenty weeks
in a fiscal year and at least twenty hours a week qualify for
membership in the retirement plan.  Membership is mandatory for
those employees who meet the membership criteria.</B>
<P>
<B>Based on a study of 31 systems of similar size, conducted by
the university of Wisconsin.  The ASRS is rated highest in benefit
payments.  This is partially due to the social security benefit
you are eligible for in addition to your ASRS benefit.  No other
system has as low a contribution rate and as high a monthly benefit.
 The ASRS is a 14 billion dollar program with 1.1% over funding.</B>
<P>
<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
<P>
<B>The plan is described as a cost-sharing, multiple employer,
public employee, tax qualified, defined benefit retirement plan.
 By &quot;cost-sharing,&quot; we mean that both the employee and
the employer contribute to the member's retirement as an equal
percentage of compensation paid.</B>
<P>
<B>The Plan serves over 350 public employers, including the state,
all but one county (La Paz), many local governments, the public
school districts, the state universities, and colleges, and miscellaneous
other political subdivisions of the state, and covers about 240,000
active, retired and inactive members.  Private employers are not
eligible for membership.</B>
<P>
<B>The Plan is tax qualified under Section 401 (a) of the Internal
Revenue Code and member (employee) contributions are tax deferred
from federal income tax as an employer pick-up plan under Section
414(h) of the Code.  Payments made to members in the form of a
retirement benefit or refund become taxable when paid.</B>
<P>
<B>BENEFITS</B>
<P>
<B>As a defined benefit retirement plan, ASRS pays retirement
benefits determined by a set formula.  A member's benefit is equal
to his average monthly compensation times his total credited service
times a factor set by statute.  The average compensation is the
average of the amount paid over the highest 36 consecutive months
within the last ten years of service.  Credited service is determined
from the period of employment during which the employee was a
member of and making the required contributions to the Plan. 
The multiple factor is two percent.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Benefit formula</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>ASRS Retirement Benefit = Average monthly Compensation  x 
Total Service Credit  x  2%</B>
<P>
<a href="/ABOUT/humanres/asrslog.htm"><B>View ASRS Fact Sheet Example</B></a>
<P>
<B>Other Benefits:</B>
<P>
<B> Long term disabillity (LTD) program--in the event of a qualifying
disabillity the LTD program pays to an ASRS member two-thirds
of the member's salary after a six month waiting period.  The
LTD program is provided through a separate, stand-alone program
with premiums from the employee and the employer in addition to
the retirement contribution.</B>
<P>
<B> Group medical and dental coverage--available to ASRS retired
and disabled members.</B>
<P>
<B> Health insurance premium benefit--paid to ASRS retired and
disabled members.</B>
<P>
<B> Health insurance premium benefit--paid to ASRS retired and
disabled members with five or more years of service credit, to
help cover the cost of health insurance.  The recipient must be
covered by either the employer's health insurance plan or the
ASRS group plan.</B>
<P>
<B>CONTRIBUTION RATES</B>
<P>
<B> The retirement contribution rate is determined each year by
actuarial valuation as the rate required to fund future benefit
obligations and maintain the financial well-being of the Plan.
 The retirement contribution rate for members and employers for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, is 3.36 percent of compensation;
<U>the rate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1996 is 3.20
percent.</U>  The contribution is a pre-tax salary item for members.</B>
<P>
<B> Beginning for pay periods ending July 1, 1995, or later, in
addition to the retirement contribution, a separate premium for
long term disability (LTD) coverage is payable at a rate 0.49
percent of compensation from both the member and the employer.
 (Prior to July 1, 1995, the LTD cost was included in the contribution
rate.)  The long term disability premium is not tax deferred and
is not redundable to the member.</B>
<P>
<B> PORTABILITY</B>
<P>
<B> Most public employers in Arizona are members of ASRS.  Employees
moving from one employer member to another retain their retirement
membership in the Plan.  Statutory provisions also permit the
transfer of service credit to and from the other public employee
retirement systems in the state, including the Public Safety Personnel
Retirement System (PSPRS), Correctional Officers' Retirement Plan
(CORP), Elected Officials;Retirement Plan (EORP) and the City
of Phoenix and City of Tucson retirement plans.  The ASRS also
has generous provisions permitting the purchase of ASRS credited
service for previous service under another public retirement plan.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I request a &quot;clearance letter&quot;?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You must send a notarized request that includes your full
name, date of birth and driver license number or social security
number to the Motor Vehicle Division, PO Box 2100, Mail Drop 504M,
Phoenix, Arizona 85001. There is a $5.00 fee for a clearance
letter.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I change my address on my driver license?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>If you simply want to notify MVD of the change without
receiving another driver license, you may submit the information
by telephone (602)255-0072, mail, or by completing a change of
address card in your nearest MVD facility. You will be required
to provide your full name, date of birth, driver license number,
old address and new address.</EM>
<P>
<EM>If you want the address change reflected on your driver license,
you must visit your nearest Driver License facility and apply
for a duplicate license; there is a $12 application fee for this
transaction.  The record will be updated at the time the new credential
is issued.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is an MVR?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>MVR stands for Motor Vehicle Record - it is the computer
printout of your driving record.  You can obtain a copy of your
record by completing the necessary form and submitting $3.00 for
a 39-month record or $5.00 for a five-year certified record. </EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What tickets will show if an insurance company runs my MVR?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Any convictions received and showing on your driving record
within the past 39 months will be provided to an insurance company.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How many points do I have on my driving record?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>The amount of points depends on the violations. A customer
service representative can give you this information by telephone
when you provide your full name, date of birth and driver license
number.  The number is (602)255-0072.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How long do points stay on your driving record?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Points stay on your record for one year from the date of
conviction. For major violations (6-8 points), five years. 
</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Why do I have to attend Traffic Survival School?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You have been convicted of tickets that total 8-12 points
in a twelve-month period.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What tickets do I have on my driving record?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>A customer service representative can give you this information
by telephone (602)255-0072 when you provide your full name, date
of birth and driver license number.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Who might request my five-year certified record?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>An employer or an insurance company may request a five-year
record.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Why is my driver license suspended/revoked?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>It depends on the violation. A customer service representative
can give you this information by telephone (602)255-0072 when
you provide your full name, date of birth and driver license number.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is the difference between a suspension and a revocation?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>A <U>suspension</U> has a specific start and end date; when the
suspension period ends, the licensee pays the reinstatement fee
and any reapplication fees to restore her driving privilege.</EM>
<P>
<EM><U>Revocations</U> are indefinite; there is a minimum length of time,
usually one year, but the action does not automatically end on
that date.  The individual must go through an investigation process
to determine whether it would be safe to restore her driving privilege.
 If approved for reinstatement, there would be reinstatement and
reapplication fees.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How can I clear a suspension?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>This can vary, depending on the reason for the suspension.
 Court ordered suspensions require a clearance from the court.
 Other suspensions may require an SR-22. Once any required documentation
is obtained, take the documents to your local driver license facility
and pay the appropriate reinstatement and reapplication fees.
 A vision screening will be required, and you may be asked to
take a written and/or road skills test. <STRONG>(See Question #23 for information on clearing a revocation.)</STRONG></EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What do I need to do if I have moved out of state and just
now received a suspension notice?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Depending on the violation, the customer may be eligible
for a phone hearing or they may send the necessary reinstatement
requirements by mail. Contact a Customer Service Representative
at (602)255-0072 to review your record and determine what action
is necessary.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>When can I apply for a restricted driving permit?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Provided you meet the necessary requirements, a restricted
driving permit can be issued to you either by mail or in any Driver
License office.  &quot;Necessary requirements&quot; would be:</EM>
<MENU>
<LI>when a breath, blood or urine test has been submitted to
MVD indicating a blood alcohol level of .10 or more and: 
<LI> it is the first DUI within five years, and 
the DUI did not result in serious physical injury.
<LI>when found guilty of driving without insurance.
<LI>when otherwise directed by the court.
</MENU>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is an SR22?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>An SR22 is future proof of financial responsibility - the
insurance company is required to notify the Division immediately
upon cancellation of insurance, rather than submitting the cancellation
notice with their routine monthly business.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How long am I required to have an SR22?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You will need an SR22 for a period of three years, unless
it is a judgment suspension.  Judgment suspension requirements
can vary from case to case - you must contact a customer service
representative at (602)255-0072 to review the record and determine
the length of time you would need to maintain the SR22 on a judgment
suspension.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is a judgment suspension?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>A judgment is generally a court order issued when someone
has had an accident and was not insured.  The judgment suspension
is placed on the driving record in accordance with the court order.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How can I clear a revocation?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>If the license is revoked, you must request an investigation
packet.  Once the packet is completed, submit it to the Division.
 The investigation process takes approximately 90-120 days.  If
your reinstatement request is approved, you will pay the necessary
reinstatement and reapplication fees and your privileges will
be restored.  If your request is denied, however, you must wait
one year before you are eligible to reapply.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I obtain an Investigation Packet?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>By calling (602)255-0072 and asking that a packet by sent
to you.  The customer service representative may require your
full name, date of birth and driver license number at the time
of the call to verify your eligibility for applying for reinstatement.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>When am I going to hear about my investigation?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You will receive a response within 90 to 120 days from
the date the packet was submitted.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I schedule a hearing?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>By submitting a written request to the Motor Vehicle Division,
PO Box 2100, Mail Drop 507M, Phoenix, Arizona 85001.</EM>

<LI><STRONG>What hours are the MVD offices open?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>All offices are open Monday through Friday, 7:00A-5:30P. We also have some locations open Saturdays from 8:00A-1:00P. Inspection lanes close 1/2 hour before the offices. See the </EM><A HREF="/mvd/mvdhrs.htm">Office Locations and Hours</A><EM> listing for the one nearest you.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How much does it cost to register my vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>It varies depending on the vehicle. The actual registration
fee is $8.00 or $8.25, depending on where you live, PLUS $1.50
Air Quality Fee PLUS the vehicle license tax (VLT); there may
also be a weight fee, depending on the vehicle and the weight
the customer wants to declare. The VLT is figured based on the
manufacturer's base retail price, less depreciation (60% the first
year and 15% per year thereafter) to determine the assessed value,
then calculating $4.00 per $100.00 of the assessed value. There
is a $10 minimum VLT fee.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How much is it for a title only?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>$4.00 when you walk in the office - $4.66 when you mail
it in.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What documents do I need to transfer a title?</STRONG>
<BR>
<MENU>
<LI><EM>Completed, signed title application</EM>

fees if the vehicle is not currently registered in this state)</EM>
<LI><EM>Any other documents that would follow (power of attorney,

<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I get a duplicate title and how much is it?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Complete an application for title, check the appropriate
box at the top of the form, and pay the applicable fee ($4.00
for walk in, $4.66 for mail in). A photo identification may be
requested of walk-in customers.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I get a replacement tab/plate and what is the fee?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>This may be accomplished at an auto license facility or
by mail. For walk-ins, one piece of identification is required,
and you must have the license plate and/or vehicle identification
number. A lost plate affidavit will be completed, and a $5.00
fee will be assessed. To transact by mail will take longer; you
must call a customer service representative at (602)255-0072 and
request that the affidavit be mailed to you. Return the completed
affidavit, including license plate and/or vehicle identification
number, with the $5.00 service charge (plus postage) and the replacement
will be returned by mail.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>I sold my car - what do I need to do?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>As the seller, you must sign off the back of the title
and have your signature notarized. Give the title to the purchaser.
 Complete the notice of sale on the reverse side of the registration
and mail it to MVD at the address indicated - do not give the
registration form/notice of sale to the purchaser.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>My vehicle was involved in an accident and I no longer
have it - what do I do?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Complete the notice of sale on the reverse side of your
registration and send it to MVD at the address indicated. Sign
off the back of the title, have your signature notarized, and
give the title to your insurance company so they can apply for
a salvage title; or if you have sold it to a salvage yard, you
must apply for a salvage certificate of title and give it to the
salvage yard.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>My vehicle has not been in use, and the registration has
lapsed. How do I re-register my vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>If last registered within five years, provide the license
plate and/or vehicle identification number and pay applicable
fees. In most cases, a non-use affidavit can be completed to
waive the penalties. If your vehicle has not been registered
within the last five years, additional procedures may be required.
 A customer service representative (602)255-0072 would be able
to discuss any additional requirements after reviewing your record.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I obtain a trip permit?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Trip permits, which are valid for three days (excluding
weekends and holidays), may be purchased at your local MVD Auto
License facility for $1.00 - no documents are needed, although
a vehicle description and identification number must be provided.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I apply for a bonded title?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>First, you must get a vehicle inspection. Request the
legal name of the last known owner and mail a certified letter
to the owner. Have the MVD agent set a bond amount, purchase
a Motor Vehicle Surety Bond and follow the instructions sent to
you by mail. There will likely be additional documents and steps
to follow, which may vary with each situation.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I apply for a restored salvage title?</STRONG>
<BR>
<MENU>
<LI><EM>Complete and sign a title application</EM>
<LI><EM>Have a Level II inspection conducted</EM>
<LI><EM>Obtain an emissions compliance certificate (if applicable)</EM>
<LI><EM>Surrender the salvage title with the application</EM>
<LI><EM>Pay required fees ($4.00 walk in, $4.66 mail in, plus registration
fees, if applicable)</EM>
</MENU>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Where do I go to get an inspection on my vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Level I inspections can be done at any MVD Auto License
office.  Level II inspections are conducted at specific offices
in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. Outside the metro
area, contact your nearest MVD Auto License office for locations.
 You may also call (602)255-0072 to obtain location information.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I add/delete a name to my title?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Complete and sign a title application, sign off the back
of the title and have the signature notarized, and pay any related
fees ($12.00 for walk in customers, $12.66 for mail in, plus registration
fees, if applicable). If there is a lien on the vehicle, you
will also need a lien release or a letter of permission from the
lienholder.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How do I add/delete a lien to my title?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Complete and sign the title application, including the
lien information, and submit with the most current title and lien
release (if applicable). There is a $4.00 fee for this service
($4.66 for mail-in transactions).</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Why did I receive a registration cancellation notice?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>This could be the result of money due to the Division,
no insurance on file, or other issues. A customer service representative
will require the owner's name, license plate number and vehicle
identification number to check the vehicle record. The number
to call is (602)255-0072.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is a 30/90 permit and when would I need one?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>A <U>30-day permit</U> is for any type of problem that would stop
you from registering; only one 30-day permit may be issued per
year per owner.</EM>
<P>
<EM>A <U>90-day permit</U> is for individuals who are missing paperwork necessary to transfer an out-of-state vehicle title; two consecutive permits
may be issued within a 12-month period.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How can I get a 30/90 permit?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>The permit may be purchased at your nearest MVD Auto License
office for $15.00 - you will need proof of ownership and evidence
of the inability to register (failed emissions certificate, identify
missing paperwork, etc.).</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>I am not an Arizona resident, but I bought a car from an
Arizona dealer.  Is there a permit I can purchase to drive this
unregistered vehicle to my home state?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You can purchase a 30-day non-resident permit for $15.00
from the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division or authorized third party.
 You will be required to show your out-of-state identification
and the dealer invoice.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>If I give you a plate number, can you tell me who owns
the vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>No - ARS 28-210.F requires the name of the owner, vehicle
identification number and license plate number before any information
can be provided from the vehicle record. There is a fee ranging
from $2.00-$5.00 (depending on the information being requested) to obtain
a printout of vehicle record information.</EM>

If you travel or work near Sky Harbor International Airport, the Arizona
Department of Transportation wants you to know about the Sky Harbor Expressway,
a new freeway now open for airport commuters.
<p>
Now all airport travelers and commuters can enjoy the convenience of this
new expressway without the headaches of getting mixed up in local commuter

Washington Street across the Salt River to University Drive.  It's as simple as
following the signs for State Route 153.
<p>

<P>
<H3>What is the Customer Service Guide?</H3>
<P>
The Customer Service Guide is a helpful and handy reference for
customers of the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) and is intended
to provide our customers better service and information. This
guide begins with the first steps on how to acquire an Arizona
driver license and eventually goes into more detail about the
various functions of MVD and the state laws which guide them.
<P>
Some of the information covered in this guide includes: how
to receive faster service, what documents are required for various
transactions, fees for various transactions, requirements of Arizona
drivers by MVD and state statutes, how to obtain a special plate,
mandatory insurance, safety belts, etc. Feel free to explore
the Motor Vehicle Division in more detail through this guide and
apply the knowledge you gain for a more positive experience
in achieving your needs as an Arizona driver.
<P>
<H3>New Residents &quotHow To&quot Apply for Arizona Driver's License</H3>
<P>
All Arizona residents operating motor vehicles must obtain Arizona
driver licenses. To apply, you must appear in person at one of
the state's driver license offices. To locate the nearest driver
license station, dial 255-0072 and press 1. You will be asked
to enter your ZIP code. You will then be told where the nearest
driver license station is located. General hours of operation
for the driver license offices are between 8A - 5P, Monday
thru Friday. Various offices offer extended hours of operation,
such as from 5P to 6P during weekdays and/or 8A thru 1P on
Saturdays. Our offices are usually the busiest right after holidays
and the beginning and end of the month/week.  For further
information, the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT)
has an internet website at http//:www.dot.state.az.us that
provides useful information on the Motor Vehicle Division
including <A HREF="mvdhrs.htm">Office Locations and Hours</a>.
<P>
All applicants must successfully complete the required vision
screening. New residents in possession of a valid license from
their previous state of residence are usually exempt from the
driving skills and written tests when applying for a Class D or
M license; however, this exemption is discretionary. Always obtain
a driver license manual and familiarize yourself with Arizona
rules of the road. The minimum age to apply for a learner's permit
is 15 years and 7 months. Individuals must be at least 16 years old
to apply for an operator or motorcycle license.
<P>
A Commercial Driver License (CDL) is required for operators of
commercial vehicles that are: 26,001 pounds or greater gross vehicle
weight rating; capable of carrying 16 or more passengers (including
the driver); or hauling hazardous materials The minimum age to
apply for a CDL is 21. However, individuals at least 18 years
of age may apply for an INTRAstate commercial driver license that
is valid only for commercial vehicle operation in Arizona.
<P>
<H3>Tips For Faster Service When Applying For Your License</H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Study the <A HREF="dlmanual/index.htm">Driver License Manual</A>
thoroughly before applying for your Arizona license. Remember, as new
applicant in Arizona, you may be required to successfully complete written
and road testing. A little studying may help you avoid a second
trip to the driver license office for re-examination.
<P>
<LI>Have a valid driver license with photo from your prior state of
residence to show the license examiner. In most cases, this will
exempt you from testing. If your license has been expired for more than
one year, you will be requested to obtain a clearance (in
writing) from your previous state indicating that your driving
privilege in that state has not been canceled, suspended, or revoked
and you must successfully complete written, vision, and road testing.
<P>
<LI>When applying for an Arizona driver license, individuals need
to provide satisfactory evidence of both identity and age in addition
to authorized presence in the U.S. TWO original or certified copies
(no photocopies) from the <STRONG>PRIMARY</STRONG> and <STRONG>SECONDARY</STRONG> documents lists
below are required and must meet the following specifications
(THREE documents are required if not providing a photo document):
<BR>
<MENU>
<LI>ONE of the documents is required to be from the <STRONG>
PRIMARY</STRONG> list which must include the name and date of birth, and
<BR>
<LI>ONE of the documents must contain a photo, which may be provided
from either the <STRONG>PRIMARY</STRONG> or <STRONG>SECONDARY</STRONG> list.

fee is charged upon re-application. </STRONG>
<BR>
<LI>If you must return later for re-examination, allow plenty of time to visit the nearest driver license office.

<P>
<H3>Tips for Older Drivers</H3>
<P>
For many individuals, age brings changes in body structure and
function that may alter a person's ability to operate a motor
vehicle. This is especially true of older drivers who may be taking
medication. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)
provides an excellent class for older drivers.
<P>
Remember that all medications, prescription and over-the-counter,
are potential safety hazards if you are taking them and operating
a motor vehicle.
<P>
It is unlawful for any person to be in actual physical control
of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
or drugs. This is also true if you are taking medication prescribed
by your doctor.
<P>
<STRONG>The AARP class advises older drivers to:</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Learn about the specific side effects of medication by talking
with your physician or pharmacist. Inform the physician about
every medication you're taking, including over-the-counter medicines and ask how they may affect driving ability.
<BR>
<LI>Most over-the-counter medications for headaches, colds, allergies,
or medications to calm your nerves can make you drowsy and may
affect your ability to control a vehicle. Carefully read directions
about frequency of dosage and possible side effects.
<BR>
<LI>Don't mix medications under any circumstances unless so indicated
by your physician.
<BR>
<LI>Never take medications prescribed for another person.
<BR>
<LI>Although the effects of medications wear off with time, be sure
you have waited long enough to be completely free of any side
effects before driving.

<H3>Driving Test</H3>
<P>
The driving test is an on-road examination of the ability to safely
operate a motor vehicle in accordance with Arizona's laws and
rules of the road. After successfully completing all the other
tests, one must successfully complete this test if you have never
had a driver license, and it may also be required for new Arizona
residents, persons renewing or reinstating their licenses, or
those who cannot provide evidence of prior licensing. The driving
test is not required for a learner's permit.
<P>
During the on-road test one will be given an opportunity to perform
the basic driving patterns and show ability to drive safely in
traffic.
<P>
Driving skills that are observed and graded during the on-road
test include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Observation and planning<BR>
<LI>Approaches to intersections, stop signs and traffic signals<BR>
<LI>Quick stop-stopping as quickly and safely as possible when told to do so<BR>

<H3>Anatomical Gift Program Offers Life To Thousands</H3>
<P>
Many Arizonans will never know the people who gave them a new
chance at life. These people said &quot;Yes&quot; to becoming
organ donors when they received their driver licenses.
<P>
Every year Arizonans die while waiting for an organ transplant.
Each year Arizonans die who might have provided those life-giving
organs had they indicated their wish to be organ donors. The Arizona
Department of Transportation, Motor Vehicle Division
is proud to make this opportunity to donate available to our customers.
The process is quick and easy.
<P>
When receiving an Arizona license (new or renewal), customers will be
provided with organ donor information and donor cards. One of
the cards will contain a peel off sticker. If you wish to be
an organ donor, place the sticker on the back of the license in
the lower right hand corner. Fill out both cards. Keep one with
you, and give the other to a person whom you trust to carry out
your wishes.
<P>
For more information, call: 1-800-94-DONOR or visit the Donor
Network of Arizona's internet website at http://www.donor-network.org/dnet/
<P>
By following these simple steps, you can give the gift of life.
<P>
<H3>Extended Driver License</H3>
<P>
Beginning in 1993, Arizona began phasing in an extended driver
license for Class D and M, valid until a driver's 60th birthday*
providing you successfully complete a vision screening, and update
your photo every 12 years. After age 60, drivers must renew every
five years.* Further, as of August 1996, Arizona began issuing
extended CDL licenses. As a result, most drivers will have little
need to visit the driver license offices or may visit at their
convenience since the update may be done at any time, even when
transacting vehicle title and registration business. This will
save our customers time and money. The license cost is based on
your age at application and renewal.
<P>
<STRONG>* For certain situations, a shorter term license may be prescribed and issued.</STRONG>

<P>
To determine the cost of the extended license, check your current
driver license to find out how old you will be when your license
comes up for renewal, or if you are new to Arizona and applying
for a license, look up that age on the chart. The chart will tell
you what you will pay when you obtain a new license or renew under
the extended system.
<P>
Extending the life of your driver license will help the Motor
Vehicle Division provide better, more efficient service while
saving you time and money.
<H2>Driver Improvement</H2>
<P>
Along with your Arizona driving privilege comes the obligation
to drive responsibly. &quot;Driver Improvement&quot; refers to
the process of identifying persons who are jeopardizing the safety
of others by not driving responsibly. The goal of Driver Improvement
is to modify driving behavior.
<P>
<H3>Revocation</H3>
<P>
Revocation is the removal of your privilege to drive. It is a
mandatory and/or administrative action required by law upon conviction
of certain driving offenses. In accordance with Arizona law, once
your revocation period has ended, your driving privileges will
remain revoked until you apply for and successfully complete an
investigation into your character, habits, and driving ability.
Following satisfactory completion of the investigation, you will
be required to pay a reinstatement fee, appropriate application
fee and you may be required to file a Certificate of Insurance
(commonly known as an SR-22). A written, vision and road test
are required for reinstatement of your license following revocation.
<P>
Arizona law requires mandatory revocation of the driving privilege
upon conviction of the following offenses:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hit-and-run involving death or injury.<BR>
<LI>Driving a vehicle under the influence of any drug.<BR>
<LI>Any homicide involving use of a motor vehicle.<BR>
<LI>Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used.<BR>
<LI>Perjury relating to the ownership or operation of a motor vehicle.<BR>
<LI>Failure to stop and render aid at the site of a traffic crash.
</UL>
<P>
Conviction of a second or subsequent charge of the following offenses
will also result in a mandatory revocation of your driving privileges:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Driving while under the influence of alcohol.<BR>
<LI>Reckless driving.<BR>
<LI>Driving while under the influence (DUI) while your license is
canceled, suspended, revoked, denied or under restriction as a
result of a previous DUI.<BR>
<LI>Racing on the highways.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, your driving privilege may be revoked for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A condition that renders you medically, psychologically or physically
incapable of operating a motor vehicle or continued operation
of a motor vehicle which would endanger the public health, safety
and welfare.<BR>
<LI>Failure to take and pass a required driving re-examination.
Re-examination may be requested by the Motor Vehicle Division
based on the investigation of reports or recommendations from
law enforcement and/or citizens who have observed conditions that
renders you medically, psychologically or physically incapable
of operating a motor vehicle or continued operation of a motor
vehicle that would endanger the public health, safety, and welfare.<BR>
<LI>Committing too many driving violations (point accumulation).
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Suspension/Traffic School</H3>
<P>
Suspension is the temporary removal of your driving privilege.
It is an action which may be taken by the court or by the Motor
Vehicle Division (MVD). The suspension remains in effect until
application for reinstatement is made following completion of
the suspension period. This means that in addition to the reinstatement
fee, you must pay the appropriate reapplication fee for your age
group to purchase a new driver license.
<P>
Each time you are convicted, forfeit bail, or fail to appear in
court for a moving traffic violation, points are assessed against
your permanent driving record. If you accumulate eight or more
points within any 12-month period, you will be required to attend
Traffic Survival School (TSS). Failure to complete will result
in a six month suspension of your driving priviledge.
<P>
Points are assessed as follows:

or tests to determine alcohol concentration or drug content.
</UL>
<P>
Following the suspension or revocation period of your license,
you must pay a reinstatement fee, and the appropriate reapplication
fee to regain your license. In addition, you may be subject to
an investigation, and you may be required to file an SR-22 Insurance
Certificate which you may aquire through your insurance company.
<P>
<H3>License/Permit Cancellation</H3>

cancellation of the license.<BR>
<LI>A person under twenty-one years of age who has falsely or
fraudulently misrepresented their age as twenty-one.<BR>
<LI>A person who does not meet medical requirements.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Failure to Appear/Pay Fine for Traffic Citation</H3>
<P>
Your driver license will not be issued or renewed if the Motor
Vehicle Division has been notified that you have not appeared
in court or otherwise satisfied a traffic violation charge in
Arizona or another state. In addition, your Arizona license will
be suspended for failure to satisfy a traffic citation. When you
are cited for a traffic violation, your signature on the citation
is a promise to appear in traffic court or satisfy the citation
prior to appearance. If you fail to appear in court, or fail to
pay a fine for a violation, the court will order the Motor Vehicle
Division to suspend your driving privilege. The Motor Vehicle
Division will mail notice of the suspension to your address as
it appears on the Division's computer record. In accordance with
Arizona law, notice is complete upon mailing to the Division's
address of record. When you have satisfied the citation with the
court, you must take the court documents indicating satisfaction
to any driver license station to apply for reinstatement of your
driving privilege.
<P>
<H3>Altered or Fictitious License</H3>
<P>
It is unlawful to display any license (including an identification
license) which is known to be canceled, revoked, suspended, fictitious,
or altered. It is also illegal to alter a license or obtain a
false license or to use another person's license. These actions
will result in your driving privilege being suspended for at least
6 months; you are also subject to possible fines and/or a jail
sentence.
<P>
<H3>Driving Under The Influence</H3>
<P>
When applying for and accepting the privilege to drive a vehicle
in Arizona, consent is automatically given to test for alcohol
concentration or drug content if arrested for driving while under
the influence; this is known as the &quot;Implied Consent Law.&quot;
The term &quot;alcohol concentration&quot; (AC) refers to the
amount of alcohol present in the bloodstream. Measurement of alcohol
or drugs in one's system is accomplished by having one submit
to a test or tests of their blood, breath or urine.
<P>
If a law enforcement officer has reason to believe you have been
driving while under the influence of intoxicating substances (DUI)
the officer will request that you submit to testing. If you refuse,
or do not successfully complete the test, your driving privileges
will be suspended by the Motor Vehicle Division for 12 months.
Following the notification of your suspension from the Motor Vehicle
Division, you may request a hearing within 15 days to review the
circumstances of your suspension.
<P>
It is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of intoxicating
liquor or any drugs to drive or be in actual physical control
of any vehicle. If a law enforcement officer administers an alcohol
concentration test for driving under the influence of intoxicating
liquor and finds the AC to be 0.10 percent or more, the person's
driving privilege will be suspended and withdrawn immediately.
If a person is suspected of driving under the influence of any
intoxicating substance (drugs), a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE)
will require the person to submit to a blood or urine test. If
the presence of drugs is found in the person's body, the license
will be suspended. If you are taking drugs prescribed by a physician,
your license may also by suspended if your driving ability is
<EM><STRONG>impaired to the slightest degree.</STRONG></EM>
<P>
<H3>Getting Caught Under 21 Is No Fun!</H3>
<P>
Remember Arizona's Zero Tolerance Law! A person under 21 years
of age is considered to be under the influence of intoxicating
liquor or drugs if there is any &quot;alcohol concentration or
drugs&quot; in the person's body.
<P>
There are many conditions that can affect a person's ability to
drive even after one drink or taking prescription drugs, for example-body
weight, emotional state, or physical condition. <STRONG>The best rule
to follow is - if you drink or take drugs, DO NOT DRIVE. </STRONG>
<P>
<H3>0.10 is Not a Magic Number</H3>
<P>
Many people believe that if they do not have 0.10 alcohol concentration,
they cannot be arrested and suspended for DUI. This is not true!
Arizona law provides that one may be arrested and have their license
suspended if <EM><STRONG>impaired to the slightest degree</STRONG></EM> by drugs
or alcohol.
<P>
<H3>Driving Under the Influence Penalties</H3>
<P>
The penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs
(DUI) are:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>First<BR>Offense</STRONG></TD><TD>You will be jailed for not less than 10 days, fined
not less than $250, and there will be a 90-day suspension of yourdriver license. You will also be required to undergo alcohol screening/education/treatment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Aggravated DUI</STRONG></TD><TD>You will be sent to prison not less than 4 months,
and your driver license will be revoked for three years. (This offense is a class 4 felony.)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
In addition to any criminal penalties imposed by the court for
a second or third offense DUI violation, your driving privilege
will automatically be revoked by the Motor Vehicle Division.
<P>
<STRONG>Remember: If you are stopped for driving under the influence
and a test shows that you have an alcohol concentration of 0.10
percent or more or that if your driving ability is <EM>impaired
to the slightest degree</EM>, you will lose your driving privilege
on the spot.</STRONG>
<P>
<H3>Title and Registration of an Out-of-State Vehicle</H3>
<P>
Welcome to Arizona, the beautiful Grand Canyon State! To better
help you enjoy your new home state and motoring experience, we
offer the following general tips for registering your vehicle:
<P>
All Arizona residents, unless exempt, must register their vehicles
in Arizona.
<P>
Arizona statute requires every motor vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer
operated, moved or left standing on any highway in this state,
unless exempted by state statute, be properly registered.
<P>
<H3>Arizona Residency Requirements</H3>
<P>
For the purposes of vehicle registration, the definition of &quot;<STRONG>resident</STRONG>&quot;
is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Any person who, regardless of domicile, remains in this
state for an aggregate period of seven months or more during any
calendar year.
<BR>
<LI>Any person who engages in a trade, profession or occupation
in this state or who accepts employment in other than seasonal
agricultural work or temporary seasonal work for less than three
months.
<BR>
<LI>Any person placing children in public school without
payment of non-resident tuition.
<BR>
<LI>Any person who declares himself to be a resident of this
state for the purpose of obtaining at resident rates, a
state license or tuition fees at an educational institution maintained
by public funds.
<BR>
<LI>Any individual, partnership, company, firm, corporation
or association which maintains a main office, branch office or
warehouse facilities in this state, and which bases and operates
motor vehicles in this state.
<BR>
<LI>Any individual, partnership, company, firm, corporation
or association which operates motor vehicles intrastate (within
Arizona), for other than seasonal agricultural work.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Keep Your Address with MVD Current</H3>
<P>
You are required by law to notify MVD within ten days of any change
to your address. (If your current address is not on file, you
may not receive renewal notices or other correspondence concerning
your driver license or vehicle registration.) You may change your
address record by obtaining a postage-free postcard at any Arizona
MVD office, filling it out and returning it, or by calling the
MVD Driver License Record Section at 255-0072. Information needed
for an address change is your name, date of birth, old address
with zip code, new address with zip code, driver license number.
In addition, if you own a vehicle you will need to provide your
plate and vehicle identification number (VIN). If you wish to
show your new address on your license, you may apply for a duplicate
license ($4 fee) at any driver license office.
<P>
<H3>Arizona Registration and Vehicle License Tax</H3>
<P>
Arizona has established a system of monthly staggered registration.
Upon initial registration in Arizona, your expiration date will
be twelve months from the first day of the month following the
month you apply for registration, excluding certain vehicles with
set expiration dates. Future registration notices will display
your established month of expiration. Annual payment must be made
on or before the last day of the month shown on your registration,
or you will be subject to a late penalty fee.
<P>
Registration must be renewed as indicated by month/year indication
on registration form. License plates cannot be transferred from
one owner to another. However, plates may be transferred among
vehicles under the same ownership upon application and payment
of a $10 fee. If your license plate is lost or stolen, a duplicate
must be obtained. The fee is $5. The fee for a duplicate registration
card is $4.
<P>
Arizona's vehicle license tax (VLT) is an &quot;<EM>in-lieu</EM>&quot;
tax, that is, it is in-lieu of a personal property tax. The tax
is assessed on the motor vehicle at a rate of $4 per $100 of assessed
(taxable) value. Assessed value is sixty percent of the manufacturer's
base retail price of the vehicle upon initial registration of
a new vehicle. This value depreciates 15 percent each year thereafter.
<P>
The vehicle license tax collected by the Motor Vehicle Division
or persons it contracts with is distributed via formula to the
State Highway User Revenue Fund, State General Fund, County General
Funds for aid in school finance, Incorporated cities and towns,
and the Motor Vehicle Division.

We will accept an <STRONG>ADOT</STRONG> approved certificate of insurance,
a Form E or a certificate of self-insurance.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The following steps must be taken in order to obtain an Arizona
title, registration and license plates for a vehicle previously
titled or registered in another state. Please note this is general
information only. Since each titling and registration action may
present unique situations, other actions may be required. For
more detailed information regarding a specific transaction, please
call 255-0072 during weekdays, and between 8am and 1pm on Saturdays
or visit one of our offices.</STRONG>
<H4>Physical Inspection of the Vehicle (conducted at our facilities)</H4>
In accordance with Arizona law, the make, identification number,
body style and other general vehicle information must be verified.
If there are obvious safety or mechanical flaws, registration
will be denied until repair is completed.
<P>
<H4>Emissions Test (see the White Pages Business listing
under &quot;Arizona Vehicle Inspection Program&quot; for locations)</H4>
State law requires that the Department of Environmental Quality
(DEQ) inspect all motor vehicles, model year 1967 and newer (including
diesels; excluding golf carts, and motorcycles 89cc and less)
registering in Maricopa and Pima Counties must be inspected for
vehicle emissions prior to registration. Emissions tests will
differ, depending on the county of residence, the model year of
the vehicle and other criteria. All vehicles subject to testing
will recieve a tampering inspection for the presence of certain
emissions control equipment (catalytic converter, operational
air pump, etc.) All vehicles must successfully complete the prescribed
emissions test or obtain a waiver from the DEQ. The emissions
test fee is paid at the time of testing.
<P>
Vehicle emissions testing is administered by the Arizona Department
of Environmental Quality. Call 470-4646 or 1-800-284-7748 for
further details regarding emissions testing requirements.
<P>
<H4>Proof of Ownership</H4>
The most recent out-of-state title and registration must be surrendered
at the time of application for Arizona title and registration.
However, when a loan has been recorded against the vehicle and
the title is being held by the lender in another state, the title
may not be required.
<P>
<H4>Loan Information</H4>
If the title shows a loan and that <STRONG>has been paid in full</STRONG>,
an original lien clearance provided by the lender is required
to issue an Arizona title without a lien. If the title shows a
loan that <STRONG>has not been paid in full</STRONG>, a letter from the
lien holders on their letterhead is required and must provide
the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make and style of vehicle,
the amount owed on loan, the original loan amount, the date of
the contract, and the lender's complete name and mailing address.
The lien will be recorded on the Arizona title.
<P>
<H4>Proof of Insurance</H4>
Arizona has a Mandatory Vehicle Insurance Law. Liability insurance
is required for all registered vehicles and proof of current liability
coverage must be carried in any vehicle operated on the roadways
of this state (this includes golf carts, motorcycles and mopeds).
By applying for or renewing a vehicle registration, the applicant
consents to comply with the insurance verifications conducted
by the state. Evidence of liability coverage must be shown upon
request of a law enforcement officer. Failure to comply may result
in the suspension of vehicle plates and registration, and owner(s)
and operator(s) driver license(s).
<P>
Arizona law requires a minimum of $15,000 bodily injury insurance
for one person, a minimum of $30,000 bodily injury insurance for
two people, and $10,000 insurance for property damage. This insurance
must be obtained before operating any vehicle on any street or
highway within this state through companies authorized to do business
in Arizona.
<P>
<H4>Plates</H4>
Out-of-state license plates must be surrendered when you obtain
Arizona plates. Special plates are available for issuance to most vehicles. Call
255-7520 for more information regarding types of plates available,
requirements and how to apply.
<P>
<H4>Signatures</H4>
All owners as listed on the out-of-state title must sign the application
for an Arizona title. An original (not a copy) notarized power
of attorney is acceptable to allow an appointed person to sign
on behalf of one or more of the owners.
<P>
<H4>Ninety Day Permits</H4>
An Arizona resident who does not have complete documentation for
issuance of a title or registration may apply for a ninety day
permit. This permit allows the owner to operate the vehicle while
obtaining additional documentation. Cost of the permit is $15.
Vehicle License Taxes will be calculated back to the date of permit
issuance.
<P>
<H4>Mandatory Insurance</H4>
Arizona requires that every motor vehicle operated on our roadways
be covered by one of the statuatory forms of financial responsibility
or as it is more commonly called, liability insurance. Evidence
of financial responsibility or insurance must be carried in the
vehicle at all times the vehicle is operated on the roadway and
be presented to a law enforcement officer upon request.
<P>
Minimum levels of financial responsibility are:
<UL>
<LI>$15,000 bodily injury liability for one person injured or
killed and $30,000 for two or more persons, and
<LI>$10,000 property damage liability.
</UL>
<P>
In addition to verification by law enforcement officers at the
time of traffic stops or accidents, financial responsibility is
verified by the Motor Vehicle Division on all vehicles registered
in the state. Insurance companies notify the Motor Vehicle Division
of all policy cancellations, non-renewals, and new policies. If
your insurance company sends MVD a notice that your policy is
no longer active, the MVD will send you an inquiry notice to verify
insurance status. Notices of inquiry are mailed to the vehicle
owners address of record requesting response indicating the status
of coverage.
<P>
Failure to maintain proper financial responsibility could lead
to the suspension of your vehicle registration and/or driver license.
To reinstate these privileges, fees and future proof of financial
responsibility must be filed with MVD. The future proof requirement
is most commonly satisfied by the filing of an SR22 form and can
be expensive to the vehicle owner, especially since the law requires
the owner to carry the SR22 for three years from the date of suspension.
An SR22 is a form provided by an insurance company that certifies
coverage and requires the company to notify MVD if it is canceled.
<P>
If you have any additional questions regarding Arizona's mandatory
insurance requirements, contact the Motor Vehicle Division, PO
Box 2100, Mail Drop 535M, Phoenix AZ 85001.

<H3>Arizona's Child Restraint Law (Buckle Up Baby!)</H3>
<P>
A child four years or younger or 40 pounds or less must be properly
secured in a child passenger restraint system while being transported
in a motor vehicle in this state.
<P>
Only non-commercial vehicles (family automobile or van) are affected
by this law. This law does not apply if the vehicle was originally
manufactured without passenger safety belts (prior to 1968), certain
recreational vehicles, commercial vehicles, and when a child is
transported due to an emergency to obtain necessary medical care.
<P>
The driver, when transporting more than one child four years or
younger or 40 pounds or less, must secure as many children in
child passenger restraint devices as are reasonable given the
size of the passenger area and number of passengers being transported.
<P>
Child safety seats must meet US Department of Transportation Safety
Standards and must be used according to the seat manufacturers'
and automobile manufacturers' instructions.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>For a child traveling in a motor vehicle, the most dangerous
place to be is in an adult's arms. It is often called the &quot;child
crusher&quot; position. In a motor vehicle crash of approximately
30 mph, a ten pound infant will be ripped from the adult's arms
with a force of almost 200 pounds. If the adult is unbelted, the
child is likely to be crushed between the adult's body and the
windshield or dashboard.
<BR>
<LI>Less than one-half of one percent of injury-producing motor
vehicle crashes involve fire or submersion in water. Safety seats
can keep children conscious, uninjured, in place, and visible
in the vehicle. Federal standards require that child safety seats
be easy to release even after a serious motor vehicle crash.
<BR>
<LI>Air bags can save lives and prevent serious injuries. They
are intended to be used with safety belts or <STRONG>forward-facing</STRONG>
child safety seats. Infant <STRONG>rear-facing</STRONG> child safety seats
should not be used in seating positions equipped with air bags.
The air bag could hit the back of the safety seat very hard, and
the impact could seriously injure the baby's head and brain.
<BR>
<LI>A child safety seat that has once protected a child in a motor
vehicle crash <STRONG>must</STRONG> be replaced to ensure the child's future
safety. Contact your insurance company regarding replacement.
</UL>
<P>
See an unbuckled child? <STRONG>You can do something . . . </STRONG>call
1-800-505-BABY and provide the vehicle license number/state of
issuance, the city where the violation was witnessed, and where
the child was sitting. The Governor's Office of Highway and Community
Safety will then mail public information and educational materials
on child safety seats to the registered owner of the vehicle.
No citation will be issued or enforcement action taken because
of your call. <STRONG>Remember, Buckle Up Baby!</STRONG> 
<P>
Do you have a child safety seat you no longer need? Bring it to
your local Arizona Automobile Association (AAA) office! Maricopa
County SAFE KIDS Coalition will give it a safety check. If it
passes the safety check, the seat will be given to a family that
cannot afford one.

<H3>What Seat is Best for My Child?</H3>
<P>
Child safety seats are geared to the weight and age of the child.
There are four design groups that are aimed at specific ages and
weights to insure the greatest safety and comfort.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Infant seats:</STRONG> These seats are suited to babies up to 20 pounds
or 9-12 months of age. The infant seat is outmoded once your child
can sit up by himself and should be replaced by a toddler seat.
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Convertible seats:</STRONG> These seats are used from birth until the
child reaches 40 pounds or four years of age. Initially, they
are installed facing the rear of the car in a reclining position.
Once the child can sit up, the seat can be adjusted to face forward
in an upright position.
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Toddler seats:</STRONG> These seats are designed only for children
from 20-40 pounds who can sit up. They will usually fit a child
up to four years of age and are installed facing forward only.
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Booster seats:</STRONG> These seats are designed with either a shield
or arm rests. They utilize the car's lap and shoulder belts to
accommodate a small child and eliminate the danger of injury from
seat belt buckles or shoulder belts that are designed for larger
children and adults. Extra care should given to examine manufacturers'
limits on a child's height and weight.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Arizona's Safety Belt Law (Buckle Up Arizona!)</H3>
<P>
Each front seat occupant of a motor vehicle that is designed to
carry 10 or fewer passengers, manufactured model year 1972 and
thereafter is required to be equipped with a lap and shoulder
belt or a lap belt, and shall have the lap and shoulder belt properly
adjusted and fastened while the vehicle is in motion, or if only
a lap belt is installed where the occupant is sitting, the lap
belt shall be properly adjusted and fastened while the vehicle
is in motion.
<P>
The operator of a motor vehicle subject to the requirements of
the law shall require each front seat passenger under the age
of 16 years to comply with this law.
<UL>
<LI>You are four times more likely to be killed or seriously injured
if you are thrown from your vehicle. The forces in a motor vehicle
collision can be great enough to fling you as far as 150 feet
- about 15 car lengths!
<BR>
<LI>Less than one-half of one percent of all injury producing
motor vehicle collisions involve fire or submersion. If fire or
submersion occurs, you are more likely to be unhurt, alert and
capable of escaping quickly if you are wearing a safety belt.
<BR>
<LI>A combination lap/shoulder belt greatly reduces your chances
of being seriously injured in a motor vehicle crash. The lap belt
prevents ejection and protects your lower body. The shoulder belt
keeps your head and chest from striking the dashboard or windshield.
In vehicles with automatic shoulder belts and manual lap belts,
it is extremely important to buckler the lap belt.
<BR>
<LI>Air bags <STRONG>do not</STRONG> take the place of safety
belts! Even if your vehicle is equipped with air bags, you must
properly &quot;buckle up&quot; to ensure maximum protection during
a motor vehicle crash.

<H2>Motorcycle Safety</H2>
<P>
In Arizona, there are over 140,000 people with a motorcycle operator
license or motorcycle endorsement. There are over 55,000 motorcycles
registered annually. Regardless of whether you ride a moped, motor
scooter or motorcycle you must have a valid operator license.
<P>
<H3>Motorcycle Licensing Requirements</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You must have a valid driver license to operate a motorcycle
on a public road. If you do not have one and are at least 16,
you may apply for a motorcycle license at the nearest driver license
office.
<BR>
<LI>You may apply for a motorcycle instruction permit if you are
at least 15 years and 7 months of age. However, you cannot ride
from sunset to sunrise, and you cannot ride on the freeways (ARS
28-415).
<BR>
<LI>To obtain your motorcycle license for the first time, you
must pass the:
<BR>
<MENU>

<H3>Medical Review Program</H3>
<P>
The Medical Review Program (MRP) is vital to ensure that drivers
are medically, psychologically and physically capable to safely
operate a motor vehicle. The Motor Vehicle Division established
the MRP to ensure the medical eligibility of drivers for licensing.
Both commercial (CDL) and non-commercial drivers are subject to
review.
<P>
Approximately 90,000 commercial drivers are required to submit
the DOT medical long form for review every two years. Non-commercial
drivers are reviewed on an individual basis based on reports received
from the community - concerned citizens, law enforcement officers
and physicians - and from Motor Vehicle Division Customer Service
Representatives. These reports are reviewed by MRP staff to determine
if a licensee requires a re-examination of driving skills, written
testing, or medical or psychological evaluation.
<P>
The Medical Review Program works closely with the Medical Advisory
Board and the Governor's Office for Americans with Disabilities
to establish and update driver licensing standards set forth in
the Arizona Administrative Code. The law enforcement and medical
communities are kept apprised of any changes or updates to these
standards and laws.
<P>
If you know of someone whose driving skills might need to be re-evaluated,
you may contact the Division's Medical Review Program:

<P>
<H3>Traffic Survival School (TSS) Program</H3>
<P>
The Motor Vehicle Division has been the lead agency in administering
the Traffic Survival School Program since 1967. Traffic Survival
Schools, not to be confused with Defensive Driving Schools administered
through the Arizona Courts, are designed to reach individuals
who have exhibited a disregard for traffic laws and the safety
of others. The TSS program attempts to modify the behavior of
these drivers by teaching them how to avoid adverse traffic situations
by increasing their knowledge of Arizona traffic laws, defining
their responsibilities while driving, and most importantly, improving
their attitude toward safe driving. These schools train and assist
errant drivers in the proper attitude and techniques in the operation
of motor vehicles and promote their knowledge of state motor vehiclelaws.
<P>
Arizona licensed drivers accumulating 8-12 points within a 12-month
period are required by Arizona Law to attend Traffic Survival
School. As a result of poor driving behavior, courts frequently
order juveniles to attend the course in order to help establish
a lifetime of safe driving habits. Additionally, courts may refer
traffic violators to a Traffic Survival School as a condition
of sentencing.
<P>
Currently twenty organizations statewide are approved to offer
TSS instruction. The Department has certified 65 individuals to
instruct the course. TSS is available statewide with the exception
of Greenlee and LaPaz counties. The Division is responsible for
evaluation and approval of schools which include examination of
new instructors and audits of training sites and trainers to ensure
compliance with curriculum standards. For information on school
availability, please contact a Traffic Survival School Program
representative at (602) 255-7173.
<P>
<H3>DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE IN ARIZONA</H3>
<P>
In Arizona, it is unlawful to drive or be in physical control
of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Many people believe they cannot be arrested for DUI if their blood
alcohol level is below .10. This is not true! The .10 level is
a statutory level to establish presumption of DUI, but you can
still receive a conviction of DUI if you have any drugs or alcohol
in your system and it can be proven that drugs or alcohol impaired
your ability to operate a vehicle-even if impaired to the slightest
degree. This means a 120 pound person could be under the influence
after only a couple of drinks, depending on the length of time
from the last drink and the test and the amount of food in the
system. If a law enforcement officer administers an alcohol concentration
test and finds the level to be .10 percent or more, the person's
driving privileges will be suspended and withdrawn immediately.
A driver may be found guilty of driving while intoxicated even
though under the level of .10, if they are impaired to the slightest
degree. Refusal to submit or successfully complete a breath, blood
or urine test when required by a law enforcement officer, results
in an automatic loss of driving privileges for 12 months. Criminal
offenses are:

<H2>ARIZONA PORTS OF ENTRY SYSTEM CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</H2>
<P>
Arizona's ports of entry exist to primarily serve the motor carrier
industry and secondly, other highway system users.
<P>
<H3>Composition Of The Ports Of Entry (POEs)</H3>
<P>
The port of entry system is currently comprised of 23 ports. Of
these 23 ports, three are joint ports with adjoining states: St.
George is a single facility occupied by both Arizona and Utah
personnel who are cross-trained; Sanders and San Simon POEs perform
compliance functions for both Arizona and New Mexico commercial
traffic. The New Mexico ports located in Gallup and Lordsburg
perform Arizona outbound and New Mexico inbound compliance functions.
<P>
While all ports of entry generally function within the framework
of standard policies and procedures, variances exist relative
to the age, condition, size, location, and types of equipment
utilized at the various facilities.
<P>
Depending on location and traffic volumes and types, some
ports are operational on a limited basis. Large ports may operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Intermediate
ports may function up to 16 hours per day and work random weekends.
Small ports may operate only one to two shifts each day, with
as few as one employee on duty at any given time. Some of the
larger ports offer multi-agency services. For example, the port
services of Sanders is represented by the Motor Vehicle Division,
Arizona Department of Agriculture and Arizona Department of Public
Safety. In these instances, commercial vehicle operators experience
&quot;one stop shopping,&quot; and are inspected simultaneously
by the three state regulatory agencies for statutory compliance
with Arizona laws and regulations.
<P>
As a result of NAFTA and corresponding legislation recently passed
by the Arizona Legislature, stringent entry requirements have
been imposed on Mexican trucks and busses; the Motor Vehicle Division
has strengthened its operations at all six U.S. Customs ports
along the Arizona-Mexico border. This initiative will provide
Mexican commercial customers concurrent inspection services by
both state and federal agencies to expedite their clearance into
the U.S.

of commercial vehicles to check for safety violations, proper
documentation, and collecting fees.
<LI>Operation of truck scales.
<LI>All vehicles from another state or country applying for Arizona
title and registration must complete a vehicle verification inspection.
These inspections are designated as Level I, routine inspection.
Level II inspections may be conducted to confirm the true identity
of vehicles under the following circumstances if vehicle identification
numbers do not agree with the vehicle title. Other types of inspections
include, but are not limited to:
<MENU>
<LI><STRONG>Abandoned Vehicle Inspections -</STRONG> These are conducted prior to a
vehicle being offered for sale through the abandoned vehicle process.
<LI><STRONG>Bond Title Inspections -</STRONG> These are conducted when an individual
claiming ownership of the vehicle is unable to provide satisfactory
evidence of ownership of the vehicle.
<LI><STRONG>Reconstructed Vehicle Inspections - </STRONG>These are conducted on a vehicle
which is normally put together with major components from different
vehicles and which cannot be properly identified by use of any
of the vehicle identification numbers. An Arizona VIN is most
often assigned in these cases.
<LI><STRONG>Specially Constructed Vehicle Inspection -</STRONG> This inspection is required
for vehicles classified as &quot;Kit Cars&quot; or &quot;Replicas.&quot;
These inspections determine the origin and ownership of all parts
used in the construction of the vehicle and this information is
recorded on the inspection sheet. An Arizona VIN is placed on
the vehicle and title issued.
<LI>Restored Salvage Vehicle Inspections - These in depth inspections
closely examine parts used to reconstruct the vehicle and the
documents indicating origin of component parts.

<LI>MVFOs work with Arizona's citizens in vehicle registration
compliance. This will take the form of accepting reports from
citizens, and working with local law enforcement agencies to issuing
Warning Notices to vehicle owners who have expired registrations
or to individuals who are Arizona residents but have failed to
obtain Arizona license plates and registration.

<P>
<H2>MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION THIRD PARTY PROGRAM</H2>
<P>
The Third Party Program coordinates the expansion of the Motor
Vehicle Division service by overseeing the authorization and integration
of other public and private entities as Motor Vehicle Division-type
service providers called third parties. This program not only
authorizes third parties to perform Motor Vehicle Division functions,
but carefully monitors the quality and productivity of third party
activities in an effort to improve customer service and encourage
a competitive environment. Several areas of the Motor Vehicle
Division are already successfully utilizing the skills and services
of third parties (i.e. oversize-overweight permit issuance,
and motor carrier tax licensing and reporting) and other areas
are currently developing plans for the expansion of third party
opportunities.
<P>
<H3>Commercial Driver License (CDL) Third Party Testers</H3>
<P>
CDL Third Party Testers are being used in increasing numbers to
administer the demonstration skill tests for applicants seeking
commercial driver licenses. These third parties combine their
knowledge and skills with the training the Division provides to
ensure that commercial driver licenses are issued only to those
with the proper skills. The flexible schedules and high quality
testing offered through this extensive statewide program provides
a valuable service to the public in general and the motor carrier
industry in particular. Contact person: Ms. Blanca Ruiz (602)
255-8389.
<P>
<H3>Third Party Driver License</H3>
<P>
Because of the Third Party Program, Arizonans seeking a driver
license will soon be able to meet all driver licensing requirements
without ever stepping inside a Motor Vehicle Division office.
Currently, the written test, road test, and vision test are all
being conducted statewide by authorized third party contractors.
Such competitive third party services will offer customers improved
and exceptional personalized service. These third party &quot;<I>testers</I>&quot;
ensure that the required knowledge and operating skills of applicants
meet state standards prior to driver license issuance. This partnership
between third parties and Motor Vehicle Division ensures that
quality testing continues even as our state rapidly grows without
increasing the burden to taxpayers or increasing the workforce
of the Motor Vehicle Division.
<P>
By late 1996, Motor Vehicle Division customers will also be able
to opt for other driver license services from third parties such
as application processing and renewal. These third party &quot;processors&quot;
will be able to prepare and process all the necessary documents
leading to the issuance of most driving credentials. Once again,
the use of third parties will improve customer service by offering
a competitive environment where customers can be served where
and how they choose. The contact person is Ms. Mary Williams (602) 255-7079.
<P>
<H3>Third Party Title and Registration (T &R)</H3>
<P>
Third Party Title and Registration allows authorized third parties
to provide certain vehicle title and registration functions previously
only performed by the Motor Vehicle Division. For these services,
authorized public and private entities are given access to the
Division's title and registration database for the purpose of
processing and issuing vehicle titles, plates, tabs, and registrations
to their customers. These third parties greatly benefit Arizonans
not only by servicing their customers quickly and performing work
that was previously reserved for state employees, but also by
collecting fees and valuable tax dollars that are targeted for
highway and freeway construction. The contact person is Ms. Lenor Stewart
(602) 255-7969.
<P>
<H3>Third Party Inspection</H3>
<P>
As part of the Third Party T & R effort, many authorized public
and private entities are taking advantage of the opportunity to
conduct their own vehicle identification number inspections. Because
of this program, customers throughout the state who are seeking
to register or title an out-of-state vehicle are not longer required
to wait in line for an available Motor Vehicle Division inspector.
Instead, many are using certified third party inspectors who have
been authorized to provide certain vehicle inspections. As a result,
highly trained Motor Vehicle Division inspectors are increasingly
able to concentrate on more advanced inspections, while our third
parties conduct the routine, yet important, simple inspections.
Once again, Arizona and state employees benefit. The contact person is 
Ms. Lenor Stewart (602) 255-7969.

<P>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>What is &quot;mandatory insurance&quot;?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Arizona law requires that all vehicles registered in this
state be covered by certain minimum levels of insurance, and that
proof of insurance (Arizona insurance identification card) be
carried in the vehicle at all times.  Insurance information is
also to be filed with the Motor Vehicle Division.  Minimum levels
of insurance, as required by law, are $15,000/$30,000 death or
bodily injury and $10,000 property damage.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What happens if I don't get insurance?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Your vehicle registration and license plates will be suspended. If the vehicle is stopped by law enforcement while under suspension,
the individual will be ticketed and the plates confiscated.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Will my out-of-state insurance be acceptable for Arizona?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>No - all vehicles registered in Arizona must be insured
by an agency licensed to do business in this state (ARS 28-1253.A).
 Arizona residents who are out of state (including military personnel),
however, may submit a &quot;de-insurance&quot; form on a vehicle
on a short-term basis.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How long do I have to get insurance once I register my
vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Insurance is required immediately, before driving the vehicle.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>What is &quot;de-insurance&quot; and how do I de-insure
my vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>De-insurance is a method of temporarily not maintaining
the required insurance on the vehicle until it is ready to be
driven or placed on the road again.  A de-insured vehicle will
not be suspended due to lack of insurance unless it is driven
on the roadways of this state.</EM>
<P>
<EM>To de-insure your vehicle, contact the Motor Vehicle Division
at (602)255-0072 and request the appropriate form. Once you have
completed and submitted the form, the information will be entered
onto the vehicle record.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>I received a notice that my plates and registration were
suspended - why?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>A suspension could have been generated for one of several
reasons:</EM>
<MENU>
<LI>no proof of Arizona insurance
<LI>lapse in insurance coverage
<LI>no insurance on file
<LI>accident case
<LI>newly registered vehicle may not have been on system when
insurance information was received
<LI>VIN (vehicle identification number) error, either entered
into the system incorrectly or provided incorrectly by the insurance
company
</MENU>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>My vehicle is being restored - I dropped the insurance,
and now the registration is suspended. What do I do?
</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Complete a de-insured certification form. Once restoration
is complete, get proof of insurance, complete a non-use affidavit
and apply for registration. We also recommend that you retain
receipts showing parts purchased; they may be required to document
the periods of non-use.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Why isn't my insurance on file, when I provided it at the
time I registered my vehicle?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>State law requires the insurance company and the owner
to submit proof of Arizona insurance within 30 days after initial
registration. Insurance companies are also required to routinely
notify the Division of all policy cancellations, renewals and
new issuances. Sometimes, there is a lapse between the reported
cancellation of one company and the new issuance of another. 
For this reason, the owner should also send a copy of their insurance
card to MVD for initial registrations and whenever a policy is
changed.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How can I clear a registration suspension?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Provide proof of Arizona insurance at the time of the suspension.
 If proof cannot be obtained, an SR-22 must be obtained from an 
Arizona-authorized insurance company and a $50.00 reinstatement
fee must be paid. The SR-22 must be maintained for three years
from the date of suspension with no lapse in coverage.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>When I provide proof of insurance, when will my plates
and registration be reinstated?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Immediately (or within an hour), provided the information
submitted is adequate and meets the requirements of the law. 
Also, the customer must ensure the information is sent to the
representative they spoke with to guarantee immediate reinstatement
of plates and registration.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Where is the nearest office that I can go to and give insurance
information?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>You may go to your nearest MVD Auto License facility. 
By calling (602)255-0072 a customer service representative 
can give you the address for your local facility, or see the </EM>
<A HREF="/mvd/mvdhrs.htm">Office Locations and Hours</A><EM> listing for the one nearest you.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>I submitted the necessary information; why did I get another
notice stating my plates and registration are suspended?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>The information you sent may not have been received; the
vehicle identification number may have been incorrect on the document
sent in; insurance information submitted may not cover the time
of suspension; documents may have crossed in the mail; or out-of-state
insurance may have been provided when Arizona proof of insurance
was required.</EM>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>I was in an accident and the other driver did not have
insurance; can you provide me with their insurance information?</STRONG>
<BR>
No, confidentiality laws prohibit release of that information.
 However, if an accident did occur and proof of insurance was
not available or was not valid, an accident insurance verification
packet can be completed, and insurance information can be obtained
in this manner. There is a $3.00 fee for this service upon completion
of the investigation (see Question #14).
<P>
<LI><STRONG>How can I obtain an accident insurance verification packet,
and how does it work?</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>Contact the Division at (602)255-0072 and request that we
mail you a packet. Once the appropriate forms have been completed
and submitted, we will initiate an investigation. Upon completion,
if information is available, you will be notified to send the
$3.00 fee for release of the information.</EM>
<P>
<EM>If no information is available, you will be so advised. In this
event, it is probably in your best interest to file a civil suit
with the Clerk of the Superior Court and obtain a judgment. You
can then file the judgment with MVD, and we will suspend the individual's
driving privileges until the judgment is satisfied with the court.</EM>

        <p>After you install Project Estimate, you can begin
        working right away. Project Estimate can be used to
        create estimates containing partial or total project
        cost. A estimate is a collection of construction
        materials which defines the cost of each item and total
        cost of the project. This provides the user with the
        ability to quickly and easily determine the cost of any
        Construction Item as well as the entire Project. </p>
        <p>NOTE: If you are new to using a graphical user
        interface such as Microsoft Windows or Windows NT, see
        your Microsoft Windows or Windows NT System Guide for a
        summary of the basic procedures you need to know. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The biggest change to this version is that most of the
        dialog boxes are within a large window, all part of the
        Project Estimate application itself. These are called MDI
        Child dialog boxes. This change comes with our newest
        version of our programming language. This allows the user
        to resize the main application window to any size they
        wish and all the dialog boxes will stay within Project
        Estimate&#146;s window. The Save As, Open and Print
        dialog boxes fall outside the Project Estimate window
        because we are now making calls directly to the Microsoft
        Windows system to open them. </p>
        <p>This version will create both English or metric
        estimates. </p>
        <p>Changes have also been made for the application to run
        over a network and accept network drive options. </p>
        <p>This version and all future versions will follow the
        Microsoft Visual Design Guide provided to us by
        Microsoft. This will help our applications to remain
        current with the trend in the software industry.
        Following the Microsoft Visual Design Guide has made
        several changes to the interface itself, including the
        removal of button menus for all commands and the move to
        menus and buttons as found in Microsoft Word and Excel,
        including a status bar along the bottom where you will
        now find the totals. </p>
        <p>The &#147;View Item&#148; function has been removed
        and replaced with a Search Item List function that was
        included in a early version of Project Estimate. The
        Search feature that we had placed in the old version was
        found to be to slow and memory intensive on the 386
        PC&#146;s Roadway Design was using at the time so it was
        removed. Now that we have 486 PC&#146;s, the search times
        are within acceptable limits. A search was made for all
        items with &#147;concrete&#148; in the text, there were
        867 items in the Item List that matched and the search
        was completed in a little under 10 seconds to call up ALL
        867 items for the user to scroll through. </p>
        <p>The user may now change the Engineering Cost.</p>

<p>The following information describes the computer systems and
software used to create the Roadway Design Web page. </p>

<p><img src="images/gold%20SepBar.jpg" width="471" height="9"></p>

<h4>HTML Editor</h4>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Frontpage Explorer</a>
        for Web page creation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Graphic Software</h4>

<ul>
    <li>All our images were created using <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> Image
        Composer, <a href="http://www.povray.org/">Persistence of
        Vision Ray Tracer</a> 3.0 (POV-RAY) for Windows NT and
        Microsoft Paint. We tried to stay with images that gave a
        3D look and feel. Please remember that all our images are
        covered under the Arizona Department of Transportation
        copyright.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Audio Software</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The audio voice clip on our home page was recorded using
        the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>
        Sound Recorder for Windows NT ver. 4.0 (Build 1381). The
        voice was provided by Toni Williams, a Arizona Department
        of Transportation, Roadway Design Section full time
        employee. Please remember that all our sounds are covered
        under the Arizona Department of Transportation copyright.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hardware for HTML Editing</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The pages are created on a local Web Server. The original
        Web Server was a <a
        href="http://www-es.compaq.com:80/cgi-bin/present/graphics/productinfo/desktopinfo/prodbull/deskproxe.ev.html">Compaq
        Deskpro XL Pentium/60</a> with 16MB RAM, 540MB HD running <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/products/ntserv/default.htm">Microsoft
        Windows NT Server 3.51</a>. We have since upgraded to a <a
        href="http://hpcc998.external.hp.com:80/gpcd/Products/V-Line/vt6index.html">Hewlett
        Packard Vectra VT Pentium Pro/150</a> with 32MB RAM, 1.2G
        HD running <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/catalog/products/ntserv/default.htm">Microsoft
        Windows NT Server 4.0</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Hardware for Web pages</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The Web pages reside on Arizona Department of
        Transportation's Gateway Server, which is a <a
        href="http://www.sun.com/products-n-solutions/hw/servers/product/4-5-20/wg.5.posit.html">Sun
        Sparc 20</a> running SunOS 4.1.3.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Overview </h4>

<p>Most of the above links to other home pages are direct links
to where the information that is being discussed can be found.
When designing our Web pages, we have tried to keep in mind that
a large number of users are accessing the Web via a 14.4k modem,
which can make searching around within a Web page for information
very time consuming. We have also tried to keep image sizes down
to a minimum where possible. Many sites I have visited seem to
have images that are very large (+/-70k), so we have tried to
keep them around 3k. A few images are up around the 20k size, but
that was as small as we could get them without losing the
information that we are trying to convey.</p>

<U><I>Tips for preparing a resume that computers can read.<BR>
</I></U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>NEW TECHNOLOGY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There's a new technology that could be very helpful to you.  It
could help you find your next job.  It's called electronic applicant
tracking, and it's being used by leading organizations in both
the public and private sectors.<BR>

<P>
By using the latest in document imaging technology, your resume
can be scanned into a computer system and kept &quot;alive&quot;
for a long period of time.  In our system, your resume will be
kept active (alive) for six months.  The computer can search for
just about anything in your resume.  You could be qualified and
considered for jobs you never thought of.  The computer can make
it easier for you to be considered for more jobs, and it keeps
your <U>one</U> resume on file so it's quicker to update your
information.<BR>

<P>
Here's how it works.  Your resume is scanned into the computer
as an image.  Then OCR (optical character recognition) software
looks at the image to distinguish every letter and number (character)
and creates a text file (ASCII).  Then artificial intelligence
&quot;reads&quot; the text and extracts the important information
about you such as your name, address, phone number, work history,
years of experience, education, and skills.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>NEW OPPORTUNITY<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Why is it important for you to know this?  When you prepare a
resume for the computer to read, you want it to be &quot;scannable&quot;.
 A scannable resume is clean so the scanner can get a clear image.
 A scannable resume has standard fonts and crisp, dark type such
as a laser printer or a typewriter with a new ribbon would produce,
so the OCR can recognize every letter. A scannable resume
has plenty of facts for the artificial intelligence to extract.
 <U>The more skills and facts you provide, the more opportunities
you'll have for your skills to match available positions.<BR>
</U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>A SCANNABLE RESUME:<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Maximizes the computer's ability to &quot;read&quot; your resume.
<LI>Maximizes your ability to get &quot;hits&quot; (a hit is when one of your skills matches a skill 
for which the computer is searching).<BR>
</UL>
Preparing a scannable resume is easy.  Like the traditional style
resume, you focus on format and content.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>FORMAT<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
To maximize the computer's ability to read your resume, provide
a clean, clear resume in a standard resume format.  The computer
can extract skills from many styles of resume including chronological
(list your <U>jobs in order by date</U>, with your current/most
recent job first), functional (organized by skills), and any combination
of these styles.<BR>

<P>
The most difficult resume for the computer to read is a poor quality
copy with an unusual layout, such as a newspaper layout, adjusted
spacing, large font sizes, lines/graphics, type that is too light,
or paper that is too dark.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR BETTER SCANNABILITY<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use white or light colored 8-1/2 x 11 paper, printed on <U>one
side only</U>, with 1-1/2 inch margins.
<LI>Use a laser printed original if possible.  A typewritten original,
a letter quality dot matrix, or a high quality photocopy is also
OK.
<LI>Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, bullets and
boxes.
<LI>Don't condense spacing between letters or lines.
<LI>Use <B>bold face </B>and/or ALL CAPITAL LETTERS for section
headings as long as the letters don't touch each other.
<LI>Use standard typefaces such as <FONT FACE="Arial">Arial</FONT>,
Futura, Optima, Univers, Times New Roman, Palatino, Aquiline Book,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Courier</FONT></TT>, with a font
size of 10 to 14 points.  (Avoid Times 10 point.)
<LI>Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, <U>underline, </U>shadows,
and reverses (white letters on black background).
<LI>Avoid two-column formats or resumes that look like newspapers
or newsletters.
<LI>Place your name at the <U>top</U> of the page <U>on its own
line</U>.  (Your name should also be the first text that appears
on subsequent pages.)
<LI>Use a standard address format below your name and list each
phone number on its own line.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>CONTENT<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The computer extracts information from your resume.  You can use
your current resume; however, once you understand what the computer
searches for, you may wish to include <U>key words</U> to increase
your opportunities for matching requirements or getting &quot;hits&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
Employment staff access the resume database in many ways, searching
for applicants with specific backgrounds.  When searching for
specific backgrounds, they will search for key words, usually
nouns such as writing, BA, marketing, programming administration,
counseling, RN, bilingual, Spanish (language fluency), etc.  So
make sure that you describe your education and experience with
concrete words rather than vague descriptions.  The computer system
will extract the words and information from your sentences.  <U>You
can write your resume as usual.<BR>
</U>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR MAXIMIZING &quot;HITS&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use enough key words to define your skills, experience, education,
professional affiliations, etc.  
<LI>Describe your experience with concrete words rather than vague
descriptions.  For example, it's better to use <B>&quot;managed
a team doing software engineering&quot;</B> than &quot;responsible
for managing, training&#133;&quot;
<LI><U><B>Use more than one page if necessary</B></U>.  The computer
can easily handle multiple page resumes, and it uses all of the
information it extracts from your resume to determine if your
skills match available positions.  It allows you to provide more
information than you would for a human reader.
<LI>Use jargon and acronyms specific to your industry, but remember
to spell out acronyms for human readers.
<LI>Increase your list of key words by including specifics, for
example, list the names of software you use such as WordPerfect,
Microsoft Word, Lotus 1-2-3, Fox Pro, etc.  Remember, however,
that the system has a limit to the amount of information that
it can extract from your resume.  Therefore, you may wish to place
more important information near the beginning of your resume.
<LI>Use typical resume headings such as:  Objective, Experience,
Employment, Work History, Positions held, Appointments, Skills,
Summary, Summary of Qualifications, Accomplishments, Strengths,
Education, Professional Affiliations, Publications, Papers, Licenses,
Certifications, Examinations, Honors, Personal, Additional, Miscellaneous,
References, etc.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Some people may want to have <U>two</U> versions of their resume,
one with a scannable format and detailed information for the computer
to read (<U>send this one</U>) and one with a creative layout,
enhanced typography, and summarized information to carry to the
interview for people to read.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=4>SUMMARY</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>TIPS FOR PREPARING AN EFFECTIVE SCANNABLE RESUME:
<BR>
</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>Use <U>white</U> or <U>light colored</U> standard <U>letter
size paper</U>.
<LI>Make sure the resume you submit is <U>clean and clearly readable</U>.
<LI>Use <U>standard typefaces</U> between <U>10 and 14 points</U>
in size.
<LI>Place your <U>name at the top of the page</U>, use a <U>standard
format for your address</U>, and place <U>each phone number</U>
you list <U>on a separate line</U>.
<LI>Describe your background in <U>detail</U> using <U>concrete</U>,
<U>key words</U> rather than vague, fuzzy descriptions.
<LI><U>Use as many pages as you need</U> to provide a clear and
detailed description of your background.
<LI>Use any <U>standard</U> resume format.

<STRONG>A hole at the top of a bridge</STRONG> is used to dump dirt into a truck below.  This was a much faster method of loading dirt than with a shovel.  Teams of horses and mules were used on highway construction projects into the 1930's.  Motorized equipment made its debut in the 1920's, but it took a couple of decades to convert completely to modem equipment.

<H1>75 mph speed limit effective Tuesday, December 3, on I-19
</H1>

<P>
(December 2, 1996) - The 75 mph speed limit will become effective
on I-19 south of Green Valley on Tuesday, December 3, but motorists
are being warned they will have to drive slower through an 18-mile
construction project in the Green Valley area, according to the
Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).
<P>
An ADOT sign crew will be converting 21 speed limit signs to 75
mph beginning at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will have the work between
Green Valley and Nogales (Milepost 44.05 to Milepost 3.21) completed
by early afternoon.
<P>
However, Dave Cummings, an ADOT resident engineer based in Tucson,
said the speed limit will be reduced to 65 mph when paving starts
about December 10 between the Green Valley and Chavez traffic
interchanges (Milepost 42.5 to 25.3).
<P>
Cummings said the speed limit will be reduced even further to
45 mph through a moving four-mile work zone within the project
limits. The speed limit will be enforced by the Department of
Public Safety, he said.
<P>
The work hours will be from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
The resurfacing project, which will cover all four lanes and the
shoulders, will be completed in late spring.
<P>
ADOT announced last September that the speed limit would be raised
on about 41 miles of I-19 between Green Valley and Nogales. However,
sign installation was delayed by equipment problems and the need
for sign crew members to reorganize their materials yard to make
way for a sign fabrication building.
<P>
The speed limit on 14 miles of I-19 between Tucson and Green Valley
(Milepost 55 to 41) was raised to 75 mph last December.
<P>
The speed limit will remain 65 mph in the Green Valley area between
Duval Mine Road and Canoa Road.

<font size=+3 color=#8b2252><Strong>w</Strong></font>hen it comes to landscaping on the Valley's regional freeway system, the question is one of colors.  How do we keep our freeways green without leaving the budget in the red? How can we balance the obligation to screen neighborhoods from noise and air pollution with the need to maintain cost sensitive landscapes?<p>
Faced with a limited budget to pay for attractive roadscapes, the Arizona Department of Transportation is working to answer these questions with a thrifty, yet engaging, freeway landscape program that beautifies our highways without breaking the bank.<p>
With just $1.2 billion left to build more than 70 miles of urban freeways in the Valley, scarce dollars must be largely directed toward opening more lanes to reduce congestion and facilitate the Valley's rapidly growing population.<p>

</td>

</table>

Thanks to the work of a team of public and private sector participants, the challenge soon will be met as recommendations developed through a year's worth of hard work will start to be noticed in a pair of Valley landscape projects scheduled to begin this fall.<p>
On the new Sky Harbor Expressway, plans call for low maintenance cactus and wildflowers to accent native Hohokam and Hopi designs that recall past cultures.  These designs will include icons depicting ancient Native American art found on petroglyphs, pottery and baskets.<p>
Where ADOT might have spent $26,000 per acre to beautify his airport route just a few years ago, plans suggest it will only cost $19,000 per acre-a substantial savings that still yields pleasing results and provides a reduction of maintenance expenses by about 50 percent.  Future projects will be designed to deliver similar cost savings.<p>
A little southeast of the new Sky Harbor Expressway, ADOT is following another recommendation of its team: salvaging trees to save taxpayer money.<p>
More than 100 large trees planted along both sides of Interstate 10 in the late 1970's now are being moved from the path of freeway construction to a new home inside the I-10 Superstition Freeway traffic interchange.<p>
The trees will be spared a trip to the mulch pile and taxpayers will save thousands of dollars, since plants of similar size and quality could cost up to $4,000 each.  Compare the cost of the salvage operation, about $162,000, with the cost of new trees, up to $400,000, and the benefits are crystal clear!<p>
Sharing the cost of freeway landscape projects also will help coveted freeway dollars last longer.  Governor Fife Symington was the first to call on Valley communities to divide landscaping responsibilities, and several cities have since answered the challenge.  Today, ADOT has cooperative agreements with Glendale, Chandler and Phoenix to spread the cost of landscape construction and maintenance.<p>
As each new idea is tried and tested along our Valley freeway system, taxpayers will find ADOT delivering realistic freeway landscaping alternatives that make the roadsides inviting and save public dollars.

intersection built at University Drive, and leads 
motorists to the Hohokam Expressway (SR 143) and 
Interstate 10.
<P>During the construction, commuters are experiencing some major changes in 
their routes to and from the airport area.  The 
temporary extension of Air Lane between 44th Street and the Hohokam Expressway has 
been permanently closed while crews work to 
replace <BR>
that route with a new link between Air Lane and the Sky Harbor Expressway.
<P>The closures are needed to allow construction to move ahead on a new loop ramp 
from westbound Sky Harbor Boulevard to southbound SR 143.
<P>The $20 million construction project is a joint effort between ADOT and the City of

Eleven new miles of freeway opening

<P>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><Strong>W</Strong></font>ith 11 new miles of freeway opening in the Valley, it's clear that ADOT's construction program is moving full speed ahead.<p>
These additional miles are the result of the Governor's Freeway Plan to reprioritize and accelerate construction on all corridors set into motion in December of 1994.  One of the major goals of the Governor's plan is to complete the Loop 101 outer loop to full freeway standards.  Two of these fall openings move ADOT closer to that goal, while another helps relieve congestion for airport commuters.<p></td>
The first freeway opening of the fall was the extension of the Sky Harbor Expressway (SR 153). This 1.29 mile segment of Sky Harbor Expressway was designed to provide airport area travelers and commuters with a convenient route into and out of the east side of Sky Harbor International Airport.<p>
The SR 153 now spans from Washington Street to University Drive with an interchange at Sky Harbor Boulevard.  The expressway serves as an alternate route across the Salt River.<p>
Resident Engineer Ebbie Attar oversaw the $20 million project with contractor Kiewit Western Company to completion.<p>
"This project was particularly demanding due to the challenges of working around the airport," explained Attar.  "Construction schedules and detours required special planning to keep airport traffic moving, especially during the Super Bowl."
The Sky Harbor Expressway opened on September 16, following a dedication ceremony held out on the freeway.<p>
The first segment of the Pima Freeway (Loop 101) from the Red Mountain Freeway (Loop 202) interchange north to Thomas Road opened to traffic on October 18. The 5 mile segment is the first portion of what will be a major north/south route in the east Valley, connecting Scottsdale with Tempe, Mesa and Chandler.  This $52 million project being constructed by Ball, Ball and Brosamer, features ramps at Rio Salado Parkway and interchanges at McKellips Road, McDowell Road and Thomas Road.<p>
"The construction of the first portion of the Pima Freeway has been a unique experience because it is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community," explains Mike Loo, resident engineer for ADOT.  "We have worked closely with the Indian Community to make this project happen.  The result is a freeway with features that highlight the Native American culture."<p>
With the opening of the mainline, the Red Mountain Interchange ramp connecting southbound Pima Freeway with the westbound Red Mountain Freeway will open, taking motorists from Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix.  The ramp from eastbound Red Mountain Freeway to northbound Pima Freeway is expected to open by March of 1997.  Other ramps of the interchange will open in phases through 1999.<p>
By mid-November, the 5.5 mile extension of the Agua Freeway (Loop 101) will open to motorists in the northwest Valley.  The Agua Fria Freeway project extends the Loop 101 from 75th Avenue to 35th Avenue along Beardsley Road.  This project was accelerated under the Governor's Freeway Plan in order to connect the 10 miles of the Agua Fria that have been open since 1990 with Interstate 17.  Resident Engineer Julio Alvarado is overseeing this $20 million project built by Sundt Corp.<p>
By early 1997, two of the ramps connecting the Agua Fria with I-17 will be completed.  Those freeway-to-freeway connections opening early next year are: the ramp connecting westbound Loop 101 with southbound I-17 and the ramp connecting southbound I-17 with westbound Loop 101. The remaining ramps of the west half of the Loop 101/I-17 interchange will open in phases from summer to fall of 1997.

<TD>
&#40; October 30, 1996&#41; - You've probably traveled the Apache Trail and driven on remaining sections of U.S. 66, but have you ever heard of the Reno Road?<p>

	New found interest in identifying and preserving historic roads made the discovery of the Reno Road a few years ago a major find--major enough to stop design work for a few months on a $29.6 million widening project on the Beeline Highway.<p>

	The Reno Road is a 30-mile military wagon road constructed in the 1870's between Fort McDowell on what is now the Beeline Highway and Camp Reno near what is now Roosevelt Lake.<p>

	Vegetation had all but covered up the road when it was discovered during an environmental assessment for widening the Beeline Highway between Sycamore Creek and Sunflower.  However, the road was visible from along its alignment or from the air.<p>

	Because it is considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, engineers had to change the design for the Beeline Highway widening project to avoid well-preserved sections of the Reno Road.<p>

	Now the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) is embarking on a three-year effort to locate and document all historic roads in the state.<p>
	
	"The study will not only alert engineers to historically significant roads when planning new and wider highways, but also will provide new ways to explore and appreciate Arizona's past," said Bob Gasser, who is coordinating the ADOT study.<p>

	ADOT recently signed a $50,000 agreement with Dames & Moore, an international engineering consulting firm with offices in Phoenix, to come up with a plan to identify all historic roads in the state and to document about a half-dozen examples of which ones should be preserved.  The examples will come from different eras from the Spanish exploration to the 1950's.<p>
	The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act provides for the evaluation of roads, structures, bridges and other facilities that are 50 years old or older to determine if they should be added to the National Register of Historic Places.  While historic roads like the Apache Trail and U.S. 66 have been designated and marked over the years, a comprehensive review of historic roads is relatively new and is designed to not only document what is known, but also discover what is unknown.<p>

	The one-year Dames & Moore study will build on a 1994 survey of state and federal agencies and museums to identify Arizona's historic roads.  It also will search out other sources, such as university professors and armchair historians, to identify additional roads and to provide documentation when ADOT moves into the second phase of the study in early 1998.<p>

	The second phase of the study will be a two-year effort to identify and document all historic roads in the state and to make recommendations on which roads should be placed on the National Register of Historic Places.<p>

	ADOT will apply for federal funds in late 1997 to finance the second phase of the study.<p>

	Meanwhile, ADOT is looking for more people like Stuart Roseberg, a research editor at Arizona Highways, who heard about the study and volunteered information on the old Black Canyon Highway that he had gathered while doing a master's thesis at ASU.<p>

	"We want the public to recommend roads and to identify themselves as being knowledgeable about roads," said Gasser, who has 25 years of experience in the field.<p>

	Once Arizona's list of historic roads is on the National Register of Historic Places, Gasser anticipates that state and federal agencies that have jurisdiction over the land where the roads are located will develop a network of signs, markings and information boards to provide background for people interested in Arizona history.<p>

	"Different agencies probably will be developing the roads for interpretation and modern adaptive re-use," Gasser said.  "Just seeing the interest in Route 66 will lead to similar interest in other roads."<p>

Gas fumes can cause ozone when heated by Arizona&#146;s hot sun.  Gas that is not burned completely in a cars combustion process produces carbon monoxide. 
This car eliminates these problems by replacing gasoline with electricity. <p>
As of 1996, the big three auto manufacturers have been working on electric car programs as well.  Their goal was to find an electric car model that duplicates the gasoline model we use today.  For example, US auto makers, battery manufacturers and electronic companies formed &#147;consortiums&#148; to develop batteries that will allow up to 200 miles of driving between charges.  Some of these models will be available to the public soon.<p>
The Federal Clean Air Standards  consider electric cars zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) because they run so clean.  Other ZEV&#146;s include solar and hydrogen powered cars.  It is estimated that by the year 2001, more than four million ZEV&#146;s will be on America&#146;s roads.<p>
This program is just one of many ways that ADOT is planning for Arizona&#146;s future in transportation.

<H1>Christmas week travel a concern for A.D.O.T., December 19<BR>
</H1>

<P>
(December 19, 1996) - Christmas is falling on a Wednesday for the first time in five years and the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) is warning motorists to be extra cautious for the nine-day period beginning Saturday, December 21.

<p>Jim Williams, supervisor of ADOT's Traffic Records Section, said travel will be up throughout Christmas week, beginning Saturday, December 21, and ending Sunday, December 29.

<p>While official holiday accident statistics will be kept for only Christmas Day, Williams said the risk of accidents, injuries and fatalities will be high throughout the nine-day period.

<p>He said when Christmas fell on a Wednesday in 1991, there were 1,360 injuries and 22 fatalities on Arizona streets and highways for the nine-day period from the Saturday before Christmas to the Sunday after Christmas.

<p>Christmas Day itself was relatively safe in 1991.  There were 22 injuries and no fatalities.

<p>Williams said there will be a lot of distance driving during Christmas week as Arizonans travel throughout the state and into neighboring states to visit relatives and friends.

<p>Motorists should make sure they allow enough time for travel, including extra time for inclement weather, and take periodic breaks to reduce fatigue, Williams said.  The phone number for road conditions in Arizona is 241-3100 Ext. 7623.

<p>Additionally, it's important not to exceed the speed limit and not to mix drinking and driving, he added.

<p>Travel will not be as great during New Year's week, Williams said, as motorists are expected to remain closer to home.  However, the revelry on New Year's Eve always raises the danger of encountering impaired drivers, he said.  

<p>Williams said ADOT encourages Arizonans to designate a driver for the ride home if drinking will be involved while ringing in the new year.  New Year's Eve also is the busiest night of the year for taxi drivers, who are readily available to transport revelers home from celebrations.  Some taxi companies have designated phone numbers that bartenders can call for patrons who should not drive.

<p>Five years ago, there were three fatalities and 118 injuries during the 30-hour period from 6 p.m. New Year's Eve to midnight New Year's Day.

They certainly do.  Every year ADOT spends $1 million on average removing litter from Arizona&#146;s 6,100 miles of highway.  That adds up to a lot of trash.  Sixty tons of litter are removed weekly from the Phoenix metro area alone.

&#40; October 30, 1996&#41; - The Squaw Peak Freeway is being fitted with a new technology that listens for passing vehicles to determine how traffic is flowing, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).  <p>

	ADOT will use Passive Acoustical Detectors (PADS) between Thomas and Glendale roads as an alternative to the "loop detectors" buried beneath other Valley freeways to help detect traffic congestion and emergencies.<p>

  	Because this five mile stretch of freeway is not equipped with buried sensors, the technology enables ADOT to expand its freeway management system to the Squaw Peak without causing delays.<p>  

	The PADS system is based on acoustic technology that was developed for the U.S. Navy.  A series of microphones listens to vehicles as they pass by to monitor traffic volumes and average speeds in each lane.<p>

	The microphone panels will be mounted overhead on existing bridges, poles, and signs.  The system will be in operation by next spring as ADOT completes a 12.5 mile expansion of its existing freeway management system. <p> 

	A test site on I-10 at 19th Avenue compared the traffic data that was collected by the PADS system with data from loop detectors.  The results found that PADS accurately compiled the same information as loop detectors. <p> 

	ADOT's use of PADS on the Squaw Peak Freeway is one of the longest sections of road in the country to use this advanced technology. <p>

<P>
<h2>Ethernet History</h2>
Ethernet was developed at the Xerox PARC research
center by Robert Metcalfe , David Boggs and others.
<P>
The original LAN was based on a common cable, carrier
sensing mechanism. This first LAN supported a distance of 1 kilometer
with 100 workstations at a sustained data rate of 2.94 Mbps. The
LAN technology was named &quot;Ethernet&quot; in reference to
the metaphysical substance through which electromagnetic waves
propogate.
<P>
The Ethernet standard was proposed by Digital Equipment
Corporation, Intel, and Xerox.  The first Ethernet standard was
published in September 1981 and was called the DIX 1.0. DIX stands
for Digital (Digital Equipment Corporation), Intel, and Xerox.
 The second revision,  DIX 2.0, was  published in November 1982.
<BR>

<P>
The IEEE started project 802 to standardize LAN architectures.
Digital, Intel, and Xerox proposed the adoption of Ethernet as
a standard.  IBM proposed the Token Ring as a standard.  The Ethernet
proposal became IEEE 802.3, and the Token Ring proposal became
IEEE 802.5.<BR>

<P>
In the usual case of design by committee. The 802.3
standard is slightly different from Ethernet. However, it is common
to use the term Ethernet and 802.3 to mean the same thing. We'll
point out any differences when needed. <BR>

<P>
<h2>Theory of Operation</h2>

<P>
Ethernet stations use a &quot;listen before talking&quot;
protocol. Electrical activity on an ethernet line indicates a
station is transmitting data. This electrical activity is called
&quot;carrier&quot;. Another station that wants to transmit will
listen to the carrier and wait for a pause.
<P>
After the last bit of the passing data frame, the
Ethernet data link layer standard requires the station to wait
for a minimum of 9.6 microseconds for interframe spacing. The
station will then commence transmission.<BR>

<P>
Because many stations are attached to a common Ethernet
cable and  use the carrier-sense mechanism, Ethernet protocol
is called Carrier Sense with  Multiple Access (CSMA).<BR>

<P>
If two stations transmit at the same time, a collision
occurs.  Collisions are normal in the operation of Ethernet. A
station does not know if another station is preparing to transmit.
Ethernet resolves this problem by sensing collisions as they happen.
This collision detection (CD) leads to the full access mechanism
name of CSMA/CD (Common Sense with Multiple Access/ Collision
Detection).<BR>

<P>
The stations involved in the collision stop their
data transmissions.  The first station to detect the collision
sends out a collision detect signal to tell other stations on
the ethernet that a collision happened. Each station then delays
a random interval before attempting another transmission. If another
collision occurs after this delay, the station delays by double
a random interval. This doubling will continue until the collisions
subside. This degradation of the delay is called graceful degradation
because it prevents catastrophic failures in the ethernet LAN
that are common to many other LAN protocols.<BR>

<P>
<h2>Ethernet Cabling</h2>

<P>
Three basic types of ethernet cabling are in use:
Coaxial, Twisted Pair and Fiber.<BR>

<P>
Coaxial cables come in three varieties: thick wire,
thin wire and Broadband.
<P>
Twisted Pair is typically Category 5 unshielded twisted
pair.
<P>
Fiber comes in a variety of configurations.<BR>

<P>

<h2>Thick Wire Ethernet Wiring Rules:</h2>

<P>
Thick wire Ethernet is RG-8 coaxial cable. It is just under a
&#189;&quot; in diameter and is marked at intervals of 2.5 meters
to indicate the transciever attachment points. The cable type
used for Thick Wire Ethernet is RG-8.  The IEEE version of standard
Ethernet is called 10BASE5.  The 10 stands for 10 Mbps operation;
the BASE stands for baseband operation; and the 5 stands for 500
meters per segment.
<P>
 
<P>
Thick wire cable is terminated at both ends by a 50-ohm resister
that absorbs the signal to prevent reflections. One of the ends
and only one end should be grounded. Cables can only be spliced
or connected together using standard N-series connectors and barrel
connectors. The transceivers are attached using a tool that creates
and trims the appropriate hole in the cable. When a transceiver
is moved, the tap remains. Only remove the electronics adapter.
Never remove or try to reuse a tap.<BR>

<P>
 Thick wire segments may be attached to each other using repeaters.
A repeater attatches by an AUI cable and transceiver to each segment.
Any path in a 10BASE5 LAN can cross a maximum of 2 repeaters.
There is a special form of repeater called a Link segment repeater.
This is used to connect to ethernet segments over longer distances
using fiber or microwave. The combined pair of link segment repeater
and fiber link is called an Inter-Repeater Link-segment (IRL).
Up to 4 IRL's may be traversed in an Ethernet LAN. Link segments
cannot exceed 1,000 meters.<BR>

<P>
Transceiver cables with AUI connectors can be a maximum of 50
meters. Each transceiver counts as a station. So, repeaters count
as a station on each segment that they attach to. Each segment
can have a maximum of 100 stations. Some repeaters can be attached
in parallel for redundancy.<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>

<P>
<h2>Thin Wire Ethernet Wiring Design Rules:</h2>

<P>
The coaxial cable used in thinwire Ethernet  is much thinner than
that used for Thick Wire Ethernet.  The IEEE version of Thin Wire
Ethernet is called 10BASE2.  The 10 stands for 10 Mbps , the BASE
stands for baseband operation, and the 2 stands for 200 meters
(actually, 185 meters) per segment.
<P>
The transceiver for a Thin Wire Ethernet is in the  NIC electronics.
 No external transceiver connections are made to the NIC.  A BNC
T-connector is used to connect the NIC with the ethernet cable.
 There are three basic connectors that can be used to connect
a station to thinwire ethernet. <BR>

<P>
The most common is to use a T connector. The opposing legs of
the T are used to &quot;splice&quot; the thinwire together. The
remaining leg is connected to a short section of coax using BNC
connectiors. This section is attached directly to the NIC. The
NIC has internal electronics to terminate the end of the coax
segment. If the T connector forms the end of a thinwire segment
the empty leg must have a terminator on it.<BR>

<P>
A station may be connected directly to a thinwire repeater or
multi-access unit with a single segment of coax. A single terminator
and T connector would be required. This is commonly called &quot;radial&quot;
thinwire topology.<BR>

<P>
DEC Open Wiring standards have a non-invasive tap for thinwire
that allows a station to connect to a thinwire segment using a
make-before-break connector. These are used to provide standard
wall-plate outlets in an office environment.<BR>

<P>
 The repeater rules for Thin Ethernet are the same as for Thick
Ethernet.<BR>

<P>
 The trunk coaxial segment length for Thin Ethernet cannot exceed
185 meters.  The maximum
<P>
 number of stations that can be attached to a Thin Ethernet segment
is 30, and the total number of
<P>
 stations cannot exceed 1,024.  The repeater attachment to a segment
counts as one station.  The
<P>
 minimum distance between any two stations is 0.5 meters.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<h2>10BASE-T (Twisted Pair) Wiring Design Rules</h2)

<P>
  Twisted pair ethernet was originally developed by Intel and
Digital Equipment Corporation in an attempt to utilize the existing
telco wiring common in many buildings. The original specification
grew into 10BASE-T. 10BASE-T is the most popular LAN technology.
It is inexpensive, robust, easy to install and easy to use. The
10 stands for 10 Mbps operation; the BASE stands for baseband
operation; and the T stands for twisted-pair wiring.<BR>

<P>
An Ethernet NIC has a telephone-type RJ-45 port, which is officially
called a Media Dependent Interface (MDI) port.  Most NIC cards
have both a RJ-45 and a thinwire connection. The transceiver functions
are performed in the NIC.
<P>
10BASE-T uses a physical star topology with a concentrator serving
as the central
<P>
 switching element.  Concentrators or hubs can connect from 4
to 24 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables which may lead to stations
or other ethernet equipment. This wiring normally consists of
0.4 to 0.6 mm diameter (26 to 22 AWG) unshielded wire in a multipair
cable.  The performance specifications generally are met by 100
meters of 0.5 mm telephone twisted pair. It is normal practice
to install higher performance CAT-5 cable to be ready to operate
at fast ethernet speeds of 100Mbps.<BR>

<P>
A twisted pair Ethernet cable consistes of two simplex segments.
One for transmission and one for receive.
<P>

<table border=1><caption>The standard wiring is:</caption>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>1 </TD><TD WIDTH=150> transmit data +</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>2 </TD><TD WIDTH=150> transmit data -</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>3 </TD><TD WIDTH=150> receive data +</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>6 </TD><TD WIDTH=150> receive data -</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
The remaining 4 wires should be wired straight through. Although  the Ethernet only uses 4 wires,
the others are used by other protocols, such as Token Ring.
<P>
All cables are wired the same. The appropriate cross-over is done
internally on the NIC card. Standard telephone type &quot;silver
satin&quot; cable cannot be used for Ethernet cables. Data rated
UTP cable should be used in all cases. At ADOT we will use CAT-5
cables. The cables are available in a wide range of pre-manufactured
lengths.<BR>

<P>
A special case exists for attaching two and only two workstations
together. A special cross-over patch cord can be built by swapping
the receive and transmit segments. 
<p>

<table border=1><caption>The cable is wired as follows:</caption>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>1</TD><TD WIDTH=210> transmit data + </TD><TD WIDTH=38>3
</TD><TD WIDTH=150>receive data +</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>2 </TD><TD WIDTH=210> transmit data -</TD><TD WIDTH=38>6
</TD><TD WIDTH=150>receive data -</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>3 </TD><TD WIDTH=210> receive data +</TD><TD WIDTH=38>1

<TR><TD WIDTH=32>6 </TD><TD WIDTH=210> receive data  -</TD><TD WIDTH=38>2
</TD><TD WIDTH=150>transmit data -</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>

<P>
A crossover function is implemented in every twisted-pair link
so that the transmitter at one end will be connected to the receiver
at the other. An MDI port on a device with internal cross-over
is marked with the symbol &quot;X.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The concentrator or &quot;hub&quot; in a 10BASE-T LAN serves the
role of a multi-port repeater.  It performs the following functions:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Data packet retiming
<LI>Link Integrity Test - indicates a port is connected
<LI>Auto-partitioning, which disconnects the port in the event
of 30 consecutive collisions, an excessively long single collision,
or babbling input on a port.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The configuration rules for 10BASE-T concentrators are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Maximum of 4 concentrators in a path between any two stations.
<LI>UTP segments cannot exceed 100 meters.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<h2>Mixed Media Ethernet</h2>

<P>
The various transmission cables can be mixed to build an Ethernet.
The following rules apply:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Repeaters are required for segment interconnection.
<LI>The maximum path between two stations can have five segments
and four repeaters.
<LI>If a network path has five segments. Two or more segments
must be link segments. The total length of the link segments should
not exceed 500 meters each.
<LI>If a network path has four segments, two must be link segments.
The link segments should not exceed 1000 meters each.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<h2>Fast Ethernet (100BASE-T)</h2>

<P>
Fast Ethernet or 100BASE-T is a newer standard that is based on
10BASE-T. The higher speeds are attained by reducing the inter-packet
delays from 9.6 microseconds to 960 nanoseconds. The result is
a 10 fold increase in packet rate. <BR>

<P>
Ethernet packets must be transmitted for sufficient time to enable
a station at the extreme end of the LAN to detect a collision.
In 10BASE-T, this time is 56.7 microseconds. Since 100BASE-T packets
are sent at a higher bit rate, the packet is shorter, and the
inter-packet gap is shorter. The transmission time for the smallest
Ethernet packet reduces to 5.76 microseconds. The packet only
travel 250 meters in this time. That reduces the maximum diameter
of a 100BASE-T network to 250 meters.<BR>

<P>
<h2>Switched Ethernet</h2>

<P>
In normal Ethernet, all devices on a LAN share the same &quot;collision
domain&quot;. All activity on the LAN is seen by all devices on
the LAN. This limits the available bandwidth. An Ethernet Switch
allows a LAN to be broken into many collision domains. The switch
will route an Ethernet packet from the source station on one domain
to the destination on another domain. Stations in any other domains
do not &quot;see&quot; the packet and do not contend for the same
bandwidth. <BR>

<P>
Typical Ethernet Switches have several 100BASE-T ports and several
10BASE-T ports. A server or high performance workstation can be
placed on the 100BASE-T segments and most workstations will be
placed on the 10BASE-T segments. This configuration optimizes
throughput, and vastly increases the aggregate capacity of a LAN.
The segments and stations can be dynamically reconfigured.<BR>

<P><img src="demonpc.gif" allign=left><H2>Ethernet Troubleshooting - Physical Frame Corruption</H2><P>When troubleshooting Ethernet networks, the first thing to look for is physical frame corruption. </P><P>NT Network monitor can be used to collect and display information that is useful for troubleshooting.
</P><center><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif"></center>
<p> Physical frame corruption is caused by four primary faults:

<P>The four causes are:<UL>  <LI><STRONG><A HREF="#electric">Electrical Noise.</A></STRONG> Caused by electormagnetic interference. Such as flourescent lighting, or unshielded computer monitors.
  <LI><STRONG><A HREF="#reflections">Signal Reflections.</A></STRONG> Caused by improper cable installation or cable damage.
  <LI><STRONG><A HREF="#collisions">Collisions.</A></STRONG>  Caused by out of  spec. cabling, configuration or faulty hardware.  <LI><STRONG><A HREF="#hardware">Malfunctioning Hardware.</A></STRONG> Caused faults in network interface cards or network hubs.</UL></P>
<center><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif"></center>
<A NAME="collisions"><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Collisions</H3></A><p>When a collision happens, several bytes of the <A HREF="/technical/ethernet/ether-form.htm">frame preamble</a> will be recorded by the monitor before the frame is terminated by a collision. The data will look like several bytes of AA or 55 in hexadecimal. If there are more than 8 bytes of this repeating byte, the data was corrupted by something other than a collision. This is because the preamble is only 8 bytes long.

<A NAME="reflections"><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Signal Reflections</H3></A><p> Signal reflections happen when the electrical signal is reflected from some point on the cable back towards the source. Reflections are normally seen on damaged or unterminated 10Base5 and 10Base2 cables.<P>Reflections may occur in any cable type that is bent in excess of the specifications or "patched" together with inappropriate connctors.

<P>Signal reflection is indicated by very short frames (typically less than 16-32 bytes), with no preamble in the frame. You would see several frames in a sequence cut short at approximately thesame point in the frame. These short frames are called "runt" frames.
<A NAME="electric"><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Electrical Noise</H3></A><P>Physical frame corruption caused by electrical noise looks  similar to corruption caused by reflections. There will be no preamble in the frame. The frame will be cut off at random lengths..</P><A NAME="hardware"><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Hardware Malfunctions</H3></A><p>Frames corrupted by hardware failures appear as random or constant framing problems.
<p>Typical frame problems include:
<UL>  <LI><STRONG>A stream of ones or zeros.</STRONG>  A transceiver has malfunctioned and is "babbling".  Most transceivers have babble detection circuitry that prevents the adapter from continuous transmission.  <LI><STRONG>Very large frames (greater than 1500 bytes).</STRONG>  This is also a sign of a babbling adapter.</UL></P><HR><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Troubleshooting Flowchart</H3><P><OL>  <LI>Is a preamble of AA or 55 (hexadecimal) at the end of each frame and 8 bytes or less in length? 
      <P>If yes:      <UL>        <LI>Check the configuration of the segment for cable length, number of stations, etc.
        <LI>Divide the segment in half using a bridge and continue dividing the faulty half until the problem is located.
     </UL>     <P>Else continue.<P>  <LI>Are the corrupt frames very short, and mostly  the same length?     <P>If yes:     <UL>       <LI>The problem is likely a reflection. Look for unterminated coax cables or tight bends in any cables.

<LI>A Time Domain Reflectometer test can identify the location of a point of reflection.
    </UL>    <P>Else continue.<P>  <LI>If the frames are cut off at random lengths and no data streaming, babbling, is happening:
<UL>        <LI>The problem is electical noise. Use the divide and test method and look for electrical noise sources. A portable A.M. radio is a good tool for locating electical noise sources. Dimmers and faulty flourescent lighting is a common source of electrical moise.
</UL>      <P>Else continue>   <LI>At this point you will need to use a bridge or switch to divide the segment or a Fluke tester to identify the MAC or location of the fault.

<H2>IEEE 802.3 Frame Format</H2>
<P>The IEEE 802.3 specification further defines the Ethernet frame format.  The two frame formats can
co-exist on the same cable.  However, a workstation that uses IEEE 802.3 frame format cannot process
an Ethernet V2 frame using the same network protocol.  The main difference between the two is the
Length/Type field.

<H2>The Data Link Header</H2>

<P>
<DL>
  <A NAME="destination">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 0-5: Destination Address</STRONG>
  <DD><P>The first six bytes of an Ethernet frame make up the destination address.This is the MAC address of the station that the frame is being sent to. Some special destination addresses are defined. A destination address of all ones indicates a Broadcast Message that is sent to all Ethernet adapters.

      <P>The first three bytes of the Destination Address indicate the vendor of the NIC, unique blocks of addresses are assigned to each vendor.

  <A NAME="source">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 6-11: Source Address</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>The next six bytes of an Ethernet frame are the Source Address. The Source Address indicates which adapter the message was sent from. Again, the first three bytes indicate the NIC vendor.

  <A NAME="length">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 12-13: Length</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>Bytes 13 and 14 of an Ethernet frame indicate the length of the data in the frame, excluding: the
<A href="/technical/ethernet/frame-form#preamble">preamble</A>, 32 bit CRC, DLC addresses, and the Length field itself.  An Ethernet frame can be no shorter than 64 bytes total length, and no longer than 1518 bytes total length.<P>
</DL>
</P>
<center><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif"></center>
<A NAME="802.2LLC"><H2>802.2 LLC Header (Optional)</H2></A>

<P>Following the Data Link Header is the Logical Link Control Header. The LLC header points to a memory buffer on the adapter. The data is placed in theis buffer. The LLC is used by drivers and other layers of the network to reteive data from the NIC.

<P>
<DL>
  <A NAME="DSAP">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 15: DSAP</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>The DSAP, or Destination Service Access Point, is a 1 byte field that points to a memory buffer in the receiving
station. Multi-protocol stacks use this pointer to indicate where the data is to be stored in the stations memory.

  <A NAME="SSAP">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 16: SSAP</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>The SSAP, or Source Service Access Point is similar to the DSAP. It specifies the source budffer for data transmits.
<p> 
  <A NAME="LLC_control">
  <DT><STRONG>Offset 17: Control Byte</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>Following the SSAPs is a one byte field that indicates the type of LLC frame.<P>

<center><IMG SRC="colorbar.gif"></center>
<H2>User Data and FCS</H2>

<P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Data: 43-1497 Bytes</STRONG>
  <DD><P>Following the 802.2 header is a data packet that varies from  43 to 1,497 bytes.
<P>
  <A NAME="FCS">
  <DT><STRONG>FCS last 4 bytes</STRONG></A>
  <DD><P>The frame is checked for data integrity by comparing a calculated checksum at the receiving station to the FCS that was calculated by the sending station. If they don't agree, the packet is discarded.

State employees get 100 percent bus subsidies</h2></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=4  color=#8b2252>Phoenix-</font></strong>State employees will be offered 100 percent bus subsidies through next March to help reduce carbon monoxide pollution in the Valley, according to a plan announced by Gov. Fife Symington on October 1.<p>
"We had phenominal success with bus subsidies during our ozone campaign and will continue to make a significant contribution by staying the course during the carbon monoxide season," said Symington, who first offered state employees the bus subsidies last May in an effort to reduce ozone problems.  "We hope citizens and businesses will join us in round two of this important fight."
<p>
By funding the incentive throught the winter months, Symington said the state will be able to tie in with next year's subsidy for the 1997 ozone season, and thus provide continuous support for state employees willing to leave their cars at home throught the end of next September.<p>
Symington said approximately 2,500 state employees rode the bus as part of Operation Ozone during the months of June, July and August, avoiding emissions of 4.4 tons of ozone-forming chemicals.<p>

Delay in Congress doesn&#146;t stop metric
</H2></a>
<P><font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</strong></font>Although Congress has delayed implementation of the metric system in state 
departments of transportation to the year 2000, ADOT is moving forward in designing and 
constructing highway projects in metric units.
<P>Thomas Buhr, ADOT's metric coordinator, said Congress is allowing states with 
metric programs to implement them while giving other state DOT's additional time to catch up.
<P>About 90 percent of the state DOT's are ready to use the metric system, he said.
ADOT employees will see a faster transition to metric, not only in the 
Intermodal Transportation Division, but also in the 
Administrative Services and Motor Vehicle Divisions.
<P>The department is working with the Associated General Contractors, Arizona 
Rock Products Association and Arizona Subcontractors Association to develop a training 
program this fall for field construction personnel.  
The training will be open to ADOT employees.
<P>Another key area in which ADOT is preparing for the metric system is in computer 
systems.  A major meeting was held in July to address all systems and to plan the conversions 
to metric.  The FAST system already accepts metric units, but other systems, likes TRACS 
and PECOS, have not yet been converted.
<P>MVD also is beginning to look at converting to metric, including the weighing of 
trucks through ports-of-entry.
<P> All documents for designing and constructing highways already have been converted 
to metric.  Early implementation in this area allowed ADOT to award its first metric project at 
the beginning of this year.  The project is a rock containment job on SR 89A in Oak Creek Canyon.

<a name="lanes"><h2>
HOV lanes opened to all during off peak hours
</h2></a>
<strong><font size=4 color=#8b2252>Phoenix-</strong></font> Ever get on the freeway late at night after a special event at one of the arenas or sports complexes in the Valley late at night and know you could get home faster if you could just drive in that extra diamond-marked lane?<p>
Your wish has been granted: now during non-rush hours all vehicles can use the carpool lanes on the Valley freeway system.  The signs with the new access hours were put along 70 miles of carpool lanes on I-10, I-17 and Loop 202 in September.<p>
The change was made in an effort to maximize the usage of the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes by allowing all traffic to use the lanes during off-peak times, while still encouraginging carpooling during the heavy volume rush hours.  The lanes will still be reserved for buses, motorcycles and vehicles with more than one passenger from 6 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday.<p>
The only area where the restrictions have not changed is the carpool lane on southbound I-17 between Beardsley Road and Peoria Avenue.  This section is still being evaluated based on safety concerns for traffic merging at the end of the carpool lane.<p>

State has two new scenic highways

<!--<img src="us-66.jpg" width=300 border=1 align=right  text=left  vspace=10  hspace=10>-->
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Glendale-</strong></font> Arizona has two new officially-designated scenic highways to 
attract tourists to the visual wonders of Monument Valley, the Grand Canyon and the 
forest-covered Kaibab Plateau.
<P>The new scenic highways are the 23-mile Kayenta-Monument Valley Scenic Road 
(U.S. 163) in the northeast corner of Arizona and the 85-mile Fredonia Vermilion Cliffs 
Scenic Road (SR 89A) on the Arizona Strip above 
the Grand Canyon.
 State Transportation Board members on June 21 designated the two scenic routes.  
The highways will be placed on various tourist maps; be eligible for special funding for 
tourist facilities; have special scenic road signs, 
and receive special treatment from ADOT so that signs, guardrails and bridges blend in with 
the surrounding area.

<a name="program"><h2>
Competitive government program comes to ADOT</h2></a>
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</font></strong> In today's work environment, companies of all sizes and in all industries are taking a hard look at the bottom line.  They are all asking themselves and their employees, "What can we do to become more competitive in the marketplace?" These days government is no different.<p>
ADOT is one of 36 state agencies currently evaluating products and services they are responsible for.  The goal is to ensure that state government is providing services at a level of quality and cost effectiveness that is competitive with private companies.<p>
The Competitive Government Program is the result of a bill signed into law by Governor Symington last May 1. The program outlines a way of identifying and evaluating government services to determine if the services are better provided from within ADOT or by an outside vendor.<p>
ADOT was a pilot agency in the development of this program.  The department's Competitive Government Committee is made up of 19 members representing a cross section of the department's divisions and organizations to review potential projects, ensuring an unbiased approach.<p>
"It is important for ADOT employees to realize that this program is not about privatization," explains Randy Berry, the program manager and a member of ADOT's Competitive Government Committee.  "Through this evaluation process, we are also discovering areas where outsourcing ADOT services may be more costly than creating new jobs within ADOT."<p>
According to Berry, the statewide program outlines specific steps the committee must follow to identify and evaluate government services.  If a service or function is identified as an area where the private sector could potentially do the job, it does not necessarily mean that service will be "privatized." State employees have the right to compete for the opportunity to provide that service and to prepare budgets and cost plans for that service.<p>
Before a service can be privatized, it must go through a two tier process.  The principal requirement is that the decision is based not only on cost, but the organization must provide a minimum of the same level or better service.<p>
In a recent letter to all ADOT employees, Director Larry Bonine stressed that the program's intent is not to "privatize" the department, but rather to encourage everyone to be more competitive in today's business environment.<p>

All are slated for restoration thanks to a $500,000 increase in funding from the State Transportation Board, bringing the total for these and three other projects to $2 million.<P>
Besides the projects in Willcox, Yuma and Winkleman, funding has been increased for the Arizona Railway Museum in Chandler, the Old Safford Road Bridge in Greenlee County and the Gates Pass Road Scenic Outlook in Pima County.  Work on the projects is scheduled to begin by early 1997 and be completed some time during the year.<p>

I-10 fronatage road project gets underway
</h2></a>
<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Tucson</strong></font> A $4.2 million project to reconstruct two miles of the westbound frontage road on I-10 between Ruthrauff and Prince Roads on Tucson's north side was started in early September by Hunter Contracting Company of Gilbert.  The job will be completed in about a year.<p>
The project is the second in a series of frontage road projects that eventually will provide two-lane, continuous one-way frontage roads on both sides of 1-10 from Ruthrauff Road to the I-10/I-19 interchange, a distance of about eight miles.<p>
In addition to roadway reconstruction, the project includes rebuilding the westbound on-ramp at Prince Road and the westbound off-ramp at Ruthrauff Road; relocating utilities, and improving drainage structures for the future widening of the I-10 mainline.

<a name="contract"><h2>
Contract awarded for Squaw Peak freeway

<font size=4  color=#8b2252><strong>Phoenix-</strong></font> The State Transportation Board has awarded a $36.2 million contract to build the next 2.2 miles of the Squaw Peak Freeway (SR 51) north from Shea Boulevard to Thunderbird Road in northeast Phoenix.  The contract was awarded to Meadow Valley Contracting, Inc., of Phoenix.<p>
The project will include construction of the north half of the interchange at Shea Boulevard, a full interchange at Cactus Road and a half-diamond interchange at Thunderbird Road.  The freeway will be recessed at Shea Boulevard and Cactus Road, and will be elevated at Indian Bend Wash and Thunderbird Road.<p>
Work will be completed by late 1998.  Later this year, the Transportation Board plans to award the contract for the Squaw Peak Freeway between Thunderbird and Bell Roads.  This section also will be finished by late 1998.

Two-way traffic permitted on U.S. 93;
paving work continues

<TABLE border=0 width=100%>

<TD>
&#40 October 24, 1996&#41; - Paving operations have been changed on U.S. 93 south of Hoover Dam to permit two-way traffic through the work zone, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).<p>

	George Cisney, an ADOT project supervisor based in Kingman, said the two-way traffic comes with a caveat: an enforced 25 mph speed limit through the three-mile-long paving work zone.<p>

	Cisney said the 25 mph speed limit also will be enforced through a one-mile-long work zone where new guardrail is being constructed.<p>

	This still leaves about 11 miles at 45 mph in the 15-mile project area, he said.<p>

	ADOT had been encouraging motorists to use an alternate route through an earlier pavement removal and replacement phase.  This work is completed and the contractor now has more space to put down an additional two-and-a-half inches of asphalt over the highway, leaving two 11-foot travel lanes.<p>

	Work hours for the project are 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday.  Paving will be completed in mid-November and guardrail construction will be finished in mid-December.  Work started in August.<p>

	Cisney said the paving work is needed because this section of U.S. 93 is rough and cracking and has not been resurfaced in about 30 years.  About 9,000 vehicles travel on U.S. 93 in the Hoover Dam area each day.<p>

	FNF Construction, Inc., of Tempe is the general contractor for the $3.5 million project.<p>

<p>Adopt-a-Highway is a program where groups volunteer to pick up litter off of Arizona&#146;s freeways and highways.<p>
As of 1996, the volunteers have saved Arizona taxpayers more than $250,000 annually in litter pickup costs.  ADOT spends on average $1 million annually to pick up litter along the more than 6000 miles of state highway.<p>
The program started in 1988 with approximately 120 groups.  By 1991, all available mileage was adopted in the metropolitan areas.  By fall of 1995, more than 1300 groups had adopted over 2300 miles of Arizona&#146;s highways.<p>
Groups include civic and community groups, business organizations and even families.

<P>Dear Mr. Pearce:
<P>     	This letter is to express our gratitude for all the assistance the personnel in your department have provided to the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center's driver rehabilitation program.  For the last 10 years, we have received excellent cooperation and assistance from the Motor Vehicle Division.  The efforts of your staff have aided a countless number of veterans and we want to thank you for a job well done!<p>
	We recently highlighted these contributions in our employee newsletter, the Desert Sun.  Again, thanks for all your assistance in helping put our veterans first.<p>

<P>Dear Sir:
<P>     
	Just a short note to let you know that one of your employees saved the day for us three older ladies when he helped change a front tire on our van after we had a blow out on SR 69 in early September.  We were coming back from camping in Prescott when the tire blew.<p>
	Jim Medlin was coming along with his big yellow piece of equipment when we flagged him down.  Jim saved the day helping three damsels in distress.  We now have learned where to place the jack under the van.<p>

<P>Dear Sir:
<P>     	Working for ADOT for the summer of 1996 was an interesting experience.  It was nothing like the other summer programs I have participated in.  I was able to learn and grow in vast directions that varied from running equipment to being a flagger.<p>
	There were classes which were available that benefit me in many ways.  A CPR and First Aid class allowed me to get an official card and certificate.  The two-way radio class opened my eyes to the eyes and voice of the "10-4" lingo.  The flagger school officially certified me to flag and control traffic.<p>
	I enjoyed working with everyone and had no problems.  The crew made it easier for me to "fit in" among the male workers.<p>

Wikieup Maintenance</strong>
</ul>
<P>Dear Mr. Masten:
<P>     	About 10 miles out of Wikieup on the Wickenburg side (U.S. 93), some of the tread on the right rear tire of my car came off on July 1. Due to the fact that I don't function well in the middle of the day heat and because my wife didn't want me to try to change the tire, we had just put a call into AAA.<p>
	Just as my call was being completed, Mr. Jim Fountain came by and stopped.  He changed the tire and put the "doughnut" tire on.  When Mr. Fountain finished with the tire, I attempted to give him some money.  He let me understand very adamantly that he would not take any gratuities.  However, I am sure that this letter will be acceptable in lieu of anything else.<p>

<P>Dear Sir:
<P>     	On our way to Prescott on June 14, we broke down on SR 69 about 25 miles out of Prescott.  Within five minutes, one of your big trucks stopped to see if we needed help or water.  We said we were going to be OK.<p>
	Within another two minutes, a pick-up driven by Elias Bais stopped.  When he saw that we would not be able to fix our truck, he let us use his truck phone to call AAA.  He came by a couple more times to check on us and make sure that we had water.  We want to let you know that we really appreciate that you have people like Elias Bais working for you.<p>

<P>Gentlemen:
<P>     	On August 8, my wife and I stopped at the Salt River Canyon Rest Area on U.S. 60 and inadvertently locked our car keys in the car.  After attempting to get in, we gave up.  We saw Patrick Macumber and his co-worker (Hank Kitchens) working at the rest area.<p>
	Even though it was raining hard, Patrick made three trips to the top of the hill to make calls on his CB because his set would not work in the valley.  He contacted our AAA representative and got a wrecker to come to our assistance.<p>
</td>

<tr>
<td colspan=2> Although they had to leave the area before the wrecker arrived, they made sure that other ADOT workers were aware of our situation and kept tabs on us for our safety.<p>
	These men are a credit to your organization.  I commend them for their concern over their fellow man and their initiative to do something about it.<p></td>

<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>W</font></strong>hen a bridge designer wants to know how long or high a bridge should be over a river or wash, the first stop is the Bridge Drainage Section.<p>
"Basically, what we do is correlate the amount of rain that will be transformed into runoff in a channel at a highway crossing," said George Lopez-Cepero, manager of the eight-person section that also includes four engineers and three drainage designers.  "This is known as hydrology.<p>
"Once we know how much water in cubic meters per second will be traveling under a bridge, we do a hydraulic analysis to determine the depth, width and velocity of the flow," added Lopez-Cepero who has been the Bridge Drainage manager for 12 years.  "That serves as the basis to know how high and how long a bridge needs to be."<p>
To do their studies, the designers (all of whom are graduate engineers) and the engineers "read" topographic maps to delineate the drainage basin for a river or wash and to gather information on elevations, slopes and distances.<p>
The data is fed into state-of-the-art computer programs to calculate the information bridge designers need to know.<p>
"We make sure we use the latest technology available," said Lopez-Cepero, who joined ADOT in 1978.  "Today we have computer programs that can quickly forecast with accuracy and with a high degree of confidence.<p>
"This means we can spend our time looking into more details about all the factors that affect hydrology and hydraulics," he added.<p>
However, the Bridge Drainage Section is not satisfied with its technology.  The section is looking into linking digitized mapping with a computer program that will automatically provide information on water flowing toward a bridge site.<p>
The digitized mapping will provide a 3-D look at a drainage basin and the computer program will gather the information that is now done by "reading" topographic maps.
Lopez-Cepero said the new technology would permit the Bridge Drainage Section to complete its work faster.<p>

<p>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>ADOT</strong></font> is exploring new ways to fill up its civil engineering positions in rural districts with a diversed work force.  A new program encourages females and minority high school students to consider civil engineering careers, particularly at ADOT.
<p>
It provides materials called Transportation and Research Activities Center (TRAC) that include a sound level meter, ultrasonic motion detector, multipurpose lab interface and a computer that graphs the results of the variations in force or speed.<p>
The TRACPAC Education Program, jointly sponsored by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway  Administration, is a hands-on experience to conduct real engineering investigations in math and science classes.  TRAC also provides toll-free numbers to teachers for additional technical assistance with the program.<p>
Karen Halloway, Engineer-In-Training program manager, said AASHTO hopes to reach as many high schools as possible.  She said some communities in the Globe district showed great interest in the project even before receiving complete information.<p>
Holloway is looking for ADOT engineers in the rural areas to mentor the TRAC Program, especially next year when additional schools will be reached.  She also added, Northern Arizona University will help implement TRAC in Arizona.

allowing motorists to drive 75 mph between Ash Fork and the New Mexico state line, 
according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.
<P>The speed limit increase was made on July 31st.  To make it official, ADOT sign 
crews had to replace or update 148 signs along the route.
<P>The change means drivers now are allowed to legally drive 75 mph almost the 
entire 359 mile route.  The speed limit was raised from 65 mph to 75 mph on 145 miles of 
1-40 from Ash Fork to the California state line

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<P>This latest increase in the speed limit from 65 mph to 75 mph was approved 
after ADOT traffic engineers, in consultation with the Arizona Department of Public Safety, 
completed a study of the highway section.
<P>However, it was determined that heavy commuter and interchange traffic will 
require the 65 mph speed limit to remain in effect 
on about six miles of 1-40 through Flagstaff.
<P>Curve warning signs have been posted at two locations:
<ul>
<li>About one mile of 1-40 east of Joseph City from milepost 278 and milepost 279.
<li>About one mile of 1-40 east of Houck near the New Mexico state line from milepost 
349 and milepost 350.
</ul>
<P>The change brings to 837 the total number of interstate miles in Arizona 
increased from 65 mph to 75 mph.  The state has 
about 1,100 miles of interstate highways.

Motor Vehicle Division cracking down on phony or 
unacceptable documents for driver licenses
</h1></a>
<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><Strong>A</Strong></font> tightened policy against the use of fraudulent documents to get Arizona driver or 
identification licenses has been implemented, the state Motor Vehicle Division has announced.
<P>Under a new state law, MVD is updating its policy on documents that will be 
accepted from someone applying for a license or ID card.  All applicants will need to provide 
verifiable documents which establish that he or she is legally entitled to obtain an Arizona license.
<P>MVD has developed a list of documents that can be used to obtain a driver license, 
instruction permit or ID card.  From that list, applicants can present two forms of approved 
identification, if one of them includes his or her photo, OR three forms of approved identification 
without a photo.
<P>While there is no estimate of how many people get licenses through the use of 
fraudulent documents, or how many licenses are obtained by people who are not legally entitled to them, 
it is known that the use of such licenses and documents is a serious problem in Arizona.
<P>In the hands of a dishonest person, an ill-gotten driver license can make it easier for 
the bearer to pass bad checks, rip off businesses, get undeserved government services and 
sometimes even assume an innocent person's identity.<p>

<strong> You must present two forms of identification, one of which has your photo, or provide three forms of approved identification which don't include a photo.  One of the documents submitted must be listed in column A listed below.  Other forms of ID submitted must be listed in either column A or B.<p></strong>

<td align=left valign=top  width=250>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>I</strong></font>t's been a busy year for Motor Vehicle Division inspectors who have the job of looking out for stolen cars among the thousands of vehicles that are brought into MVD inspection centers.  Through the end of September, more than 275 cars and trucks that were either stolen or had stolen parts on them had been snared by division inspectors around the state.<p>
In Tucson, inspector George Collaco said teamwork is paying off for the squad of inspectors at MVD's Regional Service Center.  Collaco had just recorded the 50th stolen car intercepted this year at the Tucson facility.<p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
"We're getting a lot of support," Collaco said .  "The management staff here answered the call when we said we needed the right tools and equipment in order to do a better job with inspections.  Equipment like better jacks to lift up cars has made our work easier, faster and safer to do."<p>
Collaco said he discovered 33 of the stolen cars at the Tucson center.  Scott Tankersley, now working at MVD's enforcement office in Globe, recovered 11 of the vehicles while Dan Valencia, who joined the Tucson staff in June, had nabbed six stolen cars, Collaco said.<p>
All the stolen cars recovered at the Tucson center were spotted as a result of "level two" inspections, which are required when vehicles listed as being salvaged or restored are going through the registration process.<p>
Mike Veucasovic, enforcement manager at MVD's Office of Special Investigations in Phoenix, said 90 percent of the 275 cars and trucks recovered as a result of MVD inspections were full vehicles, while the remaining 10 percent were cars with stolen parts, including engines.<p>
"Our inspectors have the job of making sure identification numbers on the cars match," he said.<p>
Collaco said his office prides itself on making sure that no level two inspection is completed until those vehicle identification numbers are located. <p> 
"We get a lot of assistance from our level one inspectors and that gives us the time to do thorough inspections without increasing our customer wait times," he said.<p>
Collaco, who spends a lot of time on his back looking for signs that a vehicle is stolen, said the level one inspectors do a good job sending cars to the level two stage when their initial check "just doesn't feel right."<p>
Once a car is identified as or suspected of being stolen, Veucasovic said MVD contacts local police or, in some cases, the Department of Public Safety.  Collaco said the Tucson police auto theft unit has spent countless hours assisting the MVD team with difficult inspections.

MVD taking steps to cut wait times</h1></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>T</strong></font>he woman had just arrived at the Motor Vehicle Division office in Kingman when she exclaimed, "Wow, this is great!" Not a comment usually associated with a trip to a driver license office, but in this case the woman was very happy MVD had set up a "greeter's station" where a staff member makes sure customers have all the right documents before they proceed with their license or vehicle title and registration business.<p>
That's one of a number of moves MVD is making to reduce both customer frustration and the amount of time spent waiting for service.  The division's equation looks like this: E + C = LW (hard working EMPLOYEES plus help from COMPUTERS equals LESS WAITING).  And the results have been impressive.<p>
From Bullhead City to Nogales, MVD reports show the average wait before a customer gets to a service counter is often well under 20 minutes.  MVD Director Russell Pearce has set a goal of getting that average wait time to less than 10 minutes.<p>
At the Kingman office, Customer Service Representative Faye Rainey said the hiring of two more employees this year has helped shrink the amount of time customers spend waiting for help.  MVD held a job fair in August to hire 125 workers in many offices across the state.<p>
As for computers, one of the major improvements at several MVD offices, including Kingman, is the Q-Matic customer traffic system.  This computerized system gives customers numbered tickets corresponding to the type of driver or auto license business they wish to transact.  The system works to determine which customer should go to which counter, with an emphasis on cutting time spent waiting.  An easy-to-read display board, with bright red lights, then shows the numbers of customers being served at the counters in the office.<p>
"The customers seem to really like it," Rainey said.  "In the past here in Kingman, people would sometimes wait as long as two hours just to find out they didn't have all the proper documents to get a license or get their car registered.  Now with the greeter helping to make sure the paperwork is right, plus the extra staffing and Q-Matic, people aren't wasting time."<p>
Diane Minton, MVD's assistant director for field/customer services, said the Q-Matic system updates and stores data on the amount of time spent waiting, as well as the types of services in demand <p>
 "It gives supervisors a chance to monitor and adjust to the flow of customers and their service needs." she said .  "The great thing is they can actually see if the changes they make are working."<p>
The Q-Matic system is being installed in more offices in the Phoenix and Tucson areas as well as greater Arizona.  Pearce wants almost all of the state's MVD service centers to have the system so that more and more customers can get out of line, in a manner of speaking.<p>

Organ donation change on driver licenses<br>
could help increase donors in Arizona
</H1></a>
<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>A</strong></font> change has been made to the Arizona driver license which could increase the number 
of organ donors in the state.  The change to the organ donation section of the license has 
been announced by the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division and Donor Network of Arizona (DNA).
<P>Under a new state law, Arizona driver licenses and state identification cards no 
longer include the section showing the words &quot;organ donor&quot; followed by a &quot;yes or no&quot; answer to 
the question of whether the person getting the license wishes to be an organ donor.
<P>Instead, people interested in becoming organ donors are asked to fill out organ donor 
cards provided by the Arizona Save-a-Life Alliance and then affix a sticker containing the word 
&quot;donor&quot; to the back of their licenses.
<P>This change is part of the 1996 Revised Arizona Anatomical Gift Act passed 
overwhelmingly by lawmakers and signed by Governor Fife Symington.  It is intended to give people 
more flexibility in changing their decision about being an organ donor.
<P>
<P>With Arizona providing an extended driver license that's valid for several years, 
people obtaining licenses now don't face the requirement of renewing their licenses in order to 
change their donor status from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes.&quot; A license holder is able to place one of the new 
&quot;donor&quot; stickers on the back of a license to notify others that he or she has filled out a donor card 
and wishes to be an organ donor.
<P>In addition to MVD offices, the Arizona Save-a-Life Alliance and Donor Network of 
Arizona is making the &quot;donor&quot; stickers available at other locations, including doctors offices.
<P>The change does not impact current licenses showing a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer to the 
organ donor question.

Motor Vehicle Division gets two-year registration program underway
</H1></a>
<P><font size=+3 color=#8b2252><strong>S</strong></font>ome owners of cars and trucks in Arizona will get a chance to register their vehicles 
once every two years under a new program, according to state Motor Vehicle Division Director 
Russell Pearce.
<P>MVD is notifying owners of vehicles qualifying for the two year registration program 
that they will save money by paying one $8 registration fee to cover the two-year registration 
period, instead of $16 for two separate annual registrations.
<P>Vehicles automatically selected for two-year registration are those with an annual 
vehicle license tax of $50 or less.  The vehicles also must either be exempt from emissions testing OR 
be scheduled to undergo an IM 240 emissions test for the first year of the two-year 
registration period.
<P>Owners of qualified vehicles not automatically selected for the two-year registration 
program because their annual vehicle license tax exceeds $50 will be able to participate on a 
voluntary basis.  Their vehicles would also need to be exempt from emissions testing OR be in the 
first year of the two-year IM 240 emissions testing cycle.
<P>The two-year registration program will benefit MVD customers in a number of ways.  
In addition to saving $8 dollars and postage in second year registration fees, customers won't 
have to deal with registering their vehicles every year.  MVD is working to keep customers 
from standing in line at driver and auto license offices.  Two-year registration will also allow MVD 
to reduce labor and postage costs involved in processing one-year registrations.

Out-of-state plate campaign <br>increases revenue for MVD
</H1></a>
<P><font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>B</strong></font>eefed up efforts to locate cars and trucks that should be registered in Arizona have 
paid off for the state, according to figures compiled by the Motor Vehicle Division.
<P>Last year MVD launched an aggressive campaign to register out of state vehicles driven 
by legal residents of Arizona.  Records show the number of out of state vehicles now being 
registered surged during the first half of this year.
<P>In the last six months of 1995, MVD recorded 80,600 out of state vehicle 
registrations and collected $11.8 million in vehicle license taxes for those cars and trucks.
<P>In the first six months of this year, the number of out of state registrations increased 
to 109,610.  Vehicle license taxes collected on those registrations totaled $16.4 million.

University mascots produce cheers<br> for issuing 1.5 million driver licenses
</h1></a>
<p>The mascots from the U of A, ASU and NAU helped MVD officials marked   the one year anniversary of the new digital driver license by getting their "sample" licenses prior to the start of this year's football season.  So far, more than 1.5 million of the state's improved licenses have been obtained by Arizona drivers.  MVD projects that more than 70 percent of the state's drivers will have a new license by the end of next year.<p>

<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>W</strong></font>alter Pellett, who helped design more than half of the 1,169-mile interstate highway system in Arizona, still has fond memories of the historic era that started 40 years ago when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the interstate highway bill into law.<p>
"I particularly enjoyed the public hearings and the field inspections," said Pellett, who designed interstate highways first as a design squad leader then as assistant state engineer for design for 13 years.<p>
The interstate highway system, while the largest public works program in the world and an economic boon to the nation, faced controversy in rural communities because businessmen felt the proposed bypasses would cut off their economic lifeline.<p>
This led to some hotly debated location and design public hearings.<p>
"They felt we should go right through these little towns so we would go by all the motels," said Pellett, who retired in 1983 as assistant state engineer for local government projects.  "However, if we cut a 300-foot swath through the small towns we would have wiped out a lot of businesses and residents.  It also would have been cost prohibitive."<p>
Ultimately, the bypasses, which were built about a half-mile from the rural communities so motorists could still see the towns, were constructed last to soften the impact of the interstate highways, Pellett said.<p>
Another aspect of interstate design which Pellett enjoyed was establishing new alignments to replace circuitous state highways with straighter interstate highways.<p>
"When the design got to a certain point-about two-thirds done-we'd go out and inspect for proper grades, drainage and other particulars to make sure no problems were created in the design" said Pellett, now 78 and living in north Phoenix.<p>
"You went to a point and started hiking," he said.  "I'm sure I hiked at least 600 miles of the interstate system along with several other people."<p>
The district engineer and representatives from construction and right-of-way also were on the field inspections teams, Pellett said.<p>
A lot of hiking also was done by survey crews that set the initial alignments before design work started, Pellett said.<p>
"Those guys would be out for weeks at a time in the field camping out," he said.<p>
Field crews initially used topographic maps to set alignments, but later switched to the new technology of aerial photography.<p>
With much of his 32-year career dedicated to the interstate highway system, Pellett goes down as one of the forefathers of the system in Arizona.

Outpouring of concern and support<br> follow John Tucker&146;s untimely death
</H1></a>
<p>
<strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>T</strong></font>he death of John Tucker while working for ADOT on the I-10 Maricopa Freeway produced the largest outpouring of concern and support for a fallen employee in more than 30 years.<p>
ADOT employees from throughout the state and from all parts of the Intermodal Transportation Division traveled to Phoenix to attend two memorial services for Tucker a few days after he was killed while painting a traffic signal at the 40th Street overpass.<p>
One service was held at a church in north Phoenix and was followed by a 200 truck procession down the Black Canyon Freeway to the State Capitol where officials from ADOT and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) presented plaques to the Tucker family.<p>
Eddie Newkirk, supervisor for the Mesa Maintenance ORG, requested the procession to call attention to the dangerous conditions under which ADOT personnel work.  He also helped organize the procession.<p>
Tucker, a steward for the ADOT Chapter of AFSCME, had touched a number of employees in his 10 years with the department.<p>
"He had a heck of a personality," said Bob Etheredge, Tucker's supervisor in Phoenix Signals and Lighting.  "He was very outgoing and outspoken.  He was always laughing."<p>
Etheredge also said Tucker was "a very cautious type person."<p>
"He had all the gear on at the time of the accident including the respirator, safety shoes, safety glasses, gloves and harness," he said.<p>
Tucker inadvertently moved the boom of his cherry picker over a lane adjacent to his truck.  He was struck by a tractor trailer and suffered massive injuries.  The truck driver was not cited.<p>
Tucker, 48, is survived by his fiancee, Cheryl Kelley, a daughter, a son, his father and two brothers.  Tucker was a native Arizonan and a Navy veteran.<p>

<a name="zone"><h1>
ADOT increasing measures <br>to ensure work zone safety
</h1></a>
<p>
<font size=+3  color=#8b2252><strong>W</strong></font>ork zone safety was brought close to home when John Tucker, a traffic signal and lighting crew supervisor, was killed on August 20 when a tractor-trailer crashed into his cherry-picker basket while he was painting a traffic signal at the 40th Street overpass on I-10.<p>
However, the issue of work zone safety has been a priority for ADOT since early this year when the Executive Quality Council identified the issue as the top concern in the department and began taking steps to increase safety for the agency's field workers.<p>
Safety measures being taken by the department include increasing safety responsibilities among managers; modifying the way accident statistics are reported within the agency; developing legislation to increase fines for motorists who do not drive safely in work zones; working closer with law enforcement agencies on ticketing and other safety measures, and producing a television public service announcement for stations statewide. <p>
"There will be increased emphasis on talking about safety and safety awareness at the working level," said Mary Peters, ADOT's deputy director.  "We're holding every manager in this organization responsible for safety, beginning in this office.  Safety is everybody's responsibility, but managers have to take the lead in creating safety awareness."<p>
This, however, will not relieve ADOT workers for increasing their own safety awareness, said State Engineer Tom Schmitt.<p>
"With the best traffic control, there are still risks," Schmitt said.  "We have to take every precaution we can because life is too precious.  The key is awareness.  You have to be constantly aware.  We have to remember to move up the attenuator truck as the operation moves.  Everybody has to look out for everybody else. It just has to be the way we do our jobs."<p>
Peters added that ORG's will be encouraged to predict what accidents can occur in their work zones and to plan accordingly.  A pilot project along these lines in the Executive Quality Council showed promise, she said.<p>
"Accidents are predictable and preventable," Peters said.<p>
Closely related to increased awareness is a change in the way accident information will be reported at all levels within the department.<p>
Joe Puente, manager of the Safety Office, said his staff is working on a reporting system that will compare accidents among ADOT employees to national statistics for different occupations.  The reports will be sent down to the ORG'S.  These statistics have gone to the engineering districts and MVD regions in the past.<p>
The statistics also will be put in a new format so they are easier to read and understand, Puente said.<p>
Additionally, ADOT will begin using the Access program for reporting accidents within the department.  This means ORG's will be able to input information on accidents and get more timely reports for their safety meetings.<p>
"That's going to help us know if we have safety is Schmitt said.<p>
Another measure that will be taken to increase work zone safety is to introduce legislation in the next session of the Arizona Legislature to double fines for motorists convicted of speeding or other violations in work zones, Peters said.<p>
"Double fines would be a tool law enforcement could use to make the public conscious that traffic violations in work zones are not acceptable," she said.<p>
The measure will be supported by the Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement agencies, she noted.<p>
Law enforcement also wants to work closer with ADOT in cross training personnel and in positioning electronic signs in work zones to let motorists know how fast they are traveling, Peters said.<p>
However, the bottom line is individual commitment to work zone safety, Schmitt said.<p>
"No matter what the resources or the nature of the work, there's nothing out there that should preclude our employees from doing their work safely," he said.<p>

The driver whips around the corner and the car suddenly comes to a screeching halt as he notices the situation ahead.  A flagman warns the driver to slow down through the work zone for his safety and the safety of the crew working on the road.<p>
This is just one of the scenes in two TV public service announcements created by ADOT and the Governor's Office of Community and Highway Safety.  The PSA's will air on television stations statewide.<p>
The purpose of the commercials is to remind drivers to be more aware of workers on the road and respect traffic control that is set up on the roadway.  Drivers speeding through work zones and damage or theft of traffic control items are frequent problems that many ADOT workers are faced with on a regular basis.<p>
One commercial features legendary Indy driver Tom Sneva speeding around Phoenix International Raceway as he discusses the fact that he doesn't slow down for too many things.  Then, he approaches a work zone and the car slows to a crawl as he passes the ADOT workers.<p>
The second spot shows a group of teenagers stealing and destroying cones on the highway.  The teenagers celebrate their conquest until they realize that the cones have come to life to seek revenge.  One boy wakes up from the nightmare only to find his bed surrounded by cones.<p>

<P><strong><font size=+3  color=#8b2252>N</strong></font>ow that camping restrictions have been lifted, motorists can travel faster to the 
cool pines on the Mogollon Rim thanks to the early completion of a widening project on the 
Beeline Highway, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).
<P>An 11-mile stretch of the Beeline between McDowell Road and Shea Boulevard has 
been widened to a four-lane divided highway, cutting the travel time between Mesa and 
Fountain Hills about in half.  The trip can now be made in 15 to 20 minutes.
<P>The speed limit is 55 mph.
<P>Sundt Corp. of Tucson, which started the 
widening project in May, 1995, originally was not scheduled to complete the work until 
November.  Good construction weather and efficient work by the contractor, along with timely 
inspections by ADOT, led to the early completion in May.
<P>Sundt completed two new northbound lanes last November, just six months after they 
were started.  Two-way traffic was placed on the northbound lanes while the existing highway 
was reconstructed for the new southbound lanes.  This work was finished in five months.
<P>Planning for the $14.7 million McDowell to Shea project started in 1990 to relieve 
congestion and improve safety.  Following an initial study, the design work was completed in a 
&quot;very fast&quot; 11 months in 1994 by the consulting firm of Post, Buckley, Shuh and Jerigan.
<P>The State Transportation Board awarded the construction contract for the project in 
May, 1995.

Not only is she a woman in highway maintenance, but she is the supervisor of the otherwise all-male Winslow Maintenance unit.<p>
McCaualey, a 17-year ADOT veteran who became the Winslow Maintenance supervisor two years ago, said working among men has been a way of life for her.<p>
"I grew up on a ranch near Winslow where everything was male oriented," she said.  "You had to do your work there.<p>
"In addition, all the jobs I've had with ADOT have been predominately male jobs except when I was the maintenance secretary in Winslow for two years.  I started in construction and was the only woman on the (I-40) bypass projects among 300 men."<p>

McCauley spent eight years in construction in the Holbrook District before moving into materials testing in the Flagstaff District in 1990.  She returned to Holbrook two years later as the area lab supervisor and held that position until being named the Winslow Maintenance supervisor in 1994.<P>
McCauley, an all-business supervisor, said she gets lots of support from the 16 men who work for her.<p>
"They're good, personable guys," she said.  "They get along well.  They're a pretty good team.  They also treat me great.  They're very respectful.  They take real good care of me."<p>
Marcelo Vargas, a 27-year ADOT employee who has worked in Winslow Maintenance for 14 years, said McCauley is the best of three supervisors he has worked for.<p>
"She's real bright," Vargas said.  "For the time she's been in maintenance, she's picked up everything real quick."<p>
One thing that makes McCauley popular is the coffee can she keeps in her office with the names of all her employees.  McCauley pulls a name from the can whenever a special assignment-either good or bad-comes up.<p>
"That way I don't get accused of having a favorite." she said.  "It's kept arguments down.  It's worked really well."<p>
McCauley said she wishes she could do more for her employees, particularly in the way of higher wages.<p>
"They're not even half compensated for what we ask them to do,"  she said.  "They operate equipment that costs $160,000; they testify in court, including grueling depositions, when accidents occur; they work in hazardous situations, and they're stopped for all kinds of medical  emergencies."<p>
Concern for her employees and fair treatment are helping McCauley make her mark among maintenance supervisors.<p>

<P><B>As you can see the pay out from ASRS is far greater on a much smaller
amount of contributions. As the percentage of the salary you purchase increases
the greater the monthly benefit. If eligible, you may purchase prior covered
public service, military service and refunded ASRS service.</B><BR>
</P>

<P><B>**It would take an accumulation of $75,000 in the mutual fund and
a payout factor in the 6.5% range to equal the ASRS payment. </B><BR>

<p><font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Seatbelts:</b></font> Each person in the front seat of a car built after 1972 must have a seatbelt on and it must be properly fastened.  That means that every time you ride in a car, you must wear your seat belt.  Seatbelts reduce fatalities by 45 to 55 percent.  That means if you are in an accident, you are 50 percent safer with your seatbelt on then if you weren't wearing one.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><u><b>Child Safety Seats:</u></b></font> Required by Arizona law; if you have a child who is younger than four years of age or weighs less than 40 pounds, you must put the child in a safety seat.  Breaking this law can result in a fine of $50.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> The proper way to cross the street:</b></font> Before you cross the street, you should always stop at the corner and look for cars.  Crosswalks at intersections have crossing lights.  The green person walking means go and the red hand means stop.  If there is a car coming, wait until the car passes or comes to a complete stop, before you step off the curb.  Sometimes drivers don't see children on the sidewalk.  Once the driver stops, wait until you see the crosswalk signal that shows that its okay to cross the street.  If there is no light or crosswalk signal at the corner, make sure you wait until the car stops and the driver waves for you to cross.  Then you know the driver has seen you.  You should always walk inside the white lines of the crosswalk until you reach the other side of the street.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Turn Signals:</b></font> Other drivers expect you to keep doing what you're doing.  Signaling them lets them know you are planning to do something different.  This gives them time to react to your move.  The law requires you to signal 100 feet before you turn.  You should always signal before you: Change lanes, turn at an intersection or into a driveway, enter or leave a freeway.  Also, when you are going to cross a street, look for turn signals on approaching cars.  Cars can turn right on red or green lights.  That means a car might try to turn while you are trying to cross the street.  There are hand signals for people who are on bikes. <p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Areas Off Limits:</b></font> Storm drains, locked fences, medians, and construction areas.  These areas are not playgrounds and can be very dangerous for children.  There could be deep holes you might fall into or loose dirt.  The large construction trucks and tractors can not see you since they are so tall.  It is also unsafe for children, adults, and animals to ride in the back of a pick-up truck.  If the truck comes to a quick stop or is involved in an accident, the person or animal in the back of the truck can be thrown from the vehicle.  Animals may jump out of the vehicle while it is in motion.  These areas are all extremely dangerous.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Graffitti:</b></font> Graffiti is against the law.  Any person who recklessly defaces someone else's property is guilty of a crime. This includes more than just using spray paint.  It includes any destruction of someone else's property. Punishment could include a fine, going to jail, or both.  <br>
Here's a list of some possible punishments:<br>
<ol><li>A minimum two days juvenile detention or county jail time
<li> 80 hours of community service
<li>Full victim restitution  (pay for everything you damaged)
<li> Mandatory counseling for parents and juvenielle offenders at the parent's expense
<li> Fines of up to $10,000 to the parents of juvenile offenders
</ol><p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> Dust Storms:</b></font> Dust storms are common in Arizona and can sometimes reduce visability to zero.  If you run into a severe dust storm, reduce the speed of your vehicle immediately and drive carefully off the highway.  Turn off your vehicle's lights to ensure other cars do not follow you off the road and hit your vehicle.  Wait until the dust storm had passed before getting back on the highway.  If you are walking or riding your bike, get inside quickly or seek shelter.  Dust storms have a lot of flying debris that could be dangerous.</u></b></font><p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b> Snow Safety/Black Ice:</b></font> Turn on your headlights to see and be seen.  The same rules apply to bicyclists as well as motorists.  Apply the brakes gently, increasing the applied pressure as you feel the tires grip the road.  Do not apply the brakes to the point where the wheels lock.  If the wheels lock, ease off the brakes slightly, but do not release them completely.  Then apply the brakes and ease off again, repeating the process.<br>
<ul><li>Before you begin driving, clear snow and ice from all the car windows and lights.  Clear ice from all bike reflectors.
<li> Equip your car with snow tires or chains to help prevent skidding and reduce stopping distances.
<li> Drive gently, do not change speed or direction suddenly.
<li>Slow down before stopping or turning.  Driving on packed snow is much like driving on ice.
<li> Watch for ice on bridges and in shady areas.  Bridge surfaces freeze before other road surfaces.  
</ul>
<br>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Rain:</b></font> Slow down to increase the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you to at least four seconds, or double the normal distance.  Be extra careful driving during the first half hour after rain begins.  Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water and make the road slippery.  In heavy rain, your tires can lose all contact with the road. This is called hydroplaning. Deflated, worn, or bald tires can lose all contact with the road at much lower speeds.  The best way to prevent hydroplaning is to slow down.  If your car does hydroplane, take your foot off the accelerator, do not brake, avoid steering changes if possible, and hold the steering wheel firmly until your tires grip the road again.  Bicycles as well as cars can hydroplane.<p>
<font size="4" color=#8b2500><b>Bikes, Skateboards, In-line skates and Motor scooters:</b></font>  Make sure to always wear a helmet.  Do not ride on the highway or in traffic.  Wear bright colored clothes to help motorists see you better.  Wear all the required safety gear such as elbow pads and knee pads.  Always signal your movements for motorists.<p>
